## <u>Definitions</u>:
**Feature** (noun): An argument, action, style, etc. which people have different opinions on.

**Stance** (noun): An opinion of a feature.
## <u>Examples</u>
Examples of features:
* Kritiks
* Topicality
* Spreading
* Prep

Examples of stances (for Kritiks)
* they are good
* they are bad
* I think they are tools used by the iluminati

Notice how stances are not neccesarily on a linear scale, but rather are just binary classifications. This is intentional.

Te following is a list of features that will be included in the final product (tags are case insensitive)
```
Kritiks:
  Literature:
    <Klit1> I know no K literature
    <Klit2> I know one or two authors

  K affs
    <Ka0> Unfamiliar with kaff
    <Ka4> OMG K IS GREAT; any performance is legitimate.
    <Ka3> Neutral to K's; must relate to the resolution

    <Ka1> Hates K's     ; 

  Neg Ks
    <Kn0> Unfamiliar with kneg
    <Kn4> OMG K IS GREAT;
    <Kn3> Neutral to K's; require specific links
    <Kn2> Dislikes K's  ; needs strong link story
    <Kn1> Hates K's     ;

Topicality (NOT FRAMEWORK)
  <T5> Likes squirly T definitinos
  <T4> NEUTRAl:
  <T3> leans toward "normal" definitions but will vote on dropped stuff
  <T2> truth > tech, 2AC can drop it if it's bad.

  Other things:
    <nnf> No neg fiat
    <ncp> No counterplans
    <procCP2> Process counterplans are AMAZING
    <procCP1> Run theory vs process counterplan
    <procCP0> wont vote on process counterplans


Speed:
  Slow down for:
    <SlowCP> slow for counterplan text
    <SlowT> slow for T interps / definition
    <SlowK> slow for K debate
    <SlowTags> slow for tags
  
  Speed:
    <S4> Fast National Circuit level (400 WPM or more)
    <S3> Average National Circuit Speed (300 WPM - 400 WPM)
    <S2> Low National Circuit Speed (200 WPM - 300 WPM)
    <S1> Slightly faster than Lay (100 WPM - 200 WPM)
    <S0> What's spreading? (0 WPM - 100 WPM)

## How to make training data:
1. Either get some wikis from [mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/lv2ha24fxj6ji1n/paradigms.zip), or use the JS web scraper 
2. If you downloaded them from mediafire, extract the zip to .paradigms
3. Look through a paradigm, and find instances of stances. try to catch every single possible stance you can find in a file, as unlabled stances, when convertd into trianing data, hurt the overall performance of the network.
4. Lable each stance with the html tag above.
5. When you finish a file, add an underscore in front of the filename.
6. Run "5 - generateTrainingData.py if you want to generate tuples."
