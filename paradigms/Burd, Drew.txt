  I competed for Westlake High School for four years, and I graduated this past Spring (2016). I haven’t been particularly involved in debate since graduating, although I don’t think that will skew my evaluation of the round.

I enjoyed my time in debate, so I’ll try my best to judge the round and do my part (whatever that may be). Debate however you are best at debating so that the round will be enjoyable for all of us. I’ll evaluate the round however the debaters want me to, and I won’t “default” to any specific mode of interpretation. Similarly, I’ll vote for any argument that you win on the flow and that is extended throughout the round. (Don’t read arguments that are blatantly offensive or particularly silly, please.) Do your best and have fun!

I looked at Mark Gorthey’s paradigm when writing this. I may or may not judge like him. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at drew.burd4@gmail.com, or to ask me before/after the round.
