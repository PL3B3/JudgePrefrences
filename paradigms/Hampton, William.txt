  Tell me the story...

Prep Time: Don't steal prep but I'm lenient and will allow prep to stop after you flash over evidence. So prep stops when you tell me you're flashing. I debate as well so I know flashing can take at least an extra 30 secs due to tech issues.

Speed: I'm so-so with speed and that means I'm not the fastest but I can definitely flow you. And that means if you are like top 5 in the nation I might have a little trouble but that's it.

Arguments: I'm down to hear any arguments which means I'll vote on anything. I come from a background where I run whatever I like. I spent 5 years before college with the BAUDL and 3 years of that was national circuit. Most of my knowledge and skills come from summer camps and what I've been able to develop so I will understand the higher thinking kritiks as well as a disad and cp debate but if you're going to go with the K please don't be vague and offer up analysis. Don't assume I right off the back know what the philosophy is so where you can make the link and alt solvency explicit do it.

T: Is an argument like any other. There is a reason to win on this flow, don't forget offense.
K: Don't assume I know your critique literature. And by that I mean idk what D&G are ever saying w/o explanation.
CP: They need friends. And by that I mean net benefits that make them competitive/ a reason to vote for whoever is advocating for one.
DA: They cool.

AFF: Protect it like it's the Beezneez. It's your baby.

AND NEVER BE DISCOURAGED OR FEEL LIKE THE OTHER TEAM IS KILLIN, YOU GOTTA CATCH EM ALL CAUSE IT'S YOUR DESTINY. YOU NEED THE BALLOT AND IT NEEDS YOU.

SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST. (And for y'all who don't know what that means, just ask)
