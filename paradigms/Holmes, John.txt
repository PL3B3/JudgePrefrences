  I am a volunteer parent judge from New Hope, PA with 3 years experience in judging, primarily LD. I like to think of myself as an experienced traditional judge who is always learning and evolving. My preference is for debaters to speak at a pace that I can comprehend and take ample notes; allowing me to judge them fairly. I put emphasis on an articulated framework that is logical and supported from start to finish. I expect CLAIMS to be supported by WARRANTS that lead inevitably to IMPACTS regarding the resolution. Debate jargon is not appreciated and goes unrecognized by me. It is important that debaters be thoughtful, articulate and courteous when before me. Often debates to me are more about the quality then quantity of evidence that are put forth. My speaker points begin at 25 representing below average to 26/27 for average and 28/29 for excellence. Lastly debaters should exude a sense of enjoyment in the arguing of the resolution.
