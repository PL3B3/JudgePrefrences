 20+ years coaching—first tournament of the season, St. Mark's (because it’s the earliest we can compete).

 Please ask questions before the round if these remarks don't answer your questions. 

Paperless debate—love it. Stealing prep time—hate it. I won’t run prep while you are jumping your speeches, but that means everyone stops prepping while the files are being transferred.

I’m old fashioned and flow by hand. That means you need to slow down. 

I’m also old fashioned in that I prefer a policy approach. I’ll listen to all of the arguments and evidence presented, but if you need to win on theory, T, or a critical argument rather than an evaluation of the case v. the disad + case defense, or impact turns, or any cost/benefit approach; make sure you take my preferences into account when you are comparing your arguments with those of your opponents. Normally I’m a fan of politics; this year given the crazy quasi three-party system and Obama's complete lack of an agenda, you need to investigate the stories more deeply and thoroughly. NB: I haven't been paying much attention to the GOP primary stuff, so if you are running an early election scenario, you'll need to slow down and do some judge education on those issues. I know what I hear on NPR or read in the morning paper, but that's as deep as it goes on elections.

Debaters should use less jargon and explain their arguments in relationship to the competing arguments. In fact, I suggest that when you answer arguments you read less new evidence and instead make more nuanced explanations of the distinctions and warrants in your original cards. That doesn’t mean NEVER read new cards, just that you should read the best evidence first rather than last. 

Debate is about comparisons--the more you make on the way toward drawing sound conclusions, the better. 

Enjoy yourselves and debate well--
