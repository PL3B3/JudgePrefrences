        I am a parent of a competitor of the Mountain View/Los Altos High School Speech and Debate Team. This is my second year judging LD Debate.

I am a traditional parent judge with very little knowledge on the topic. I have a very basic flow and the person who's perceptually winning the round is a huge factor in my decision-making. Obviously theory and kritiks are a no-go unless you can explain the nuances of Michel Foucault's The Birth of Biopower to a layperson in 13 minutes.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, courtesy, and quality of argumentation. Intuitive, layered arguments are a good way to get high speaks from me.

Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
