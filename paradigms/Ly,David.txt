  Prior Debate Experience:
I did debate for four years in high school, with varying amounts of success.

Speed:
I could understand spread fairly well, but take note that I have been out of the highschool debate scene for quite some time. If I can't understand you, you might see me scratching my head in confusion. If I don't catch the argument, I'm not going to evaluate it in my decision, so take note to slow down where important.

Theory:
I enjoy a good theory debate that actually clashes as opposed to reading blocks straight out with no actual responses to the other person's blocks. Chances are, if you put some clash and respond to their arguments, I'll like you that much more. (This includes Topicality. I like topicality)

Kritiks:
Nothing personal against Kritiks, I was more of a CP/DA debater, although I did go for them in the 2nr occasionally. I will vote on Kritiks, but in order for that to happen, I need a good link story/impact and you're going to have to articulate your evidence and warrants well. If you're going to be spreading as fast as you can, I suggest you slow down, ALOT, during the Kritik, at least during the tags.

Counterplans:
I like counterplans, especially advantage counterplans. PICs/delays/other kinds of CPs are fine, just be careful to prove why they are competitive.

Disads:
Er. Not much to say here..?

All this said, I will vote on fancy new arguments or even bad arguments so long as they win the round, go unanswered, or just have good support. I do believe that any argument can win the round, properly impacted, including the genocide good arguments and such, but take care not to be too offensive. I do NOT like rudeness in round, I would like every debater to be amiable. If you appear to be a douche, you can be sure your speaks will be hurt badly. 

All in all, I feel that I was very vague here. Just ask specific questions in round to clarify.
