  I debated for 3 years in high school in a couple of different types of debate, and then debated policy for 4 years at Cal Poly. 

I ran mostly policy args, but I spent a large portion of my career writing blocs to answer K's. So maybe I'm somewhat equally versed in both worlds? 

I like debate, I like smart arguments, I like judging. Let's keep that up.

I like procedurals - more precisely, I like procedurals that are smart, contextual, and sophisticated. 

Disclaimer - I don't understand why the K outweighs case most of the time, and I am rarely ever convinced that the alt solves the case. That doesn't mean don't run it, do your thing and do it well, and I will do my best to adjudicate the round objectively.
