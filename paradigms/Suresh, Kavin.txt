  Hello friends! I have a little PF experience from High School, but that's pretty much it. 

I don't have much to say, but here are a few general guidelines for you guys. 

Don't spread too hard. If I don't catch something you say, it will not be flowed. It's your obligation to keep your speed reasonable. Don't go too slow though!

Keep a reasonable volume. Your opponents and I should be able to hear you clearly. Don't be that one dude who thinks yelling makes you a good debater. 

Signpost your arguments. I'm a lazy bum, so I want everything laid out for me. 

Follow the rules. Don't mess with your timers, internet, etc. to gain an unfair advantage. Don't misrepresent evidence, that's not kewl. If I catch wind of anything sus, it's game over for you. 

I expect y'all to time yourselves. If I end up doing it, my focus won't be on the debate, something you guys probably don't want.

Don't be too technical haha, I probably won't understand what is going on.


Finally, be courteous and have fun! Don't scream at each other in CX ya knuckleheads. Give everyone their fair share of speaking time in CX. 

Honestly, this is all stuff you guys probably already do by second nature, but I'm just reiterating it. I don't really care what you guys do as long it follows these guidelines.
