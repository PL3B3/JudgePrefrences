  I have four years of high school debate experience under my belt. I've competed in LD and PF on a Florida local circuit. I'm now a sophomore at UF. I keep a rigorous flow, and I make my final decision based off of it. I strongly prefer traditional arguments (aka not K's, theory, etc). However, if a counterplan is presented in a traditional way, I am willing to consider it. If speed was on a 5 point scale (5 being spreading), I would probably be a 3.5. I can't handle spreading, but I can flow a slightly faster pace. I will put my pen down if it's too fast. I'm not sure if this is a common thing to leave out, but a value and value criterion are absolutely necessary. Finally, you won't find me flipping a coin to make a final decision. I'm always excited to judge so I'm attentive in round and will put in the time/effort required to evaluate the round before I make a decision on the ballot.
