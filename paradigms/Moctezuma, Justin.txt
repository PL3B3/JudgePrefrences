  I am currently attending Foothill College, and I've been judging debate for Menlo-Atherton for about three years, now. I've judged JV and Varsity in every forum, and I often find myself being used in the out-rounds at tournaments.

I am willing to listen to any argument, and I enjoy debate, so there is little that I discourage. So long as you are clear and audible, I'll be able to follow. I do feel that it's important for you to impact your arguments, though, and bad impacts can be a deciding factor in a round.

If you're going to spread, don't mumble. I've judged a few rounds where the debaters spoke unnervingly quickly without losing clarity, but it seems that more often than not, words and thoughts get jumbled. At moderate speeds, this is fine, but I'd encourage you not to speak at a higher speed than you can articulate your words at. In any event, I'll be flowing whatever it is being debated.

In policy debate, I tend to be a stock issues judge, but I'm familiar with the policy makers paradigm, as well.

Other than that, have fun, and enjoy what you do!
