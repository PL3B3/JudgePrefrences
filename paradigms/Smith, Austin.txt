  About Me:

I am a second year at Cal majoring in History and Political Science. I have multiple years of debate experience, mainly in Parli and Pufo. I have experience judging LD, Pufo, and Parli.

General Rules:
I am a flow judge
If there is no framework defined in round I will judge according to utilitarian net benefits 
Quality of evidence is key
Rhetoric is important and matters to me
Do not abuse the opponents 

For Policy:
Be clear
Provide good warrants and explain why your evidence is relevant
I am willing to buy anything in Policy so long as it is said in a clear way

For LD:
Spread slowly
I am fine with any theory

For Parli:
All theory is in play for Value and Policy Debates but not for Fact Debates that are supposed to be more similar to PF
Define the type of debate you plan on having right off the top of the first speech
AFF does not automatically have right to define, I will not buy that against a T
Structure is everything in Pali, please make your arguments very clear and follow all exact rules especially on voters that come up in Parli a lot (T’s, K’s, etc.)

For PF:
THIS IS NOT POLICY!!!! Speed is good but DO NOT start spreading
You cannot provide plans, some general advocacies are fine but do not try and win by creating policy like plans that other teams cannot respond to 
FLOW YOUR ARGUMENTS ALL THE WAY, if something is not mentioned in the 3 IT IS DROPPED. I cannot even tell you how many teams do this and get away with it because of poor judge flow. Since it ended my high school debating career on a sour note it is my largest pet peeve, meaning I am very likely to drop you if you do this
Pretty much the only theory I will buy in PF is time skew, severance or topicality (no need to structure this formally) as PF is not supposed to be about a ton of theory
No new arguments after the 2 and no new evidence after the 3 
Please provide voting issues at the start of the 3 and begin to amalgamate contentions to make weighing the final impacts easier 
Framework debate is highly encouraged but should be left to a reasonable level as PF is not LD
Crossfire is for debaters clarification not judges judgments so please do not try to grandstand during a CX. It will have no effect on my vote
