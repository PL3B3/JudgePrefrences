I vote on logic and a thorough understanding and explication of your value and criterion. I am fine with moderate to fast speed, but I prefer fewer high-quality arguments to a multitude of poor or irrelevant ones, or arguments that seek to get away from actually engaging with the resolution. Theory is fine, if you can explain it well and if it adds something productive to our discussion of the topic. I'm not a fan of generic K's.

LD is my favorite form of debate, because I believe that when it's done well, it causes all three of us to think about how we should be in the world. Embrace the larger Why and you'll be most of the way to getting my vote. Also, impact your drops and tell me why and how to vote during your final speech. Be civil and thoughtful and enjoy the round.
