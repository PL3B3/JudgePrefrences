  I debated for MVLA (Los Altos) class of 2012 and received two bids to the TOC. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Cornell University.

Speed. I can flow Busta Rhymes. Be as clear as him, and I can flow you too. Slow down for tag lines and author names and signpost well.

Theory. I like good theory. Disclosure theory is bad theory. AFC is bad theory. Deontology is unfair is bad theory. Coin flip theory is bad theory. Discourse is generally bad theory. I will vote on these, but your speaks will be below 27.5. I vote on RVI's and the rest is up to you.

Phil. I like philosophy, but I want you to explain it to me like I'm stupid.

Other. I'm down for almost anything you do that isn't offensive, I have some preferences: I prefer truth-testing paradigm, competing interps for theory and I'm not a big fan of plans/K's but I'll vote off anything as long as you justify why I should.

Want speaks? I average 27.5 to 28. Here's how to do better:
A. WEIGH things beautifully. This is the way to get my ballot and my speaks.
B. Make clever references to a show/book/song that I like.
C. Win decisively. Don't be messy around the flow, but go in on the arguments you're winning. If you don't win decisively and I make my decision. Don't go around complaining that you got "judge f***ed" - if you tell me where I should vote then chances are that's where I will vote.
D. Make the round interesting and look like you're having fun (I don't care if you actually are).
E. Be funny, but not offensive.
F. Run interesting, creative positions. (I will only give 30s to positions that aren't at least nuanced stock arguments)

Ask me questions before the round, it makes me feel smart.
