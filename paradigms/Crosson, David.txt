  I've experienced a variety of different debating styles in high school (PoFo, Congress, Parli, Extemp, CX) and as such have found myself to be a lot more 'balanced' in my approach to debate… I consider this to be "Speech & Debate" not just listing arguments. My debating preferences as such are simple:
I DO NOT like spreading … speed for the sake of getting your arguements in is obviously acceptable but if you spread for the sake of spreading, I will stop writing. If you are unclear, I will call 'clear' to signify that your last point was not communicated effectively and you should make it more clear. I like extensions but they should specify a clear 'claim', 'warrant' and 'impact.'I presume the burden of proof is on the Aff. However, I am friendly to additionally weighing mechanisms if they are well proven. Time yourselves … please Talk the way you want me to write it down on my flow chart … My favorite line to hear: "On your flow chart you should see..."Brevity is the soul of wit: don't try to impress me by 'talking smart'
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I take a 'blank slate' approach as the judge in this event … even if I disagree with your opponent's argument, I will keep it on my flow chart unless you address it.
I HAVE voted for someone who said we should put Gatling guns on our border to scare away the Mexicans …. while I found this to be completely racist and ineffective (probably illegal), his opponent's only reply was "that's stupid" which is not an argument.

To simply put it ... if they state it, you should debate it. Persuade me…
And if any of this doesn't make sense, ask me before round starts. 

Credo Baby, Credo
