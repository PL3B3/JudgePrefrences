  I am a grandparent judge affiliated with University School (FL)

I find debate interesting and do not have a debate background. I judged PF at wake forest, Princeton and Columbia and Vestavia Hills will be my first LD tournament. I do not like speed and will not be able to understand what you are saying. In order to win my ballot you will have to persuade me.
