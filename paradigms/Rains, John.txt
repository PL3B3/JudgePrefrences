  2008 JUDGE PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT: 
 
NAME: John H. Rains, III  INSTITUTION: Tampa Prep 
POSITION: Volunteer High School Debate Coach and Practicing Attorney 
 
YEARS OF COACHING: 15 years 
 
Number of Rounds this Year: 40 
 
Theory: 1.  I default to policymaking where no paradigm is argued. 2. I believe topicality is evaluated on the basis of competing interpretations. 3. I have no particular theory orientation for counterplans and focus more on actual than potential abuse. 4. New cases are fine. 
 
Topic Specific: I have no preference for particular topicality arguments. I have no preference for particular disadvantages or counterplans. I would prefer not to hear arguments that I believe are false, e.g. low level radiation is good for your health (my father died of cancer). I have not done any specific in depth research on this topic. 
 
Kritiques/Deontology: My preference is to hear arguments that have some link to the affirmative and have an impact. I tend to want more explanation of Kritiques and development of the positions. 
 
Evidence: My preference is not to read evidence unless there are specific arguments about the quality or warrants about the evidence. I prefer source, date and some qualifications to help me weigh the evidence. 
 
Style: I use the word “CLEAR” to indicate that I cannot understand what is being said. I appreciate being able to flow plan text, counterplan text and permutations. I generally prefer for debaters to speak for themselves (it shows respect for partners, etc), but if an interjection is needed by one partner to assist the other or to ask a few questions, then that is fine. I try not to be distracted by a debater’s mannerisms, but certain things, such as tapping on tubs while speaking, can affect my concentration. 
  
 Miscellaneous: I prefer substantive debate to theory debates. I watch the 2AR carefully for new arguments and evaluate the 2AR arguments based on what I think the 2NR could reasonably anticipate.
