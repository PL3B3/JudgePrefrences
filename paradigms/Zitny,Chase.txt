My name is Chase Zitny and i did 4 years of debate in High school. Here's my overall views but also feel free to ask specifics in round.

I'm a flows judge.Not huge on speed. I would rather you take the time to talk out/ explain your arguments rather then just hitting me with a bunch of things at once.*v/c debate is just as important as the contentions debate. Please spend equal time on them.
*I'm a clean slates judge. Meaning i walk into the room knowing nothing until you guys tell me the information.
If something is dropped please bring it up in every speech, or i will not consider it dropped; due to the speech times in LD.I'm ok with any type of bizarre argument as long as you can back it up.*I do know a bit about philosophy due to doing L.D for 4 years. but if you use specific Philosophers please do a good job at explaining what they stand for and how its apparent to your case
Cant tell you how many times I've seen R.A's get dropped, so if you have one please extend it through every speech, and always address your opponents R.A, or they could potentially get away with some very abusive framework. And i would hate to see you lose on a technicality.
