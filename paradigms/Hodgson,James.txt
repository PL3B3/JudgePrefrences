  Debated four years at Sky View High School, now assistant coach for the same. My University only has a debate club not a formal team, I am involved with the club.

This is your game, have fun, debate well, build relationships.

In general
I will be open to any argument. I was a critical debater myself and like creative, well explained critical debate. Speed is not a problem, slow down on tags and authors for optimal flowing on my part. I don't love blatant multiple advocacies on either side, you can run CP's and K's but I prefer a Neg strat that all works together. In the final speeches give me obvious voting issues and well explained impact scenarios. I am more likely to vote on what you would like me to if you tell me where to focus.

Specifics
As far as specifics I probably have a slight Aff bias on topicality, usually if I vote on T it's off of in-round abuse. Beyond that I am open to everything and enjoy creative strategy.
