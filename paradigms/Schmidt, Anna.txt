  I have been involved with debate for the past 13 years, the past 6 as a judge, and the remaining as a competitor in Jr. High (Mountain Ridge), High school (Lone Peak), and College (UVU). I competed my Sophomore year in Policy, my Junior year in LD, my Senior year in PF, and two years of College in Parli. My Junior year I competed at nationals in HI, and my Senior year I took first in State in Oratory, and I was the captain of UVU's debate team. I am primarily an IE debtor, but I am familiar with most debate arguments. I have several siblings that are actively competing in debate right now, and I am the mother of 4.

I like to see clear arguments that are easy to follow. I can handle some spreading (as long as you slow down on key info such as taglines), but if it detracts from your presentation and clarity you would do better to speak at a normal rate. I love clear voters, and appreciate concise summaries of arguments. I expect you to tell me which argument I should vote for and why, especially why it is a better voter than the other team's argument.

I will vote for any argument as long as it is supported by the winning framework. For example, I will vote for an impact of effecting the people in the room over nuclear war, as long as it is justified through the framework and makes sense as the most realistic and important impact. That being said, we are here to discuss big issues, and generally I view bigger impacts as having more weight.
