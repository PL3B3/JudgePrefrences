  Judging Paradigm: Lincoln-Douglas

Experience: I have been coaching LD debate at Barrington High School for 3 years. I have judged LD rounds primarily in the Chicago-area local circuit. All in all, I think debate should be an educational activity.

Criteria for Judging: Lincoln-Douglas debate is a debate over values. I try to pay close attention to the clear link between the value criterion and the value. I like when debaters use a variety of evidence, including philosophy, hypothetical situations, and real-world examples. Additionally, impacts are important and need to be emphasized. As far as theory goes, you need to be very explicit and detailed so that I can follow your logic.

Speed: Debate is about rhetoric and persuasiveness. Therefore, I must be able to understand what you are saying!
