  I debated for Mission San Jose High School for 4 years on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC during my senior year. I’m conflicted with Mission San Jose and Rosemount.

Short Version:
You can run almost anything in front of me but know I’m better at evaluating some debates than others (Ks, Theory, Util over framework heavy). Speed is fine but work your way up to top speed. Speaker points are determined on strategy choice and perceptual dominance; make smart decisions and give me an easy time signing the ballot.

Long Version: 

Theory/T: Default to competing interpretations and drop the argument. Used to debate this a lot in high school so I’m happy to listen to a good theory round. I also grant pretty substantial leeway on RVIs given the time constraints in rebuttal speeches.

Ks/Narratives/Performance: Fine with it but I would prefer some sort of link to the topic. Also make the role of the ballot especially clear when running these positions. If I don’t know why I need to vote for you, I wont.

Evidence Ethics, Clipping, Other Bad Stuff: I’ll typically default to tournament procedure when it comes to these issues. If you accuse an opponent of clipping cards and have a recording that I can listen to then the round stops and I evaluate the recording. If your opponent clips s/he loses and if you’re wrong, you lose. If you accuse your opponent of severely mischaracterizing evidence, I’ll call for the card after the round and make an appropriate judgment (don’t have to read a theory shell saying “Miscut Evi Bad”). If the card was not miscut, I will severely dock your speaker points.

Arguments I won’t evaluate:
- Indicting something your opponent did outside of the round (Disclosure Theory, Didn’t Coin Flip, Said something mean on FB, etc.) As far as I’m concerned this is none of my business.
- Arguments that I determine make the debate round unsafe (personal attacks, racism, homophobia, etc.)
