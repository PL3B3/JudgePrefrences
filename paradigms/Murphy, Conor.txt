  I consider myself to be a tabula rasa judge. The rounds belong to the debaters, and to push a paradigm onto them is against my overall debate philosophy. I love the K debate, if it is well done. As for TOC level theory debates, I hope debaters never take it for granted that the judge, no matter how smart, holds the same viewpoints on game playing as they do. For that reason, I like having my paradigm defined to me in a round! Again, it is your debate! Take ownership of it. Debate is a game, sure, but you make the rules!
