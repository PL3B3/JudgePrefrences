  I am a coach of Nashua High School Debate team. This is my second year judging policy debate. I have judged about 15 rounds. Spreading must be very clear, and can't be too fast, or else I will be unable to flow. I will consider Kritiks, if they are logical. All other policy arguments are fine, they just need to be explained well.
