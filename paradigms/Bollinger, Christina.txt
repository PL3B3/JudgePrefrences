  I'm new to the debate world this year (2011), but have learned a lot from watching many practice debates at the UofM summer camp.

I'm open to all types of arguments. However, I tend to find Critique a bit confusing if not explained clearly and thoroughly. I'm also a fan of Topicality arguments, as long as they make sense.

Also, I do have a hearing loss in my left ear, thus making it imperative that debaters speak loudly and clearly so I don't miss anything. But I usually position myself in the room so that my right ear is closest to the speaker.
