Background:

I competed in IHSA state circuit speech throughout high school for Wheaton Warrenville South, graduating with sectional, regional and state titles. I entered the judging circuit almost two years ago after helping coach a speech and debate camp. The more experienced coaches I've worked with for the past year or so have brought me into the fold with a national circuit mindset when it comes to LD. However, my experience in speech and my expertise in coaching debaters on presentational skill has kept me informed on local debate values.

Judge Philosophy:

What I want to see in round: Unique, interesting and inspired cases. Good value critereon debate. Voters: since I'm not the world's most experienced judge, it really benefits you to tell me clearly why you're winning. Competitive worlds: I'm rather fond of them. Given my background, good presentational skill is a plus. Theory: good when it's valid in my eyes, but I won't always vote off it. I adhere to reasonability. 

What I don't want to see: I won't call cards. If you're winning every little nitpicky evidence argument but your opponent gets at the big picture, I'll pick up your opponent. Also, if your net benefits are too idealistic, I won't buy them unless you really sell it presentationally. And in particular: don't run theory if your opponent gives a really unique case (see: things I like â¬†) and you feel like it's "unfair" because it came out of left field. That would be lame.
