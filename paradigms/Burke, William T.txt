I am big on oratory ability; I should never think…“How long, O Debater, will you abuse our patience? And for how long will that madness of yours mock us? To what end will your unbridled audacity hurl itself?” This means that I err towards honesty, clarity, and respect towards the opponent when I judge rounds…to quote a colleague:

“I like to see cases clearly linked backed the standards. I tend to favor pragmatic arguments over pure philosophy. When it comes to philosophy, I prefer simple philosophy over highly complex philosophy. When it comes to evidence, I prefer that it be clearly warranted. I try to process your arguments as the round progresses. As such, excessive speed can be detrimental. Signposts and crystallization are always helpful. Treat me like a traditional judge with an emphasis on clear communication.”
