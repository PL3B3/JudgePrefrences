I debated PF long long ago. I consider myself a novice judge at this point.

I would love to see a healthy debate based on theory and kritik arguments.
I expect good framework laid out on both sides and strong but direct rebuttal. 
IMO, a good case with solid theory can be slow but will make a valid original point of view. 
Be creative, original with our case and bring a strong point of view on rebuttal.

Good luck!
