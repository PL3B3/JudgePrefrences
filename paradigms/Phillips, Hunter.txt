Arguments:

Topicality: The affirmative should defend a plan that is resolutional. I'm open to listening to most any argument related to topicality, with the exception being critiques of topicality. I'll have a hard time finding most of those arguments very compelling, but if it's something very specific and applicable to a given topicality that's been run, I'll probably evaluate it.

Disadvantages: Impact Calculus/Comparison. That is all. Actually, it's not. I love politics debates, but make sure your uniqueness is up to date, or else I will be sad.

Counterplans: I read a counterplan every negative round for three years in high school, so they're definitely my absolute preference. On past topics, I've really enjoyed big agent counterplans, but I was also very much into so-called "cheating" counterplans like Delay. As long as it can be justified by a solid theory argument, I'm game for whatever counterplan you can come up with.

Kritiks: I was NOT a kritik debater in high school, but I was passionate about the framework debates involved. I'm not as well-versed in kritik literature as I'd like to be, but I can hang with most of the fare that's common in high school debate. There are some kritiks that I came across during my debate years that I absolutely despised-Time Cube, the "God" K, Deleuze/Guattari. If I hear one of these, you'll be facing an uphill battle for the ballot, but I'll try my best to put my predispositions aside.

Theory: Theory debates were my bread and butter in high school, so I'm open to hearing just about anything. Disclaimer: I'll be less receptive to shell-on-shell theory debates without much clash. There's nothing worse than a theory debate that has two ships sailing in opposite directions. But, if you debate theory well, I will definitely vote on it.

Performance Debate: Ugh, this is a tough spot for me. I like watching performance debate, but it's really, really ridiculously difficult to judge. I need a very clear reason as to why your advocacy should be evaluated as superior to a traditional affirmative. Also, your framework has to give a clear statement of the role of the ballot, or else I'll be more swayed by framework arguments leaning towards the traditional.

Case: Do it if you can do it well. Don't read case for the sake of wanting to spreadâ€” do it because there's a specific reason to read it.

Basically, I will listen to anything. I'm extremely receptive to a good framework debate, but I love counterplans and topicality as well. Clarity is extremely important. Have a sense of humor about things, it'll make it more enjoyable for everyone. Don't go for too much in the 2NR; just keep it simple. Above all else, be nice, and have some fun.
