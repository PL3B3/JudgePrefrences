  - I expect clear and easily recognized arguments that are backed up by the speaker's value and value criterion.
- All arguments should follow a line of logical reasoning.
- I like to hear voting burdens being established in the round.
- Dropped contentions are strongly discouraged but I do not expect each individual example to be addressed.
- My vote will go to whichever speaker gives the best arguments regardless of my personal opinions on the issue.
