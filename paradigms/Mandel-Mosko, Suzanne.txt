  I AM A LAY JUDGE

I am not familiar with policy arguments like K's, theory, T, DA's etc. Be careful with plans and CPs; use them as arguments instead of the structured plan or CP. I've judged most all events, primarily LD though.I don't buy nuke war or extinction impacts. Don't run some really weak linked arguments just for large scale impacts.I am a parent of a senior that does varsity LD and have been frequently judging for 4 years now. She has tried to teach my flow arguments on occasion, but nothing has really stuck. I can flow, but I am in no means a "flow" judge. I have no previous debate experience other than judging. I prefer topic specific, case level debate. Contention level debate is probably best.Don't run confusing frameworks or philosophies. Do not run theory, I feel like you are just avoiding the debate. However, do not use this as an excuse to be blatantly abusive.Try and clash arguments. Don't talk too fast, and be clear. I'm not comfortable with spreading. Also, I know how speaker points work (some judges don't get the 25-30 range).Use cross-x to your advantage. Don't be downright mean.I'm from Southern California which may or may not be applicable in deciding what to run. I am politically liberal, but that doesn't sway how I vote. I often times find myself voting more times for the side I would be politically not in favor of at the end of a tournament.Feel free to ask questions before round if you are so inclinedDisclaimer- my daughter helped me write this to better advise debaters doing prefs.
