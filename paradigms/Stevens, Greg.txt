I judge LD and policy a couple times a year so I can usually flow debaters if they spread when they are clear. If you are exceptionally fast, you probably should slow down a little bit especially for tags and analysis in rebuttals so I can catch the most important things.

Framework is really important. It is the way you evaluate impacts.

In terms of theory, I want it to be clean and easy to evaluate so crystalize and I will likely vote on it. I am not accustom to some of the newer theory arguments like offensively worded interps so please be clear. If the argument is abusive, tell why and how, and I will consider it. Don't go for abuse on a something that is not abusive.

My biggest pet peeve is having refutation in the round. I don't mind some use of strategy and trying to outweigh, but I will hold credence to arguments that have been made. I do not like bad advocacy. Conditional counterplans on the neg should be avoided because of the time skew. In the last speech, I don't expect a line by line as much a crystallization and voting issues.

If you are reading a K, please give me a clear ballot story. Unfortunately, I find it harder to vote on pre-fiat issues because of my traditional policy background but I keep an open mind.

NO MICROPOL

I coach all styles of debate. The past three years I have coached LD after Jack Ave coached LD most of the previous two years. I usually judge LD at TOC tournaments.
