  I am a lay judge. I judge for La Costa Canyon High School.
This is my 4th year judging Policy. I have judged about 20 or 30 rounds of LD over the years.
I describe myself as a 'Flop' or Flow Parent. I am comfortable with most arguments, but am no doubt more literal than more sophisticated judges. I am not easily offended and want the debaters to enjoy the round (and hence make my 90 minute investment worth the effort).
I have only judged about 5 rounds on the current 2008 policy topic.
At Meadows in 2007, I started judging in round 3 and generally got 0-2, 0-3 and 1-3 rounds. In short, if I'm judging, your tournament could be going better.
In the end, I take a holistic approach and find the debate is often clarified during the cross x sessions.
I don't mind tag teaming.
I will ask for evidence. I will laugh at any evidence from Fox News or similar sources.
I do want Obama to win.
I expect to be struck by the best teams at any tournament.
Good luck.
