  Intro: 
I debated for 4 years at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA) mostly on the TFA circuit, graduated in 2015. I am not debating in college. I am generally fine with everything, feel free to ask any specific questions. I'll give an extra 0.5 speaker points for debating on linux.

Copy-paste from the TFA questionnaire (not sure how useful that will be):

Stylistic Issues (Speed, Quantity)
Speed is fine, clearly delineating taglines is helpful

Speaker Point Scale
I give 27s to 29.5s, the average is usually a 28.5

Theory (Aff/Neg)
I guess I don't really like things like PIKs or process counterplans because they're pretty boring, but I ran them all the time and have no problem voting for them so the objection should be warranted and not just 10 seconds of the 1AR.

Topicality
I actually enjoy listening to well-warranted topicality debates, so I'll certainly vote for it if it's explained well.

Counterplans
I tend to enjoy creative, case-specific counterplans over generics.

Disadvantages
Evidence comparison is very important.

Kritiks
I mainly debated the K in high school so I'm perfectly fine with them, but I think more explanation almost always beats a bunch of cards in the 2NC. The more case-specific the better. I may not understand all the jargon so make sure you either use more normal language or a good explanation of what a word means. 

Performance/Projects
I've never judged anything like it before, but I have no problem with it.
