  Hello, my name is Ranjeet Sidhu. I am a former national circuit debater who graduated high school in 2004. I debated for Clovis West High School and Central California College Prep (CCCP). I also coached the Loyola High School Lincoln-Douglas debate team between 2005 and 2008 and taught at the Stanford National Forensic Institute between 2004 and 2007. I have not been very involved with debate since graduating college in 2008.

I like arguments that are related to the resolution and responsive to your opponent's position. I don't much care for theory or a priori arguments.

Speed is fine if necessary, however your speaker points will drop if you're not clear. Also, I don't appreciate using speed as a tactic to confuse your opponent. 

I typically assign speaker points between 25 and 30. I only assign 30s to debaters who are technically strong and oratorically talented.

Please weigh your arguments. I cannot stress this enough.

If you have additional questions please feel free to ask me before the round.
