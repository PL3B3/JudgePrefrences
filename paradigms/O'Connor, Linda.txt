  As a judge, I look for the following when evaluating Student Congress:
1. Preparation- Come with current, relevant sources to support your viewpoint. Do not make up sources or statistics. A judge can (and should) question your sources, and you should be prepared to show a print copy of your research. Pronounce words and proper names correctly.
2. Participation- Be active in the chamber. This includes being attentive to other speakers, asking questions and speaking with authority.
3. Debate- Each speech should address the issues presented by previous speakers and add some new element to the debate. If you have no new information to offer, and you cannot refute other speakers, don't expect a good score.
4. Analysis- Read the legislation carefully. If you don't understand the issues, ask someone to explain them to you, so you can do research and participate in the debate. Debate the bill as written, not the bill you want it to be, and make your argument logical. If you don't believe what you're saying, no one else will.
5. Style- Know your information well enough to sound convincing and make eye contact. Move naturally as you speak. Never read a pre-written speech.
6. Questioning- Use questions to get clarification, question the validity of sources and ask the speaker to defend his position. Do not use question time to give your own speech.
7. Respect- Be respectful and debate without being hostile.
8. Work- Your job is to convince the judges and the other representatives to support your viewpoint. Good debate is hard work.
