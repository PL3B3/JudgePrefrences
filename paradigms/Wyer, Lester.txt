  My son and daughter have both been involved in the policy debate program, but I have no debate experience myself. So if you want me to understand you, you will need to speak slowly and not use jargon. Your argumentation will need to well explained and you need to tell me where I should vote. 

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask.
