  I debated for Spanish River High School in Boca Raton, Fl. primarily on the national circuit for 2 1/2 years, graduating in 2007. I currently study philosophy at New York University. 

I'll keep this concise and in keeping with the few specific things I prefer to see in round:

1. Clarity of argumentation at both the verbal and structural levels. Ideally you should be able to articulate yourself in a precise and effective manner given the constraints of speech time and breadth of arguments; the structure of your speeches, as well as your individual arguments, should reflect your perception of how different aspects of the debate interact. 

2. Some semblance of a clear impact calculus, or hierarchy of argumentation, that enables me to assign weight to competing claims. 

3. This isn't a call for decorum or a reactionary plea for manners, but I think that personal composure and the way that you carry yourself in round bears a not inconsiderable influence upon both your competitors and the judge. You should project both integrity and intellectual confidence, to appear serious without all the farce that comes from cocky debater syndrome. Really, I can assure you that I have absolutely no knowledge of your competitive history - you'll be judged upon the strength of your argumentation and the means by which you articulate your position. This is a preference of mine and is in no way a determining factor in the decision. 

4. Nuanced positions that demonstrate lucidity and a sophisticated understanding of the resolution are preferable; philosophically sophisticated argumentation, or positions whose value isn't solely determined by abstruseness, are even better. 

5. Speed has not, and most likely will never be, an issue. Theory is more than acceptable provided there is an apparent threshold for abuse that has been met, though that requirement isn't absolute.
