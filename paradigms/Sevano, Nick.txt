  My philosophy/paradigm for judging LD Debate:

For the most part, I am a traditional LD judge. I like to see a great deal of thoughtful, point-by-point clash, a synthesis of the philosophical and pragmatic, and an adherence to the dignity that this event demands. I do not favor rounds steeped in debate theory or game playing; however, I do not mind discussions on definitions as long as they are relevant and critical. I feel that the criteria in a debate round should be process oriented, not some vague notion substantiated by other vague notions. I expect students to link subarguments and analysis back to the criteria and overall value premise and to keep each other honest through cross examination and rebuttal.
