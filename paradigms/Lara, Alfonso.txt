  I debated for two years at James Logan High on the local policy level. I am now a Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas coach for MSJHS.

Speed: It has been a couple years since I have heard circuit level speed so take that as you will. Anything above 200 WPM should be extremely clear, by that I mean slow down at the taglines and sign post well and often (this is especially true for theory). I will yell clear 3 times before I let my flow turn into a bluish-red wad engraved with the incoherent howls of your debate. (This will hopefully change soon, but for now, don't risk it.)

CP: If the best option after the round includes the full resolution/plan, default ballot is Aff. Other than that go crazy (Which means you should have good theory to defend against the crazy).

Kritiks: I am very familiar with Cap, Nietzche, and Biopower. Anything else and you will have to give a very detailed explanation for (Which probably means less speed). Do not run Lacan or DnG unless you think you can teach it to me in 5 minutes or less.

Standard: I am most familiar with the philosophies of Rawls, Kant, Nietsche, Nozick, Mill, and Hobbes. Anything else and you will have to give a very detailed explanation for (Which probably means less speed). 

Evidence: I do not do appeals to authority. Cards must contain warrants which are held to the same accountability as the debater's warrants. An explanation of the methodology should be a part of every empirical study read in the round.

Extending: I do not extend anything without at least a tagline worth of summary and author if included.

Speaker Points: In order of importance: organization, argumentation, and presentation. Please Note - If CX gets way too heated and I look furious, someone is getting a 0.
