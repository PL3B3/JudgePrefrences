  I am a parent judge and this is my second year of judging Middle School debates, especially Public Forum.
I appreciate when teams present their Standard in clear term and every one of their contentions strengthen their standard.
I can very well follow a speech that is delivered very fast. But don't necessarily like it when it is done just for the sake of being fast.

If there is a legitimate to speed(have too many refutations to make, for instance), by all means go for it.
I do not like it when a team or an individual suddenly wakes up in the final focus and clarifies all of their muddled arguments

from earlier part of the debate. I vote based on your performance in the whole round, not just the final focus.
Last but not least, be civil and treat opponents with respect. Agreeably disagree.
