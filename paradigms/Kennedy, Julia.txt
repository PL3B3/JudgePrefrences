  Hey everyone!

I'm a first year out, currently a student at Fordham University in the Bronx, and am very excited to be judging! I attended Nova High where senior year I founded and coached our Lincoln Douglas team, so I have a very extensive, but not completely exhaustive, understanding of LD. I am very well versed in debate events- fresman & sophomore year I competed in congress and junior year I did PF. So I'm great at following logic- if you are going to run something tricky I'm totally capable to judge it, just make sure you explain it well.



I'm pretty much open to anything you wanna throw at me. With a few limitations of course. If you are at all sexist, racist, homophobic, or rude to your opponent, expect me to call you out and don't expect speaks higher than 25. I'm fine with speed to an extent- if you want to spread that's fine just don't expect me to get every word down. If it's important, better bring it up in your later speeches. I love to hear out of the box stuff - in high school I ran a bomb af rage fem k - so I love that stuff. 


I'm sure I left out some things here so I'll be posting updates but feel free to email me with any questions!



‚ù§, Julia Kennedy
