I debated at Mission San Jose High School in California for four years and graduated in 2016. I mostly read util and theory.

Debate is your activity and I don't have a strong preference for any particular sort of argument, so do whatever you want. I will vote on any argument as long as it is warranted.

I mainly assign speaks based on strategy and argument quality.

Please stop reading theory, especially disclosure theory, against debaters that are clearly less experienced than you. your speaks will suffer
