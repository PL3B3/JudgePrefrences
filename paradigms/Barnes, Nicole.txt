I consider these four things important in good debate: 

1)    Clash- I don’t care how you do it, with what arguments, etc. 

2)    Explanation- You need to explain how your argument (DA, CP, K, whatever) works in the debate- tell me what it does. I also expect explanation of how your arguments interact with each other AND with the opponent’s arguments (gets back to clash). 

3)    Impact analysis- End of the debate, how do your impacts stack up? Where do you stand, and why are your impacts more likely/ etc. than your opponents. 

4)    Respect- respect yourself and the other team- don’t make an ass out of yourself by being a jerk. 

On specifics: 

T: is a voter, spec arguments not so much. I don’t care if they let you run your agent CP or not: not my problem. 

Theory note: slow down here. 

CPs: conditional PICs kill debate. Make these arguments and the other team loses. Otherwise, as long as I know what it does, how it solves, and why it’s better, you’re in like flint. 

Das: I want a story, a link, an internal link (it’s sad that I have to specify this, but when they aren’t in the 1NC…) and an impact clear in the final speeches. 

Ks: Need to explain to me what you’re talking about and why I should care.
