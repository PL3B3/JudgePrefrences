  I debated at Chaparral High School in Las Vegas, NV, went to college at the Catholic University of America. I am finishing an MA at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in Journalism and Media Studies. I am employed full time as a public policy manager at the Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce. 

I consider myself to be an open minded judge. Feel encouraged to run whatever. 

I have no reservations about theory, though I think I don't find it especially interesting, and whether or not I believe in an RVI depends on in round argumentation made to that end. 

I prefer as a principle not to intervene, so it is very important that debaters give me a decision-making calculus if they want me to vote for them.

If you're speaking too quickly, I won't say clear, and I'll probably stop flowing and try to focus on listening. If you elect to go particularly fast, it is very important that you slow down for tags and other important parts of the flow so that I can organize it on the flow. I would say that going 80% of your fastest speed is important in front of me. I judge probably 20-30 rounds a year. 

I do this activity because I think it is fun and I've made a lot of friends in it. Please don't be too intense about the round (especially if you lose).
