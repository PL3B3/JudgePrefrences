  I'm a parent judge from Harrison, New York. I've judged at a few tournaments, so I consider myself a "trained newcomer." I appreciate a VERY, VERY slow, persuasive debate, with strong voting issues at the end. I want to see debaters make smart arguments and have strong closings, and I think the quality of your arguments matters more than the quantity. Please refrain from using any debate jargon, as I'm not familiar with it. I will award speaker points on a 25-30 scale, with a 27 being the average, and a 29 and higher reserved for only the best debaters.
