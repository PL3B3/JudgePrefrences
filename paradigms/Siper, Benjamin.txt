  Hello, I am Benjamin Siper. As of now I am at Cornell (2015), and three years removed from any debate whatsoever. This is the first result when one Googles my name, so I've removed much of my information. The chances of me judging again are slim, mostly because I could not flow fast while debating, and certainly have not kept up with debate since. If I do somehow make it back, email me at bds85@cornell.edu to get my judging prefs, with the subject line "Judging Prefs Request". Thank you and good luck!
