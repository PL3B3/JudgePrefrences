  Most of my experience is with LD. I have coached, judged and competed in this style for many years.

My favorite debate is where there is a clash of ideas from both sides and the winner is the one who makes the most compelling argument.

I look for a clean debate where both sides have a fair chance to win based on their arguments.

Make sure that you speak clearly. If I cannot understand what you are saying, then it will be as if I did not hear what you said. I will mention clear no more than twice.

Make sure that your arguments tie back to the topic, value and framework. I also want to hear about the impacts.

Your warrants must clearly support your position and refute your opponent. In other words, do not try to twist the warrant to justify your argument.

If your opponent is not following what I have mentioned above, it is your responsibility to point it out to me. If you do not, then I may not pick it up.

The technicalities that I have mentioned are to keep the debate fair. However, the most important thing for you to remember is that this is a debate and priority will be on the arguments you make.

I am okay with anything other when what I mentioned above, including counter plans, etc.

If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them before we start.
