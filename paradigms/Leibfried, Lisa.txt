  I am an assistant coach at Eastside Catholic (Sammamish, WA). I competed in LD for Sammamish High School (Bellevue, WA) 2010-2012 mostly on the WA circuit, and a couple national circuit tournaments.

My Ballot/Paradigm - Please explain to me what you are winning, why, and why it means you should win the round. All arguments will be evaluated through whichever framework is winning at the end of the round. It’s your job to do weighing, layering and explaining of impacts to me under the framework(s) and give a very clear impact calculus. There are no particular arguments I do not like to hear. I will never vote for a side with a thesis argument I don’t understand so feel free to use stories and analogies to help me understand. 

Speed/Clarity - Start slowly and build up speed so my ears can adjust. Slow down on tags and cards. Put space between a tag and a card. If you are too fast I will stop flowing. Please enunciate. Please signpost. Clarity must never be sacrificed for speed.

Extensions – Every single extension must have a clear warrant and impact!

Theory - This should only be used if there is extreme abuse. I’m not super well-versed in theory, so it might be in your best interest to avoid it. I would rather see substantive debates. If you are going to run theory, please don’t do it at lightening speed.

Cross-ex – I listen to cross like any other speech. Being intentionally unclear or rude during cross-ex will lower your speaks.

Critical arguments - This area is not my forte, meaning you will have to be extra clear and explain exactly how the argument functions in the round and what I should do with it.

Speaks - I look for things like clarity, persuasion, and composure. Speaks will go down for: being offensive/disrespectful/rude, being a jerk in cross-ex, and ignoring me after I call out “clear” twice. 

If there is anything you want more detail on or isn’t covered here, please ask me before round. Have fun J
