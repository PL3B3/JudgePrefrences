I have four years of experience with Lincoln-Douglas Debate, including a year of judging. I debated in the Texas Forensics Association as well as the National Forensics League. I am accustomed to different techniques of debate.
I will be flowing the rounds regardless of spreading speed. Spreading is acceptable. However, speed will not win the round. My vote will go to the side that best debates and upholds their value over the opposing side.
Theory debate can be as powerful as any other form of debate as long as it makes sense in reality.
