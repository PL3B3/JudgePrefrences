  I have three years of experience in high school policy debate, and two years of experience on the college circuit. Although I primarily come from a politics background, I can also appreciate a good K debate. I'm mostly looking for the impact calculus at the end of the round to sway my vote. Your rebuttals should really move the ballot in your favor; basically don't make me call for cards at the end of the round and reach my own conclusions. I'm also looking for coherent link stories - really sell me the narrative of your kritik/cp/da etc. If I don't see that your case can't reach their impacts, it will be much harder for me to vote on an unlikely scenario. In terms of logistics, I'm fine with speed as long as you can enunciate. Don't be rude during your cross examination. I will vote you down on speaker points for that reason alone. Evidence is not an end-all be-all for me. If your analysis of an argument is strong enough, I will consider it equally on the flow. 
Overall, play fair, be aggressive and articulate in your speech, and fill out my ballot for me. Make my job easy.
