  I have coached policy debate since 2010. I volunteer as a coach so don't travel or judge national tournaments often. I debated four years high school and four years college at A.S.U. (2X NDT qual'd, 1 Octa appearance). My job is a civil litigation attorney so basically a professional debater. As a judge, I think I'm tabula rasa. I don't have strong opinions about any particular argument or strategy. I base the decision on what I have on the flow. Arizona is a K-heavy circuit so I'm familiar with most of the Kritik literature. I start working on the topic during the summer and work with our teams all year so stay current with Affs, disads, t arguments, counterplans, Etc. My practice is to take any flash or email string the teams exchange so I can read what the debaters are reading. The reason I stay involved in policy debate is because I enjoy it, so I pay close attention in the round and work hard to make a good decision.
