  My goal is to be as tab as possible, so please do comparison so I don't have to intervene between arguments that conflict. I will vote for any argument that is won in the round and will judge each argument the same, but for speaker point purposes I prefer not to listen to pre-fiat args. I will only call for evidence/cases if there's a dispute about what it says. If I don't have your argument on my flow in the first speech, I won't flow it in later speeches, so please be clear if I say "clear" and slow down for card names and theory analytics.

To get high speaks: do good comparison and make good strategic choices

Ask me before the round if you have other questions.
