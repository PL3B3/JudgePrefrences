General:
-Slow down on tags, interps, plan/cp texts, and analytics.
-I have not heard a debate round in a while, so please do not start off at full speed.
-I will not vote on something that I do not understand, so please thoroughly explain if what you are reading is complicated.

Theory
-Run whatever theory you want. 

Policy Arguments
-Fun

Tricks
-Not the biggest fan. If you still decide to read them, make sure they have warrants, and are not one sentence long.

Philosophy
-I never read a lot of dense FW’s, so there is a good chance I will not be able to understand what you are talking about. If you explain it well, you should have no problem.

Kritiks
-Go for it.
-Make sure you read a ROB or FW of some kind and link offense back to it.

Dislocure
-I will vote for disclosure theory.
-Please disclose all broken positions on the NDCA wiki.
-The aff has to tell the neg what they are reading (advocacy texts, advantages) before the beginning of the round, unless it is a new aff.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me before the round starts.
