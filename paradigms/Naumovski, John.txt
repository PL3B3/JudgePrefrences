  I'm conflicted to MVLA. But, this is my first time judging, and I have no prior debate experience, so keep these things in mind. 

Please don't run theory. I'll have no idea how to evaluate it, so it will only confuse me.

I appreciate a debate of the topic. Simpler philosophies are fine, but more complex ones will be very difficult for me to evaluate. Please also explain your arguments very well, otherwise I won't be very partial to them. On the contention level, please have plausible arguments. I don't find arguments like "the topic leads to nuke war, nuke war causes extinction" to be very plausible, so I won't find it as a persuasive argument.

I enjoy good clash, so please do very clear weighing.

Fast speech needs to be understandable, so please do not go much faster than conversational pace. No "spreading" please. Also, please have some perceptual dominance (don't go overboard with it), as looking like you know you have lost isn't very persuasive.

Lastly, please don't press me on the decision - I have no experience, and I can't change the ballot.
