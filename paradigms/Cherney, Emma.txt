  My name is Emma Cherney and I am a debate judge. 

I have been judging debate for four years and have experience with both PF and LD styles of debate. I do not have any preference as to which style you use to debate.
I am comfortable with speed, however if you do use speed be sure to use the entirety of the allotted time.
