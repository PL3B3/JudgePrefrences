  My name is Mark Ochweri and in all honesty I am a simple judge; in my time debating on the JV and Novice level for Binghamton University I have encountered most if not all types of arguments therefore I will be able to follow you on the aff or neg where ever you go. To receive a winning ballot it is very important that you focus not only on running good arguments but also articulating those arguments in a manner in which I can understand your position even if I was a kindergarten student or Taylor Swift. I will vote on condo and other theory arguments if the implications of these arguments are clearly outlined EVEN IF ITS DROPPED ITS NOT AN AUTO WIN, but I will give you a lot of leeway, despite that the appropriate work must be done. In terms of Kritiks please don't simply say generic link stories and simple buzz words, lay down the K in clear and relevant terms with regards to the debate round; all in all, do what you do best in front of me and remember to have F.U.N.
