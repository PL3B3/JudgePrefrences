CheryPotts, Speech and Debate coach at Plano Senior HS for 13 years

I prefer philosophy based arguments in LD, but I am becoming more open to kritiks as I feel that kritiks offer a philosophical bent to the debate. I don't like to hear a lot of preemptive arguments in the AC, and I don't like speed reading as a delivery style. I like to hear clash, voters, big picture summaries, real world applications, all without a lot of jargon. I really don't think people should have to be specialized LD judges in order to evaluate this kind of debate.
