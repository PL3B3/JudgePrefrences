  I am the High School debate coach at Korea International School. I have previously coached in Washington State where I was HS Debate Coach at Anacortes High School for 6 years. 

I enjoy clash and like to see that competitors listen carefully to their opponent’s arguments before effectively rebutting. I find repetition and pre-canned responses annoying. 

My preferred debate style is Lincoln Douglas, and I love the art of rhetoric. I want to be persuaded and will tend to lend more credence to those arguments which are effectively communicated. I appreciate philosophical evidence and enjoy watching debaters who can effectively apply age-old philosophical currents to the resolution and debate at hand. I do not find it necessary to completely “cover the flow” in the 1AR, but feel that the most important arguments on the table need to be addressed. I appreciate very much a debater who can crystalize the most essential arguments, and who has the ability to combine, group, and apply arguments for effective rebuttals. Please explain your positions well. Do not use a lot of jargon and lean toward more explanation rather than less.

In the case of Policy and Public Forum debate, I want to know where the evidence is coming from and that it is solid. No warrant or weak warrant = no argument. Having said that, this needs to be pointed out by the opposing side. Some speed is OK as long as it is enunciated clearly enough to be understood. Don’t overdo it. 

I appreciate civility and have the expectation that both message and tone will be respectful.
