Both speakers bear the burden of their respective positions in rebuttals. Each must address their opponent's position in the debate.
All arguments a speaker intends to stand on must be introduced in the first speech that is made.

Constructive/Rebuttals: All arguments a debater intends to stand on should be introduced as constructives. Rebuttals are used to expand and extend issues which the speaker has previously introduced. No new arguments should be introduced in rebuttals. New arguments issued in rebuttals are to be disregarded except when they are being used to buttress positions which were previously introduced in constructives.
Decision: Since it is not possible to prove a value, I choose to award the winner as the individual who best upholds their side of the resolution through effective analysis, evidence reasoning, refutation, and delivery. The key for me is debate, logic and persuasion. Of course, the debaters are still required to use ample and proper evidence in supporting assertions of fact.
