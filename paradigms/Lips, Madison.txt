  I debated LD and PF in high school for three years at the local, state, and national levels. I am currently an English major at Yale University. 

My focus as a judge in LD is on the value and criterion. Prove to me that your value is better achieved and more relevant to the topic than your opponent's. I do like to see evidence to back up your claims as well, but I'd give the win to someone who focuses more on winning the big ideas and the philosophy of the round than on facts. For that reason, I don't like speed--I want to hear your arguments developed, not random information spat at me. Also, make sure you understand the philosophy you're using. Other than that just be courteous--I don't like catty debates!
