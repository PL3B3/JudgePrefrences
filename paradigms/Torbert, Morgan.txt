  Debated Policy for West Des Moines Valley until I graduated in 2013. I have judged sporadically in Texas since then. Judged in both novice policy and novice LD.

St Marks will be my first tournament on this topic. As of now I am not familiar with the resolution, so be really clear about that and your plan as AFF.

Be Clear: I will interrupt and say clear if I can't understand you. I'd rather you be clear than fast

Roadmap: Please roadmap before and during your speeches. I can't read your minds

Theory: I HATE BLIPY 1 LINE THEORY ARGUMENTS. Don't run them in front of me. IF you see a true violation, run theory or T, but I want it fleshed out. No reading your generic Theory block files. 

This one is the most important. 

Debate is supposed to be fun for everyone! BE NICE, TREAT YOUR OPPONENTS and YOUR JUDGES (not just me) with respect!
