  As with most judges, I value clear, well-reasoned arguments with a definitive value and criterion and an effective counter to opponent's arguments. 

Speed is not of concern unless the speaker is not clear. 

Quality is valued over quantity. A single well argued point is more effective that several weak ones. 

Specific, in-depth arguments are likely to be effective.
