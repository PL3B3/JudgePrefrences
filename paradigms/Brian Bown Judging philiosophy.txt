  I have been coaching Policy for many years. I love games playing, speed, hate Kritiks but won't critisize or descriminate against you for running them. I just don't understand why you argue the legitimacy of the topic. But, done well I will vote for you. But a good T against it I will consider.
Speed must be done well and I can flow it. But if you are sloppy I will say clear once. If I have to say it a second time I will stop flowing.
