Conflicts: [1] Dallastown [2] Loyola Blakefield

Background: I debated 1 year PF and 3 years LD.

Voting: I vote on the flow + argument clash. If you want me to know that something is bullshit, say so.

Preferences: Run anything. I only ask for three things:
Nice: Don't emotionally or physically harm anyone in the room.Real: No frivolous or malicious theory/spikes/etc. Please. I'll flow it and I'll judge it but I'll hate it. (If the goal is to win on the theory instead of the substance, I hate it.)Fair: The debate is fair & interesting. That's a bit nebulous; it boils down to the idea that debaters who go to camp shouldn't autobeat debaters who didn't, just because they didn't go to camp. Example of an unfair & uninteresting debate: debater A runs traditional, debater B runs a K, debater B argues that they operate at a higher level and so they win; done. Example of a fair & interesting debate: debater A runs traditional, debater B runs a K, debater B argues that they operate at a higher level AND that debater A's moral framework is insufficient AND that debater A's impacts don't matter / flow to B / etc. AND so they win.
Debates types I enjoy the most: good util > good FW = good post-fiat K > good pre-fiat K > good performance > good theory
