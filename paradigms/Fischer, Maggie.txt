  I am very much a flow judge. However, I refuse to fill in the blanks for competitors. Something must be said in the round for me to consider it in my decision. I debated PF for four years and qualified for nationals once. In PF specifically, I prefer to see clash between the competitors and evidence used for every claim. Generally speaking, I use evidence as a major factor in my decision. Again, I only vote on what is expressly said in the round, so presenting the facts and statistics supporting a claim is extremely important to me.
