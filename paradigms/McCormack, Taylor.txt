  I debated for Monticello High School in New York for four years, from 2009-2013, mostly doing PF and LD. I currently attend Rollins College where I'm majoring in International Business and English. Though I most likely won't be judging a ton, I figured this should be posted if I do.

Yes, Daniel is my father and Meaghan is my sister. If you'd like a more in-depth understanding of my judging paradigm, look at their Wikis.

This will be really brief, as I imagine most debaters read these quickly before rounds like I did. 

I like: unique but logical arguments, funny people, and food.
I dislike: speed, rude people, and illogical/unsupported arguments.

Have fun and good luck!
