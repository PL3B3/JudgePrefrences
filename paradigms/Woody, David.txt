Number of years judging experience: 1

My preferences are simple: 

1. Cross-ex is for the students to learn more about each other's arguments, not for them to sway my decision. I will never base my decision on anything that happened during cross-ex.

2. A common sense argument, well-stated, is always, always more compelling to me than sophistry, tricks, and technicalities.

3. Please try to slow down for the tag lines. If there are warrants, and you want me to vote based on them, make sure I can hear them.
