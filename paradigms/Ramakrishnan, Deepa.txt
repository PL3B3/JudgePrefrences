  I debated for three years at the Harker School in California and traveled primarily on the national circuit. I graduated in 2008 and now attend the University of Chicago.
I'm fine with any type of argumentation as long as there are warrants and clear impacts. I will vote off theory if clear abuse is demonstrated, and will probably give you low speaks if theory is run just as an easy way out of the round. Make sure a clear standard/burden/way to evaluate the round is articulated. Make good and smart arguments and you will get high speaks.
