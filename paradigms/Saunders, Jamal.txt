  I did debate a bit in middle school but am getting back to the high school circuit this year. I am fairly new to the topic, but know enough of the story to follow a debate. I have judged a few debates on the topic this year at national tournaments and am looking forward to seeing more complex argumentation around the topic.
I am not great with speed so make sure that you are clear and loud when reading. If I don’t hear the argument, I can’t flow the argument.
Abusive arguments must be clearly weighed on the flow. I’m pretty new to the more detailed arguments so clear analysis is very necessary. Don’t assume I know the link, it must be clearly articulated.
Speaker points have to be earned and the only thing assumed when starting is a fiat framework, any other story will have to be clearly articulated.
