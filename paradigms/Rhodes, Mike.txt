  I am a retired speech and debate coach from Rains ISD. This is my first year of retirement.

A fast rate of speech is okay, but make sure it is audible and that I can clearly follow your flow. Be careful not to cross the line between inappropriately rude and light sarcasm/wit. I like to hear substantive debate on the topic and not just excessive framework, theory, claims of abuse, etc. 

Your closing speeches, which should include your voters, carry a substantial amount in weight with the ballot. This is your last chance to prove your key arguments and it should be very calculated and strategic. 

Evidence and data are very important in the round and should be used in support for all of your contentions. 

CX is your greatest opportunity to gain the upper hand and the better debater will likely emerge as superior in CX... so make the best of your CX time!
