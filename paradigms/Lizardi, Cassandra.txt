  2nd year out from Law Magnet coached by Kris Wright (if that has any implication lol) instructor at TDC. 3 years of LD and 1 year of CX.. I just want an argument and its in round implications clearly explained to me. I don't like frivolous theory but I'll vote on it if I have to. Given my apprehension to theory I'm probably more willing to grant an RVI. If you're gonna try to question whether racism actually exists, or argue that it may be good prob not gonna win my ballot. Most of my judging experience is with novice debate so I haven't formed too many crazy debate opinions yet, just want everyone to get the most out of debate!
