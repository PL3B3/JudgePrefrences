Debated: Lowell High School ‘15
Currently a 2nd year at UCSB
Short Version:
Read whatever arguments you are most comfortable with/think are most strategic, I’m fine with pretty much anything. Tech over truth in most cases. Speed is fine, but be clear. Warrants, clash, framing and impact calc are all appreciated. The debate is about you, not me, so do what you do best. Having said that, if you’d like some specific insights into how I evaluate rounds, continue reading.
If it helps to know what args I went for as a 2N in high school, you can check out my old wiki. *Disclaimer: don’t go for arguments you think I will like, just do you. But if it helps…

For the China topic:
Cal will be the first tournament I judge on this topic. Just keep in mind that things like core of the topic or limits arguments on T may not be as intuitive for me as they are for you. Also, don’t assume I am familiar with topic specific acronyms or jargon.
Some specific things
Ks/K affs:
- Framing is important. I’m perfectly fine with “non-traditional”/kritikal affs, but I have to understand what I’m voting for and why I’m voting for it.- I have a basic understanding of most critical theory but don’t assume I’m familiar with the nuances of more obscure or specific literature. Having said that, if you’re debating the K successfully, I shouldn’t need to have any prior knowledge.DAs
- The more specific the better- Impact calc and turns case arguments are appreciated CPs
- I generally think CPs should compete functionally and textually but I can be persuaded otherwise- Well researched, advantage CPs were some of my favorites arguments to read in HST
- I default to competing interpretations unless told otherwise- The impact debate is important. “The aff explodes limits” is not an inherent impact.Theory
- Generally, a reason to reject the argument, not the team, but I can be persuaded to pull the trigger on theory if you give me a compelling reason to. Misc
- I love a good case debate- I will always be impressed by a strategically utilized CX- Flashing =/= prep- Have fun, be nice
