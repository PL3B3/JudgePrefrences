I debated in policy debate for four years in high school, and I am currently in my second year of NPDA in the college circuit.

I am perfectly fine with speed as long as there is clarity. Tag teaming is fine as long as you don't steamroll your partner. A little bit of sass is great, I think it's part of developing clash. Just don't go overboard and make the round full of rude and petty attacks, that bugs me and ruins the round.

I will judge the round based on how you frame it. I am personally a huge fan of nontraditional arguments, I think it's a good thing to break out of comfort zones and talk about some of the deeper issues of society. If you choose a K debate, I will look at who has better defended framework or net benefits, depending on how you tell me to judge the round. I am also more likely to buy your K if you have specific link stories, none of the typical generic stuff I have seen floating around. For a straight up debate, I will look at who has better warranted out and defended impacts. I'm really open to all kinds of arguments, I just want to see that you know what you're doing. Warrants are necessary for me to consider any claim, even when you are only extending an argument. I'll need you to let me know why the extension applies specifically.
