  - i am not good at flowing. don't go crazy fast. pretty fast is cool. sign-post well and organize your cases in an easy-to-flow manner.
- i like to vote on topical arguments. i think that the topic can be engaged in many different ways.
- theory nowadays is mostly frivolous. i will still vote on it, but running theory when there is not clear abuse will jeopardize your speaks
- i like big picture crystallization. i hate having to piece together compartmentalized parts of the flow to construct a ballot story for a debater. tell me what arguments or issues are important in the debate, explain why you're winning them, explain how that all adds up to a ballot for you. 
- when in question, over explain rather than under explain.
- if the debate is super fast and there are tons of analytics, chances are i have no idea what's going on, please slow down.
