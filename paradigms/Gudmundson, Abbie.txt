  My name is Abbie Gudmundson, I debated for four years at Lakeville South and coached there for two years, though I am currently not coaching.

Overall, I consider myself a more traditional judge, as this was my debate style. I prefer a debate that is concentrated on the standards, and truly uses it as a filter for other arguments in the round. As such, I am more impressed with debaters who invest in their arguments and develop them into well-thought out voting issues at the end of the round. Weighing arguments is a great way to persuade me; not simply saying that you outweigh but pointing out which specific arguments of your opponents you are mitigating.

If you have any other questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Abbie
