  Varsity JudgeI flow arguments very well.Timing is very important. Please start and finish within the time given.Off- Time Road Maps are unnecessary to me.I am open to any arguments as long as they are well argued and linked to something that has impact.I understand the need to cram necessary evidence/ reasons in the argument so individuals who speak fast are fine with me. Speed is definitely not a problem to me.Make sure contentions are clear and well thought out.
