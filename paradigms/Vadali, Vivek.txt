  In high school, i was mostly a congress, extemp, and pfd debater, although occasionally i would dabble in ld. I have experience judging ld for the past four years though, so i know what to expect, what works and what doesn't, and how to critique. 

That being said, the closest paradigm i can come close to using to describe my preference is tabula rasa. I know how banal that phrase has become over the years, but i'll vote on anything that contains a logical, coherent, and cohesive structure/flow (without being abusive). It's best to ask me specific questions before the db8 starts though, tbh.
