  This is my 5th year debating in policy. I debated for Eagle and now I am a Freshman at ISU debating for them. You may consider me a tabs judge: the round is yours to do what you wish with. I tend to, however, have a much higher threshold for T, ASPEC, and performatives. If you run T, make sure the affirmative is fairly untopical or run it as a double bind. Any arguments run should be strategic in order to win the ballot. I am a K debater and absolutely love the K. That being said, if you choose to go kritikal (no matter the side) make sure you understand your kritisism. I am fine with speed; spread don't spew. I follow the flow so don't drop things! That makes me sad. FW debates are great. Turns are great. Double binds are great. Specific warrant analysis is great. Humor is great. Diverse args are great. Ptix is great. Whatever you run, run it well. Debates are meant to be educational; have fun and learn something.
