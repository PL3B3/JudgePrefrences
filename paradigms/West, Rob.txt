  I debated in high school ('97-'00), and have judged from time to time since. I am open to evaluating any argument as long as it is clearly articulated and well developed. I'll vote on anything with the largest impact/strongest link, but don't rely on me to assess these things at the end. I try really hard to only evaluate what's on my flow, so don't expect me to give you the benefit of the doubt on something that you implied. These are the first debates that I have judged on this year's topic, so please refrain from using acronyms that I wouldn't understand, and don't assume that I have a great background knowledge about the resolution. Please make sure that your last speeches are crystal clear, and help to prioritize the issues that I should decide the debate on.

Have fun and please respect each other!
