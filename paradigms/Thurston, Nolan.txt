  I'm not particularly picky about content or delivery - run whatever you like however you like. I don't study the sorts of things you might like to run, so do be sure to explain it to me. I am comfortable with speed, but can only write so quickly. I will complain if you get going too quickly.

If you have specific questions, feel free to ask me before round or email me at nolthur@gmail.com

Background:
I am a senior electrical engineering major at UNL. I debated for four years in high school and have been judging LD since I graduated in 2014.
