  I have 3 years of experience debating VLD and I am currently studying business and politics at the University of San Francisco.

I assign speaker points based on performance. I love to watch an aggressive debate but don't be catty or rude. Also please keep your volume at a reasonable level, there's no need to shout.

On spreading: I am a good flow judge and can handle speed but if you're speaking too quickly or unclearly I will call "slow" or "clear" more than a few times and then you're on you're own.

Don't waste your speech time on explaining rules that your opponent has broken, (bringing in new arguments, not being true to the topic blah blah blah) say it briefly if you feel you must but 9 times out of 10 I've already recognized it and nullified it within the debate.

I'm never going to make arguments for you so even if I believe you have the better framework and case, if you don't extend arguments across the flow, there's a good chance you won't pick up.

I am comfortable judging anything you want to put on the flow as long as it's quality. I like a good topicality debate more than the average judge but there still needs to be a decent amount of clash to win the debate. Disads, plans and counter-plans are fine. Run a Kritik if you wish, but make sure it's executed flawlessly.

To me, the debate is about framework. I don't want to vote on who has better cards, I want to vote on standards, values and impacts. Tell me why I should prefer your world to your opponents world. Last speeches should end with voters issues and while you can obviously list however many voters you want, I would recommend keeping it to 3-6 strong ones. Anymore than that and they're just blippy arguments and not sufficient reasons to vote either way.

That being said, no matter what my preferences, if you run a solid case, I don't care what you run. I like to see debaters have a good time and challenge one another and that's all that really matters.
