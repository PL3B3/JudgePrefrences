  Topicality isn't something I'd usually vote for. A win on topicality isn't usually an interesting debate.


I like disads since they tend to steer the debate to better places

Counter plans are fine, I think they make for pretty interesting debates 

I don't like K's.

For neg, your links shouldn't just be generic links, try and explain why they specifically link to what the aff has said. 

for aff, your case probably has huge impacts, I like hearing case defense to give access to those impacts
