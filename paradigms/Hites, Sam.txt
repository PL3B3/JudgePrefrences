  Hello!
Debate Experience: I debated for West Des Moines Valley while I was in high school as a 2N competing in policy, I now debate for the University of northern Iowa.

I'd like to stress the fact that I am OK with debaters arguing about what they like,YOU DO YOU! My role as the judge is to evaluate the debate based on the arguments you will present to me. I will try my hardest to keep my own preferences out of debates that I am judging.

My favorite kind of debates to watch: A good CP/DA debate VS an aff that does something.
What you shouldn't read in front of me: Offensive arguments, That is pretty much it.

I would like it it be noted that while I am ok with judging just about anything, I am not too well read on alot of the Kritik lit. so really explain your K to me if its not a common Kritik read.

Other Things worth Noting: I'm a sucker for reasonability, Condo is probably good, I LOVE PICS, I read topical affirmatives, I typically read CP/DA strats on the Neg. Also if you can make me laugh sometime during your debate, I will boost your speaks.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round as well
