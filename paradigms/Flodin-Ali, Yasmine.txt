  I debated for four years in high school.

I haven’t judged much on this topic so don’t assume that I know every little acronym. However having debated for four years I am familiar with a variety of arguments and am open to pretty much everything. 

Please only spread as fast as you can speak clearly – speed is fine but I would rather hear you speak slowly and eloquently than quickly and incoherently. 

I’m not a huge fan of T, though I will vote for it if the violation is well argued and you can prove in-round abuse. 

Disads are fine but explain the link story in detail, without a well articulated story your impact calculus has little weight.

I’m a huge fan of kiritks, but please do the work and make your shell relevant to the round you’re in. ie specific links, interact with the 1ac, and explain how your alternative functions within the round. 

I’ll vote on theory only if you go for it fully in your last speech, or at least spend a significant amount of time on it, a 30 second blip probably won’t do much for you. I hate theory debates where each side just reads pre-written blocks and never addresses the others standards. So if you’re going to center the debate around theory arguments please show a little clash. 

Basically the round is what you make it, tell me what to vote for and why. I don’t want to have to sit and think about which flow is the most important at the end of the round, I’d like it to be clear what you’re going for.

I view debate as an alternative educational space, with this in mind tell me as a judge why I should value certain arguments above others. I really do believe that through debating we determine the nature of this activity, so I am partial to arguments that relate back to setting standards within our debate community not just in the world where policies are passed (though I will of course evaluate the round under that mindset if convinced to do so).
