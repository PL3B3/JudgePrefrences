  Paradigm for Bat-ami Katzman
I'm a hired judge who is a current student at MIT. I am a former policy and LD debater so I can listen to essentially any argument. I want to see a good debate - if you're going to speak with speed in LD, make sure you're clear and can articulate, and make sure it's not full on policy spreading. I will flow everything and judge what's presented to me, but make sure whatever you debate, you debate it well.
