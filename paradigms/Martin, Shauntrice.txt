  Sheppard Square is where it started departed from broken hearts
Locked and loaded for defeat, retreated from the start
Tainted by my environment, I signed the application
Initially giving my soul away to assimilation
But now I am BACK
And I am a Black Panther after backstabbers and dream snatchers
Watch your back, Im coming to catch you
I aint humming soft no more, I'm hitting you hardcore
With my dark complexion and re-direction
If you don't extend the arguments, plan on softening my erection
Slide up in my intersection
You probably take me literal, but listen for a while
I'm down for penetration of the mind, I wanna ride unique styles.

I debated for the University of Louisville in open division for two years. My partner and I (Deven Cooper) attained 3rd place in ADA Nationals. I have judged middle school, high school, and college tournaments. I currently coach debate at Collington Elementary and Baltimore Freedom Academy and coached for Towson University last year. I have judged 25 rounds on the topic this year and have been a high school judge for about three years. I have coached/judged in Kentucky, California, DC, New York and Maryland.

I am very open to different forms of debate. The most important things are:
1. personal connection to the topic/creativity
2. evidence to validate your claims
3. respect
4. impact analysis/ballot discussion in your rebuttals

These are all equally important to me. A debater who wants higher speaker point will be prepared, convincing, demonstrate excellent communication skills, and creative.

If you argue abuse, topicality, or any other traditional block args, you need to relate it specifically to what the other teams has done IN ROUND. I don't want a lot of hypotheticals and hyperbole. If you are a "K" team, the same thing applies.
