  I just graduated in 2011 and had done debate for 3 years. 1 year, I did speaking events, one doing LD, and one doing PFD and LD both.

My preferences for LD? I'm most familiar with traditional v/c, however feel free to run anything on one note: It has to have purpose in the round. Silly observations, off cases, ect., aren't appreciated. Doesn't mean you can't run them, just make sure it has purpose. If not, it's a waste of my time and your opponents time. We're all here for the same reason: To have fun. Don't ruin it.

Also, if you do run anything really wacky, just make sure to sign post. As long as you tell me where your going, I can keep up.

As far as what matters the most in the round, it can change depending on the debate. However, it does help as the judge to hear impacts, weighing, and most importantly: voters. If nothing else, tell me why you won the round.

And finally, spreading. Spreading has always annoyed me, however I have heard good spread and don't mind spreading as long as its good. Meaning? Its clear. If you have anything keeping you from spreading clearly (not enunciating clearly, a different accent, braces, anything really), then don't do it.

So, summary? Sign post, and do your job as a debater correctly, and I don't have a problem with you running most of anything. Thanks!
