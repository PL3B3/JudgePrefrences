  I debated Public Forum and LD at Strake Jesuit and graduated in 2012. I have been almost completely detached from the activity since my graduation except for a few emails here and there and a camp for novices over the summer.

For the debate, clarity is key. If you can go fast and be clear that is fine, but if you can’t be clear then don’t spread. If I can’t understand you I won’t flow the argument.
I will vote for arguments that make sense to me (so warrant them well) and are cleanly extended (claim warrant and impact (this includes weighing)). I predominantly did PF during my time and high school and I am not as well versed in the nuances of LD strategy as I once was. This means that if your case is dense and has game over a priori framework arguments (or anything very technically savvy) and you want to go for them, make them explicit in your speeches because I will be more than happy to vote on them if you win them. 

On a final note, please be polite to your opponent. If you are rude to your opponent, I will give you very low speaker points (especially if it is very clear that you are winning the round and everyone knows it).

Before the round if you have any specific questions I will be more than happy to answer them.

Good luck and have fun!
