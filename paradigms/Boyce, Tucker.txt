  Background
Sophomore (and actively debating) at the University of Georgia
Alpharetta (GA) '13 - 4 years debate, TOC 2013

Rounds
Varsity Rounds Judged, Latin America Topic: 45
Oceans Topic Rounds: 36 -- (including at the Emory and Northwestern camps). Pretty familiar with the topic.
Constraints: Alpharetta HS, Cambridge HS

The really quick version: You should read arguments you're most comfortable with and feel free to debate in whatever style you like, just do it well. Aff and strategy choice matter much less than the skills you use to execute arguments. Trickery and sketchiness are never a replacement for good strategy and coherent argumentation, no matter what arguments you choose to read.

The quick version:
1. Be Nice - this is really important to me - high school debate is a community because of the great people in it, and you should reflect that in how you carry yourself in and outside of debates. Being slightly aggressive about arguments and in CX is fine, there's a line.
2. Debate how you want to debate - it doesn't matter what the arguments are, what matters is how you frame them and explain them. As a judge I believe my job is to evaluate the arguments debaters would like to discuss. I try to be as clean-slate as possible, with some specific preferences discussed below.
3. Framing is key - creative and concise 2NR/2AR framings will be rewarded. Clear explanations and comparisons are necessary. The best rebuttals go beyond simple impact calc and form a more cohesive strategic approach.
4. Explanation is often more important than what the card says - what matters is how you explain it and compare the evidence. I'm less likely to call for cards if the 2NR/2AR explanation is just a tag. If I deem that evidence does need to be called, then I'm going to give more weight to the arguments actually made during the speech on that particular part of the debate. I'm not a fan of calling up tons of evidence and reading into it more than was done in the speeches.
5. Be interesting - I believe the best debaters have developed a sense of what they're good at, no matter what that is, and use it to their advantage.
6. Flashing - I won't take prep for flashing, but please be reasonable.

Marking Evidence:
If you mark a card during a speech, you need to physically mark it in the document. You should have a marked version available if the opponent requests.If I call up evidence, please check to see that you have marked it appropriately in the document you give to me. If I end up calling up a card and have written on my flow that it was marked, and you did not mark it, I will subtract speaker points from the speaker who read the card.

DA:
- Always a fan. A good agenda politics throwdown is one of my favorite types of rounds (if it's good at the tournament), but if that's not your thing, that's fine too.
- Clear impact comparison, DA interaction with the case, and 'link controls' or 'uniqueness controls' all should be explained in the context of the round and not generically- Ideal Neg blocks should indict 2AC evidence on multiple levels
- I prefer the impact calc/overview at the top of the flow. I don't think the trend of doing it elsewhere is good for the structure of debating. You should answer the impact defense on the line by line as normal.

CP:
- Well-written and specific CP's are great. The more theoretically questionable the CP is, the better the solvency advocate should be. Affs should utilize theory against CP's that do the whole Aff with specific abuse claims.
- Explain what sufficiency vs. necessary framing etc. are in the context of the round.
- I will not "Judge-Kick" the Counterplan for the Negative unless:
A.) It is specifically said and justified - but that does not mean saying "you can kick this if you don't like it"
B.) There is comparative impact analysis on this question of the debate

K:
- I'm relatively familiar with a range of K's - specific link work is a must, and it's great if you could link cards in the 1AC or specific actions of the Aff within the K. You should contextualize your more generic arguments to the Affirmative to get a better explanation. I'm not as familiar with Baudrillard and post-modernism arguments so those will need more explanation.
- Framing is really important here - don't just go for a bunch of tricks, tell me what they all mean in context of the Aff.- On the Aff, it is important to think of the broader 2AR strategy vs. the K rather than a collection of loosely connected arguments. I find that often the 1AR extends many arguments without development rather than developing a cohesive 2AR set-up - this can be changed by planning the overall strategy vs. the K before the 1AR even starts.

Case: Love well-developed case debates. 

The Neg increasingly just reads impact defense now. It's so much more than that - multiple levels of defense, indicts of 1AC evidence, re-reading of their evidence, and recent evidence will be rewarded. I will reward Neg blocks that spend a lot of time on case defense. 1AR's should collapse down in these scenarios to extend and explain their best offense. Affs that are able to articulate cohesive warrants in response to impact defense arguments. The Aff should use CX to point out the generic nature of their arguments if the Neg is just reading impact defense.

Non-Traditional Arguments:
- Fine with all of them, although if I had a favorite type of these, it's Affs that have a stronger connection to oceans/ocean policy/the topic broadly.
- Comparisons are key, couching your arguments in the method and framing of your opponent's. The role of the ballot and the impacts need to be explained in context of the debate.
- Even though I'm familiar with many of these arguments, I am not well-versed in the books and literature on many of these topics, so explanation of more complex arguments is important. As long as the explanation is clear and complex topics are explained sufficiently, it is fine.

 T:
- Evidence comparison and precision arguments are under-utilized
- The Aff should have unique offense and try to provide examples of various Affs that do and don't fit their interp. 1AR/2AR has to isolate that offense and impact it.
- Well-impacted rebuttals are key, including comparison of offense and not just generic "limits! fairness!" discussion

Framework:
- Again, I'm fine with anything executed well. I judge framework debates based on technical arguments and framing that happened in the debate.
- Is framework a viable 2NR in front of me? Yes, definitely, as long as you debate it well (just like anything else). Is going for impact turns vs. framework on the Aff viable? Yes, of course.
- Aff-specific: Clear impact calculus and interaction of arguments with the content of the Affirmative vs. Framework is also important, especially when going for "Aff outweighs" style of arguments
- Neg-specific: Generic block-reading is not persuasive; framework should be contextualized to the specifics of the Aff, and you should use clear examples, grounding impact claims with anticipation of the Aff's final offense.

Theory:
- There needs to be a clear impact and abuse story if it's an issue to reject the team.
- Perm theory and blippy 2AC arguments probably aren't reasons to reject the team, but could be argued as such hypothetically with an abuse story
.- In order for it to be an argument, it must have a warrant when it is introduced.
- Even though I love the Politics DA, well-developed politics theory debating by the Aff is viable
- Condo needs to be well-warranted in the 1AR to set up 2AR offense properly, otherwise I'm likely to dismiss brand new arguments.

Points: Obviously good execution of arguments/impact calculus/structure are most important for speaks. Other things are also important, like being nice, having a unique style, executing one area of argumentation particularly well, etc.
Unnecessary trickery and sketchiness in argumentation, whether it's spiking out of offense that actually links, excessive blippy theory arguments, etc. will negatively effect points.
If you think you flowed well, show me your flows once the 2AR ends, and if I agree, I'll add up to .3 speaker points. Obviously the 1N doesn't need a flow of the 2NC and stuff like that.

Scale
26-27.5 = large errors or need for improvement in most areas
27.6-28 = alright overall, but consistent errors in certain areas
28.2 = About average for me calculating speaks I gave in varsity last year
28.1-28.3 = good debating but little excellent moments and some small errors. 
28.4-28.5 = overall solid, good moments, close to breaking normally
28.6-29 = great debating with some moments of excellent style/etc, probably a team that can break at the tournament
29-29.3 = very impressive speeches deserving of a speaker award in a Quarters Bid quality pool.
29.4-29.5 = best or one of the best speeches I'll hear in a season
29.6-30 = near perfection
I will assign a 0 for a debater proven to be clipping cards or in violation of some other ethics rule. If you believe that your opponent has clipped evidence, you need to provide me with a recording of the speech for review. The debate will be stopped, and it is all-or-nothing because it is a serious ethics challenge. If needed, consultation with the tab room for specific tournament rules will take place, but there must be a recording.

Ocean Topic Thoughts
- I will enjoy well-debated Arctic arguments and will probably talk to you in-depth about it in the post-round.
- T debates, especially with T-Seabed, should isolate more unique offense to both sides.
- International CP debates should include more analysis and specificity on what type of options and tech countries have. Simply saying "extend that Japanese tech fails" isn't the best.

CX
I often flow CX to record finer details and distinctions with certain types of arguments. Please use time asking focused, narrow strategic questions rather than just a list of "point me a line..." kind of questions.

Things you should never say:- 
“If you make that argument in your speech we’ll answer it.” – just answer the question
- “You should call this up!” and all variations of that – explain the evidence; I'll call evidence up if needed but you don't need to tell me
- "Why should the judge vote aff" in 1AC CX - confusion/generic
- "We'll win this...." - explain why- "Perm do the plan and the non-mutually exclusive parts of the Alt" - this does not mean anything unless you permute a specific part of the Alt. In fact, this perm actually is literally the definition of a perm, at which point saying "Perm Perm!" would be the same. It's the equivalent of saying "No Link - the link to the DA is not a link".

Things you should never do:
- Be mean to your partner, the other team, people in general, etc.
- Mis-pronounce "Boehner" haha
- Waive CX
- Indicate that you're not confident in your partner - always support them!
- Lie about something in CX - if you're genuinely unsure about something, just ask me and I'll nod or something - that's way better than saying you didn't read a theory argument when you did.
- Make distasteful jokes. Jokes are really cool, but there's a line.

Good luck!
