  LD: 
In LD I like to see well warranted arguments. I also like to see more discourse and in detail analysis and examination of opponents arguments and rhetoric. If you are going for philosophical arguments be sure to explain more than just what it is but its application in the round and why and how it needs to be evaluated by me. I am ok with speed, however, know that this is LD and speed isnt its intent. I am open to any argumentation that you like to read. I will not vote on Rape good, Racism good, etc arguments. 


CX; 

 I will not restrict what you choose to perform. Ks are great. You have to actually win the K for me to vote. Reading it isnt enough. Be sure that you know the arguments that you want to run. Dont run it, just to run it. I am fine with speed, dont let that hurt clarity. Dont steal prep! I do not evaluate CX unless it is brought up in the next speech. I like clash. Impact calculus will take teams a long way. I will not do work for you to make the decision, if I do, it will be reflected in speaker points. I will not vote on "rape good" Racism good" claims.
