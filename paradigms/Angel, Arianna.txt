  My name is Arianna Angel. I debated for four years at South East High School. I am now LAMDL alumni, and I am attending UC Berkeley. I won't vote on Topicality, unless the team can prove that there really is abuse that doesn't allow the debate round to proceed fairly. I vote on Ks only when they are explained thoroughly and are made 100% relevant to the affirmative case. Ks have to make the affirmative plan seem like the worst idea possible. I will try to enter the debate round as a blank slate, and base my decision only on the arguments made within the rounds. At the end of the round I will only vote affirmative if that team has proven that the affirmative is the best policy to endorse. The affirmative must present a policy that can be evaluated in a political framework and the negative has to demonstrate why the affirmative is a bad idea, or offer a counter plan. I am ok with spreading as long as I can understand the speaker; I cannot judge what I cannot understand. I need students to enunciate.
