  I dont like speed. If i cant flow you then I have nothing to go off of for you and it will be very hard for you to win.Give me clear concise voters. I like to hear clashingIf you are doing LD then do LD dont be giving me policy stuff in LD, same with PF, if you are doing PF then do PF. I want to know impacts and big pictures. I like it when you tell me why this matters, what will happen in different senarios, and why I should care. I am not ok with flex preptime. If you want to as questions do it durring CX not durring prep, unless it is to see evidence. Unless there is a medical condition preventing you from standing then I want to see you standing durring speeches and CX. Unless it is PF grandcross. Debate prepares you for your future. Many of your futures you will need to be able to act and look professional. Please start doing so now. If you are going to use your computer then make sure i see you as well and am not looking at just the back of a computersame with the stands. Dont use them to hide behind your stuff. I will buy almost any arguement as long as there is a logical order to what you are saying to me I dont discount any therory just because in the real world it isnt as acheviable. If you can explain your therory well enough and that there is some chance of it happening I will listen. I do prefer cases with both a criterion and a value instead of single standard however if you run the single standard well I am not opposed, I just have not herd a single standard run very well so far.
