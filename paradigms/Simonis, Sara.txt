Yes I can flow, you don't have to speak at conversational pace for me to understand you, but be loud/clear/and understandable. if you're just slowing down on the tags and then doing the text of the card incomprehensibly, I will not be happy or know why your authors think what you're saying is right. i don't like to read evidence, unless it is a card that has been in every speech extended by name but not explained enough for me to give it full weight. don't count on me reading your cards. telling me to read them will not make me read them. what i like: nuanced, technical case debates. kritiks that you clearly understand and care about. politics and T that are more than just what they appear on the surface. i like it when debaters care about the world, each other, and the community that, for whatever reason, we all submit to.
