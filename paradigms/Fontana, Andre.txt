  Hi.

A quick preface to my paradigm: As of right now (pre-Cal Nat), I've judged the high school topic only once. So if/when you do use topic area specific jargon, please try to break it down for me whenever possible (cx, speeches, but ESPECIALLY the 2NR/AR).

TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm pretty much the same in terms of judging biases as almost any other judge that has peered deeply into your sweet, sweet innocent souls (except I'm much more fabulous), so I don't have anything that really deviates from the tabula rasa-esque norm of the contemporary judge.

In terms of paperless debate, 2 things: (1) prep time stops when your files are accessible to the other team (e.g. flash is in their possession). while the other team is getting it up, don't steal prep by fondling with your laptop or whatever. like, just sit back and enjoy life or something idk. And (2) in the event that whoever is speaking is reading evidence that wasn't flashed pre-speech for whatever reason, the other team is entitled to that computer to read the evidence until they're done with it or the speaker's partner flashes the evidence to them. It's only fair brah.

Theory/Framework- Yes
T- Fun
CPs- Cool
DAs- Why not
Ks- Enlighten the room
Performance- Perform and make me cry (tears of joy preferably)

If you need anymore specificity than that then strike me. Jk. Anything more specific either I'd like to refer to you to Aninda Chowdhury's paradigm - I'm mostly aligned to most of the things mostly here - and/or you can ask me pre-round and I'll be more than happy to answer!

Debate hard, argue competitively, learn something to crush other teams with, and, most importantly, have fun!

Seriously, it's so much better to look back on an event where you had a positive attitude in than a negative one.


TL;DR

Debate what you like, try not to suck at it, have fun, and don't steal prep.
