1. Be nice
As a debater, I’ve become increasingly sensitive to unnecessary rudeness and hostility, particularly in cross ex, over things as trivial as the politics link. Respect your opponents and your partner.
If you are very rude or mean you will not receive above a 27.5.
If you speak over and interrupt your partner excessively (giving 20% or more of the speech) you will not receive above a 27.5
With those exceptions, I’m very generous with points.

2. Flex is good
I’ll evaluate all arguments, which doesn’t mean much, but I really think most things are winnable. No strong policy or K bias. Don’t be offensive.

3. Explanation wins debates
Whether it’s the link turn to politics, the K alt, or counterplan solvency, the team with better depth and argument analysis usually wins.

4. Evidence isn’t the end-all be-all
Indicts are great and so is comparison, what I really mean is that true analytics are slayer.

5. I’m a new judge. I take my task very seriously, flow on paper, and will work hard to make the right decision. I’m still learning about myself as a judge, but I am determined to continue to work hard because I respect your time and effort in debates. I’m here to adjudicate, not impose my political will or wield some condescending, all-knowing power over you (with the exception of the being nice thing, you really should all be nice.)
