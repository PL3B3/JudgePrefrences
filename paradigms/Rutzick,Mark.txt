  I am a parent of a high school debater from Oakton High School in Oakton, VA. I have never been a debater. I am an attorney with several decades of courtroom experience.
My judging philosophy is that you are free to present any argument that you think will help you win the debate. There are no limitations. You can present the most odd-ball kritik you want if you think it will help you win the debate. But keep in mind that if I don't agree with you, your chances of winning the debate will decline.
You can talk as fast as you want. But, and this is very important, you need to understand that if I cannot understand you, you will not win the debate. The most brilliant oratory in history is worthless if it is presented so fast that the judge cannot understand you. If you want me to, I will interrupt you and advise you if you are talking so fast that I cannot understand you. If you don't want that information and wish to speak so fast you are unintelligible, then I will remain silent and not give you that information. You have to tell me if you want to inform you that you are talking too fast.
