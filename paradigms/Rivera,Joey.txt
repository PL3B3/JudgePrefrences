  If you are competing at the NFL National Tournament in Birmingham 2013, this is the paradigm for Joey Rivera you are looking for. I was made aware of anther paradigm for a Joey Rivera out there but rest assured as interesting as that paradigm is, it is not mine. At the same time I was also made aware that this Wiki existed so debaters with no real confidence could look up judging paradigms to try and gain some sort of "advantage" in a round. I personally find this practice to be rather sad and pathetic and truly feel a debaters time can be more concerned with other matters versus spending time looking at judging paradigms. I've been doing this long enough to know that in most rounds, about 98% of the time the better debater(s) win the round. furthermore, I find the practice of wasting time looking at a paradigm or asking a judge for his/her paradigm or "preferences" is just that, a waste of time. It's just I find that most debaters will ignore such things and do what they please anyways. However, with all this being said, I write this "paradigm" for those debaters that have taken the time to look this up and still feel it can give them some "advantage" as they "prep" for their judge. The only thing you really need to know is that I have been doing this for a while and I do know what I am doing. However, for those that feel they need a paradigm with more specifics as far as what I'm looking for in a round, I offer you this:

ARBITRATUR HAEC MALA PATIENDA ESSE. CONABIMUR HAEC MALA PATI. NISI MORI VIS PATRERE MALA. MAXIMA MALA PASSUS HOMO MISER MORTUUS EST. TYRANNUS ARBITATUS EST EOS DUOS HAEC MALA DIU PASSUROS ESSE. CUM TRIA BELLA PASSI ESSENT ISTUM TYRANNUM IN EXSILIUM EXPELLERE AUSI SUNT. SI HUNC DUCEM NOVUM SEQUEMINI LIBERTATE ET OTIO UTEMINI. HIS VERBIS DICTIS EUM SEQUI AUSI SUMUS. HAEC VERBA LOCUTI PROFECTI SUMUS NE IN EO LOCO MISERO MOREREMUR. CUM VOS CONSILIO MALO USOS ESSE ARBITRARETUR TAMEN VOBISCUM LIBERE LOCUTUS EST. SI QUIS VINO EIUS GENERIS UTI AUDEAT CELERITER MORIATUR. EODEM DIE FILIUS EIUS NATUS EST ET MORTUUS EST. OMNIBUS OPIBUS NOSTRIS UTAMUR UT PATRIA NOSTRA SERVETUR. CUM IN ALIAM TERRAM PROFICISCI CONARETUR A MILITIBUS CAPTUS EST. ARBITRABAR EUM EX URBE CUM DECUM AMICIS EGRESSURUM ESSE. EA NOCTE PROFECTUS AD QUANDAM INSULAM CLARISSIMAM VENIT. SI MELIORIBUS LIBRIS USI ESSENT PLURA DIDICISSENT. SI MULTOS AMICOS HABERE VIS NOLI ESSE SUPERBUS. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES.
