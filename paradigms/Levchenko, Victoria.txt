Types of debate judged: PF

Debating experience: I have only one formal year of debate experience on the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) circuit. The rest of my experience stems from academic settings, such as class debates, papers, and such.

Preferred Debating Styles/Arguments: I favor arguments that have a clear calculus behind them. Therefore, build your arguments step by step. Answer these questions: what is the reason and why is it relevant/strong? I know that it is a challenge to present everything clearly when you're in the moment, so try your best at it. Keep a steady pace, do not throw around statistics without discussing exactly what they signify and the impact they have on the debate, show some energy, and have some fun!

For cross-x: Be direct and logical - pick out the fallacies, test the assumptions the other argument is based on. Do not nit-pick, aim to undermine something substantial in the other team's arguments. 

For rebuttals: Do not repeat every single, previously made argument. As the debate goes on, each point organically grows to another level of interpretation (and all that exciting, riveting jazz). So don't repeat the old argument. Frame everything in the context of what was said on both sides. State: the biggest points of clash, why your side has the weightiest arguments, how the opposing team's arguments reflect on your case (are they truly criticisms or misunderstandings of your position, does the other side truly disprove what you said), and what it all implies. 

All in all, have a good time and be enthusiastic. These are some great memories that you're making. When you look back, whether you did crazy well or crazy bad, it will be a great story. Cheers to a good round!
