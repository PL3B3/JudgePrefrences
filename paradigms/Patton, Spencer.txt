I am a college student graduating from Vanderbilt University w/ a double major in Econ / Psych in May '08. I did debate on the circuit for 4 years, and have taught / currently teach at various summer camps from 2004-present. As far as specific preferences, while I don't prefer speedy debates, I can certainly flo it. I understand the need for sometimes speedy rebuttals, that is just part of debate, but I prefer, if given the option, to keep it at an enjoyable pace. I do like to hear a Value / Criterion structure as it helps me understand how to best funnel your case into the resolution. Moreover, I even more strongly request, almost demand, voting issues. They can be down-the-flo or at the end, but I do want to hear, for no less than 30 seconds, why I ought vote for you. Give me numbered reasons of the things that I should pay particular attention to. Other than that, be nice to your opponent, and have fun. I always disclose at the end of the round unless prohibited by the tournament.
