  I debated at Mayde Creek high school in Katy, Texas from 2000-2004. I taught at UNT for several summers following my graduation.

I haven’t been very active in debate over the last few years so should adjust accordingly.
I would recommend the following things:

Don’t speak at your top speed. I’m not philosophically opposed to spreading but I will have a hard time keeping up as I am a bit rusty. You won’t be voted down for exceeding my preferred rate but I will have a difficult time voting for arguments I don’t have on my flow.Go easy on the debate jargon. Once again, I’m not opposed to the use of jargon but you might lose me if you are throwing around terms that I don’t understand.Focus on winning substance. I’m most comfortable evaluating arguments that are clearly impacted back to a justified value criterion. I prefer not to vote on things like theory or presumption triggers.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round. Have fun.
