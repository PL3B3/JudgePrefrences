  WARNING! THINGS TO NOT READ IN FRONT OF ME: arguments about suicide, intimate partner violence, personal narratives, or anything else reasonable people shouldn't read before asking first. If you read these things, my ability to judge the debate objectively will be extremely compromised, and you will probably not like the result.

I am a current debater for Lake Highland Preparatory School (4th year). I am familiar with all debate styles, including high level circuit debate (I will be at the Tournament of Champions) and traditional (I was a Florida State semifinalist). Fast or slow is fine.

Arguments preferences: I am fine with anything you want to do stylistically, as long as you don't talk about some of the issues above. I primarily run K arguments and debate theory a lot. My familiarity with any argument you could go for will be fine.

Shoot me a message if you have any additional worries!
