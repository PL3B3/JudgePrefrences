  It’s entirely up to you to decide what to run. Do whatever you feel comfortable with and show me why you should win this round.
1. Speaking – Be clear and be organized because that helps me flow. If I can’t flow you, that will hurt you. Be respectful to your opponents. I will take off points on gendered language and other offensive/non pc language.
2. Topicality – Voting issue comes before anything. Debate your standards well.
3. Theory – I have a fairly high threshold, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t run things like condo/perfcon because those can sometimes be abusive
4. Counterplans – You can run any CP. It should be competitive. Explain the solvency advocate. The more specific, the better. 
5. Disadvantages – I evaluate the risk of the link + impact and compare them to the case.
6. Kritiks – I ran them. I’m familiar with most of the literature used in policy. But, you still have to explain them well. Explain the role of the ballot.
7. Impact calculus is important. Very important.
8. I would like to see evidence comparison and you arguing your evidence, not your evidence arguing for you
You can ask me more specific questions before the round.
