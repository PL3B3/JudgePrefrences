  Hey, I debated at Damien for four years went to the TOC a couple times and now go to USC
Some thoughts:

Aff:

Affirmatives should defend the hypothetical enactment of a topical plan. Middle of the road or big stick, doesn't matter to me. 


Neg:

Read what you want as long as it engages the affirmative in a meaningful manner. This necessarily excludes decontextualized criticisms 

T/Theory:

My default is competing interpretations, but interpretations should be reasonable.


Reject the argument not the team, except for conditionality.


DA:

DA's other than politics are awesome, but I went for politics a fair amount in high school.

CP:

I prefer cp's to compete functionally/textually, but it is possible for a team to persuade me otherwise 

PIC's are awesome.

Advantage CP's are awesome.

International fiat tows a fine line. Could be persuaded it's good or bad.
Process Cp's and consult cp's tow the line even more
K:

I am not biased against these per se but they are by far the hardest argument to execute, absent dropped silver bullets i.e. root cause, ontology first, or floating pik's.

Framework should be impacted.

Links should be responsive to the content of the 1AC.

Impacts should be based off of such links, not the overall knowledge/material/methodological structure you are criticizing. K's should not be an excuse to sidestep conventional impact comparison.

Alternatives should either be explained to solve such links or explained within a framework that makes alternative solvency irrelevant.


Judge:

Explanation over evidence. If you ask me to read a card after the round which has warrants not explained in the debate, those warrants are irrelevant.

Tech and truth. Technical concessions matter, but there can be larger truths which belittle the weight of such concessions. Control framing to control the debate.

Rebuttals. Make choices. Go for what you are ahead on, and explain why what you are ahead on is more important than what you are behind on using even if statements.

Prep time ends after you are done writing the speech.


Debate's a game have fun!
