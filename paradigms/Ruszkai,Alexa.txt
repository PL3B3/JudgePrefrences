  Because Lincoln-Douglas is a value debate I consider how well the debater upholds his value and criterion to be most important. I don't judge a debater based on the extent of the evidence offered but rather on how well the debater applies various philosophical, ethical, and logical theories to the topic. I can follow spreading however I prefer a slower pace of speaking.
