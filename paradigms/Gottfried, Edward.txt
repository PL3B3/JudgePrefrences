I subscribe to a more conservative standard of policy, in which the case is the heart of the argument. I think counter-plans and disads are good. I think topicality is ok. I favor teams who know their cards inside and out, and can argue the warrants behind their tags. In my mind, rounds come down to rebuttals focussed on impact calculus and link strength. I dislike theory (though obviously it is occasionally necessary, in moderation), and consider kritiks dishonest in almost every way. Speed is fine, but never as a substitute for analysis and actual argument; card cascades will be considered poor sportsmanship. More than anything, though, I believe debate is fun. Play by the rules, be respectful to your opponents and judges, have a good time with it. And maybe see if you can't work a joke in there somewhere.
