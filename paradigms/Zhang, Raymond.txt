Nationals 2015:

There has been some changes in my paradigm. The following are the information I think will be relevant:

- I am a game judge

-I dont allow for new arguments in the last 2 speeches of the debate LD and Policy

-Everything else as of this point is free game. You will need to give me a reason to vote for you at the end of the round
- I'm more picky about statistics and scientific research. I will pay attention to how you use these studies and if I KNOW you are misrepresenting evidence then my bright line for counter arguments against it will be lowered.

- Please ask questions before round as my opinions of debate are constantly changing.
