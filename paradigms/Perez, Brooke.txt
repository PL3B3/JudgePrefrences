I have judged a lot this year locally for University School. After beginning in PF Debate I requested to judge something different and asked to judge LD as that is what my nephew, Michael Fried, debates. Since January I have been judging LD at local tournaments. I am a lawyer and love the activity of debate. I like a strong cross-examination combined with the ability to take out the central points throughout your opponent's case. Being relatively new to judging LD it's important to note that while I'm not philosophically opposed to debaters going fast it would be unwise to "spread" in front of me. Please have a civil round with direct clash.
