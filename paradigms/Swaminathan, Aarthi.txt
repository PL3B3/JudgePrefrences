  Hello! I am a parent judge. I love to see a good, polite debate. Please do not be rude to your opponents. I’d prefer that you do not speak super fast and utilize complicated language. Simplicity is key. Enunciate your words and speak clearly. A moderate speech with vivid language is definitely better than going rocket speed and spewing as many facts as you can. I will not know acronyms you use (such as THAAD). I’d prefer you say the entire thing or rather summarize it for me in layman’s terms. I like debaters that are able to think on their feet. I hope to judge a great round!
