I value explanation over evidence, and I will attempt to make my decision without calling for cards if possible. I will vote for whatever argument I believe wins except in the case of morally abhorrent arguments (ie "Racism Good/ Sacred Cow) If you settle on an argument because of a technical drop you still must explain the argument and defend it to get my ballot (don't just say "X argument was dropped: we win").

I am a lay judge. I evaluate the round based on stock issues and the persuasiveness of the arguments offered. I do not pretend to have any knowledge about any of the obscura of policy debate, but I try to take detailed notes.

I will not follow you if you spread, sorry I am just not trained to do this.Speaking clearly will benefit your speaker points and your chance of winning more than reading one or two more cards. I will notice and appreciate good teamwork. I flow with pens and paper. If I can't understand the text of your evidence I will tell you to be clearer. Your prep time ends when your speech document is saved or when you stop writing. I will try to remember to time your speeches and record prep time, but you should do this too. Please don't cheat. Don't be carelessly rude. If you have additional questions ask me in person or email me. Most importantly, have fun.


Hope this helps.
