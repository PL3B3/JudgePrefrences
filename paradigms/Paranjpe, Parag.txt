  I consider myself a critic of argumentation. 

ABSOLUTELY NO SPREADING. I prefer a slow debate with ethos, pathos, and logos.

Speaker points will be based on execution and style. I believe that in the real world, the way you present can be far more important than the content of your argument.

I use the full speaker points scale: I start from 26.5 and move upward. A 28 is exceptional from me.
