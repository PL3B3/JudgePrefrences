  Affiliation: Debate Coach at Overland High School in Denver, Colorado
Debates Judged: LD and PF

Experience: Coach since 2013. Debated in high school, 2004-2008. Semifinalist at Cal Invitational in PF, 2008.

Philosophy: All arguments are fair game as long as they are impacted and supported by credible evidence. I will not make decisions based on personal opinions, only those arguments that are presented during round. If arguments are not impacted and supported, I will not account for them in my flow. Furthermore, if framework is provided, please link arguments to framework (a must in LD). In LD, I heavily weigh the value clash.
Speed is acceptable, but spreading is not. If you are speaking too quickly for me to understand an argument, I cannot account for the argument.
