2007-2010: Policy debate at Claremont High School

I mostly work with JV and Novice teams in the BAUDL
I haven't judged many varsity rounds on this year's topic
Please slow down on tags and theory. i will say clear once. if you aren't clear after that i will stop flowing

Speed should never trade off with the clarity of the argument

I consider warrants more than the card's author or taglines


I try to be a Tabla Rasa judge, so feel free to run what you want. This does not mean, however, that you do not need to justify why you’re running the arguments you run. Disad-counterplan strategies should still defend and explain why a policy framework is best and K, T, or theory strategies should do the same.

I hold a high threshold for theory and topicality arguments. You will need to clearly articulate what specific ground do you lose, why is their interpretation or violation unfair, and what specifically happens to education. If you want to win on theory or T, be prepared to invest significant time.

On Kritiks, you can’t win without detailed explanations of your link story and precisely how the impact relates to or interacts with case advantages. On framework, I need a clear explanation of the impacts to your standards and why your interpretation makes for a better world of debate. I was a K debater so I am familiar with some of the literature. However, I haven’t debated since 2010, so don’t assume that I know all of the literature from your K.

Other Stuff:

Please keep the time you spend jumping ev to a minimum

Debate should be a fun and educational experience -- it's not life or death. Don't be rude to your opponents and don't be rude to me. If you have questions after the round, make sure they're actually questions and not attempts at convincing me to change my decision after the ballot is already signed.
