Philosophy:

A judge's decision is grounded only by the arguments that are presented to him/her in a debate. 

The crazier and more unusual the argument, the less likely that I would vote for it, absent a huge investment in explanation and analysis throughout
the debate. So go ahead and run performance, but your performance obviously has some deeper truth you want me to vote on. Tell me what truth that is
and why I should use my ballot to endorse this truth instead of simply voting for the Negative and rejecting the resolution.

If you feel that speed and clarity are mutually exclusive, then I would suggest you focus on clarity over speed.
