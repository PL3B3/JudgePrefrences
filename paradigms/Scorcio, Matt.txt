  Judge Philosophy for Matt Scorcio

I debated for Navy for four years, and I am a 1L at Stanford Law. Stanford’s tournament will be my first on this year’s topic, so you’re encouraged to explain your topic-specific arguments.

I will be most familiar with policy arguments, such as disads and counterplans on the neg, and advocating USFG action on the aff.

If you run critical or performance arguments then I will be listening for how your advocacy interacts with the topic, and how your advocacy impacts debate as an activity.
