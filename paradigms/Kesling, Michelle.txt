  Judge Philosophy for Michelle Kesling

Written by Bruce Najor

Michelle is a good judge, she keeps a great, clean, pretty flow. Winning the big picture is more important than winning every little nuance on the technical / flow centered side. She is not a “slave to the flow”

Michelle likes:

Well thought out strategies
Clove and camel cigarettes 
Critical arguments that link to the plan
C/Ps with critical net benefits 
Rum and coke
Topicality with a clear, non-arbitrary definition 
extra analysis over extra cards that say the same thing
hipster boys
Disads that turn the case (with a warrant) 
critiques of the personal choices made by the other team (Seriously... I know... I'm working on changing this)
puppies 

Michelle doesn't like:

Theory debates
Counterplans that do all of the plan
That one annoying kid in her interpersonal class 
Multiple 1NC C/Ps
Rudeness and hostile cross-x
The electric company 
Afirmatives that don't have a plan text
Deleting ex-boyfriends from her phone
Negatives that read 9 off and just try to bully the other aff out of the round 
Abstract critiques and teams who try to confuse the other team with them
