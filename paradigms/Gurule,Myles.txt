Coach for Debate RI
I did two years of LD and two years of policy in High School, but I'm much more proficient with policy. 

I'm generally fine with speed, make sure you're clear on tags. 

Every argument should have some sort of impact calc/explain why it matters/framework; if it doesn't, I suppose I default to policymaking.
I try not to vote on things you don't say (I strive to be 'tab ras'/avoid judge intervention).

I enjoy Ks and critical affs. If you're going to run one, be clear about what you're saying, and how it relates to the other team. Define/explain jargon. The best debaters can explain complex arguments in (relatively) simple, clear, concise, and concrete terms. Think critically about what your alt is. Lenses that show why the plan is wrong/bad are awesome. 'Create a fracture in capitalism with our discourse' is fuzzy and you probably need framework re: fiat.
