I don't care what arguments you read. I care how well you debate. Accordingly, listed below are the principles I use when I judge.

Tech determines truth. This has three implications:
1. What and how you argue is nearly always more important than the evidence you read.
2. I will only evaluate what is on the flow, and accordingly, the only predisposition I have is line-by-line. Keep the flow clean and organized.
3. Dropped arguments are true arguments. If they weren't, people wouldn't answer the best arguments. Use line-by-line concessions to frame the debate.

Any argument is compelling to me if it is has an impact. Regardless of an argument's real world validity, I will adjudicate in the most objective manner possible. This, of course, relies on you adhering to the flow so that I can evaluate what has been said, rather than what I think.

I have a limited knowledge of post-structural thought. I have no reservations voting for critiques, provided you execute them in a technically-superior manner.

New arguments: It is the responsibility of the debaters to justify whether new arguments are permissible in any given speech. If the question of new arguments goes untouched, I will default to ignoring new arguments made in the 1AR and onwards.

Be competitive, but more importantly, be decent human beings. No one has fun when debaters make each other uncomfortable. I will reward debaters who argue with a strategic balance of stubbornness, ambition, and courtesy; conversely, those who choose to antagonize and debate in an overly aggressive manner will be penalized.
