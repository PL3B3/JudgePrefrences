  I will vote on value and value criterion framework, and how well any arguments relate to said framework. Cases should be strong and debaters should be confident speakers. 
Moderate speaking speed is preferred, I will vote based only on what I can hear and understand. Technicalities and/or theory shouldn't be major parts of the round, unless the theory is very properly explained. I'm not a fan of kritiks or narratives, for the most part.
