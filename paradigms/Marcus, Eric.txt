  Pine Crest Class of 2014
Emory Class of 2018

General things:
Tech over truth
Prep time ends when you are ready to put the speech on the flash drive
I’ve been both a 2A and 2N in high school, so I won’t be more inclined to vote aff than neg or vice-versa
I will vote on any argument, but winning on certain arguments gets you lower speaker points than others (ex: a-spec)
I won’t call “clear” unless I simply cannot get the tags down, so if I call “clear”, don’t ignore it
If you cheat, you will lose and receive the lowest speaker points allowed by the tournament

Topicality:
Topicality is not a reverse voting issue
Saying “no in-round abuse” is a waste of time

DA’s:
There can be zero risk of a DA
If uniqueness is something that is probabilistic/constantly changing, the link controls the direction of the DA
Politics DA’s are probably good for debate, but a well-articulated politics theory argument can still take out the DA

CP’s:
Theory issues relating to CP’s (other than conditionality) are reasons to reject the argument
Well-researched advantage CP’s > generic process CP’s
It shouldn’t be that hard to beat process CP’s on the perm and theory, but you have to do the work
I won’t kick the CP for you unless it is an explicitly stated 2NR option and the aff doesn’t do enough work explaining why judge kick is bad

K’s:
The only K’s where I would describe my background knowledge as average or better are Derrida-style K’s, Afro-pessimism, security, and capitalism
I need to understand what the alt does and why it solves to vote neg, otherwise try-or-die framing will be very persuasive
If the alt is do nothing, you have to win a robust framework argument
Contextualize the link to the aff, or I won’t be very receptive to certain turn’s case arguments
If you want to go for arguments like “fiat illusory”, I need to know how it interacts with the way I frame my overall view of the flow

K Aff’s/Framework:
If you choose not to defend a hypothetical government action, you should still at least talk about the topic
Whoever wins that their method provides the best training for the real world will win the round
If the K aff has a plan that you state in cross-x that you will defend, I won’t view aff arguments about discourse/things other than the plan as important.

Cross-x:
Cross-x is binding. If you somebody asks you what arguments were made somewhere, and you leave out an argument, that left-out argument is no longer part of the debate (there are exceptions to this rule)
If your partner answers all of your cross-x questions, you will receive lower speaker points.
