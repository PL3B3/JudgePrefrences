  Hi. I debated LD for Bellarmine College Prep (CA) for 4 years and now attend the University of Pennsylvania. I was mainly a traditional debater, and that's probably going to translate into me being a more traditional judge. What this means is that you should go a bit slower (I can take some speed but not a lot) and should VERY clearly explain the function of progressive arguments (theory, Ks, etc etc). However, I strongly prefer that you adhere to the value/value criterion model. If you have any questions, please ask before the round.
