  Hi,


I am totally new to the debate arena. I teach 9th grade English and began a debate club/team last year. We got our feet wet and muddy, but the kids loved it, especially the debate events. This honestly surprised me because there is so much research involved.

I have never debated in my life, but see the rigor and relevance it provides and this excites me. However, I must admit I feel overwhelmed. I am reading the philosophies and have no idea what most of you are talking about...signposting? What is that??

However, I am willing to learn. One thing I dislike about debate is there is no real support for the novice. People are helpful at tournaments, but I still feel like a fish out of water.

My philosophy...I have judged enough to know that I want clarity of writing and speaking. I don't like the attitude of some of the debaters. Basically, we are required to judge as a novice coach, which personally, I think is the wrong approach. It is obvious to the students that we don't have a clue what we are doing...that breeds disrespect, although it shouldn't.

If the NFL truly wants to become more diverse, they will need to provide more support for new coaches.
