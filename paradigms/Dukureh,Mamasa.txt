  I am a policy debater and I like policy oriented arguments more than critical arguments. If a team does run a critique and explains it well, (not just reads the cards) but understands the argument they are making I will vote for them. Please go line by line, it makes it so much easier for me to flow. I'm fine with open cross-ex as long as your partner is not dominating. There is no need to be rude in a debate and if you are, I will deduct speaker points away from you.

Flowing: I am not the world's fastest flower but I get many arguments. If it's not on the flow, then I can't say you made the argument.

Topicality: I really like Topicality. If your going to go for T in the 2NR it needs to be all five minutes of your speech. Really explain your impacts.

D/A: On the link debate, the more specific the link, the stronger your argument. The more generic it is, the weaker your argument. For your impacts probability, time frame, and magnitude help make your impacts stronger and more believable. Please use them.

CP: Your net benefit makes your CP. Explain it well and talk about its mutual exclusiveness. Answer theory and the perm. Not responding to these arguments will cost you the flow.

Kritiks/Framework: I'm not a fan but if you explain it really well, then you'll get the flow.

Theory: I'm indifferent about. I feel for it the same I feel for the kritik.
