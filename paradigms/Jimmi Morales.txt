  I default to the Losers-Win Paradigm. Whoever I feel is losing arguments in the debate will get my vote and I will do my best to find some random reason of why I voted them up to put on the ballot. With that said, if both of the opponents look like they're TRYING to lose just to get my ballot (as debate has become just a game of winning lately), I will give a double loss.
