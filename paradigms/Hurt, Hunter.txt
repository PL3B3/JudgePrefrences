Debated 4 years in high school. Here's my senior year wiki: https://hspolicy16.debatecoaches.org/West+Des+Moines+Valley/

Primarily I see debate a space for competitors to hone skills and find new ways to understand the world around them. As such, I think that it is up to the debaters to define what is and is't important in deciding the round.
I am willing to vote on/listen to any argument you're willing to present, i will reward clever or strong argumentative strategy and punish messy or contradictory strategies, especially those which rely on an element of in-round performance or representation.
I flow, and generally appreciate, cross-ex. However, an argument made in cx is more persuasive if anchored in an actual speech.
