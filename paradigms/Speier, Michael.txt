I have been judging for several years. My preferences are reasonably standard: genuine courtesy between teams, no sarcastic fighting and definitely no insults. I don't mind -- in fact, I prefer - human interaction. That is to say: I don't need robots in the room. We are all human. Normal discourse about the day or the weather or sports or politics is more than OK with me before and after the round. I just think "usual" behavior should be the rule.

As for the rounds, certainly I like people who do their research and can present it smartly. However, people who get too ahead of themselves definitely lose favor with me. Making an argument, but then not being able to back it up with confidence, makes me wonder if they really know what the argument is in the first place. It's easy to come out on fire, but it's harder to sustain it, which is why THOSE participants usually win many points with me.

I like balance. Starting strong but ending weak is not preferable. Neither, the other way. Instead, a solid round that goes from start to finish - that usually does the trick with me.
