  I am a fairly lay judge, but I have had some experience debating many years ago. I generally evaluate arguments if they are articulated well on the flow. That being said, be very clear with signposting, give me roadmaps before every speech, and be very clear where you are debating and cross-applying arguments on the flow. 
 I will vote on any type of argument, but I suggest that you stay away from dense kritikal debate and theory debate. Policy style arguments are fine so long as you explain their function in the round. Don’t speak too fast. I will say “clear” once if I start to lose you, but after that I’ll dock off speaker points if you're going too fast or being unclear. 
 Give me a way to measure the round. Be clear with value/value criterion debate and link back to the framework. If you win arguments but don’t explain what they mean in the context of the round, then you’re wasting your time. 
 Be assertive, speak clearly and loudly, don’t be rude to your opponent, look at me during cross-ex, the usual. Have fun and good luck.
