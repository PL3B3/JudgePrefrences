  Debate Experience: Became involved in policy debate in September of 2008 as a coach for Newark East Side

Philosophy:

Greetings everyone,

I am a relatively new participant to policy debate. With that said, feel free to spread, I am pretty good with speed (just try to make the tags and citations clear). I will vote for pretty much anything - a well run DA, K, CP, and as of late, even T. If you are going to run T, please be VERY clear on how it is abusive and how it affects the level of education in the round. On your DAs, you gotta do a lot of work telling me why it outweighs case, same for the CP and the net benefits. As for the K, please spend some time on the link debate as well as the alt. How the alt will solve weighs a lot when judging. I am open to pretty much most K debates (especially Cap , which always brings a smile to my face when run well).

I am getting a lot more comfortable judging framework. If you are going to run framework, I want to hear some time spent in the neg block, not just a card or two. Other than that, I am pretty much open to anything.......I even voted for a politics DA once.

Lastly, I would just like to say that while debaters put a tremendous amount of time and energy into this sport (which I know is an understatement), let's remember to keep it civil within the rounds. While being obnoxious may not cost you the round, it will definitely affect the speaker points.
