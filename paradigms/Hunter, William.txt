  Like Values. tolerate some plan, c/p, but all advantages should all funnel into values argumentation solely, what's with the
"morally permissible" phrase if not values? 
C-X for clarification, not for attempted beat-downs, yes a well-phrased trap is surely fine--
HOW DO YOU OBTAIN Your Value in Practice (criterion argumentation does matter!)???
How's I Judge: Whose Value Argumentation Best Spikes Off Case-Side Argumentation to Gain NET GROWTH in Values
Actualization in Real Time Society??? Like, indeed Bringing More/Better Justice (however you define it) to life!
