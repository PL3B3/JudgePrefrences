  I am an ex-LD debater. I graduated in '07. I prefer a traditional value based debate. I can follow speed to a certain extent, but if you start to spread I will put my pen down, and if I don't flow your argument it does not count in the round. Cards are fine as long as they are concise and prove a point, but I prefer clearly explained logical arguments to convulted, misappropriated cards. If an argument is clearly abusive or non-conducive with Lincoln-Douglas debate, point it out to me and give me a reason or two why that is so. If not, I will have to buy the argument because it is on the flow. Also, make sure to impact everything and in your rebuttals give me a short explanation of why it matters that your opponent dropped your point. If not, the drop doesn't matter. In general, I decide the round based on the flow: whoever still has arguments that link to the value and has a value that still stands in the round wins.
