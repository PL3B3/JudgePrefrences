  I am a parent judge with experience judging at local tournaments. I prefer the traditional value/criterion case structure. If you read your arguments in a different format, you must explain that format to me. I will flow the round and do my best to evaluate it objectively, but I will only vote for arguments that are clearly explained the first time I hear them. This also means that arguments should be articulated at a conversational pace. Please signpost throughout the debate and give clear voters. Be polite to your opponent at all times during the round.
