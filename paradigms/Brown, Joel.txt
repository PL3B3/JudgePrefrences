  I judge policy debate as an exercise in public policymaking. I expect the affirmative team to advocate a policy meeting the resolution and I expect the negative team to make arguments about why that policy should be rejected. Based upon my philosophy, all stock issues should be met and upheld for the affirmative team to earn the win. 
 
I do consider myself open to any arguments presented. Convince me to vote for you using any method you choose, but be sure to relate it to the support or opposition of the policy presented by the affirmative team. If you are going to run a kritik, it should provide a reason to either accept or reject the affirmative plan. Counterplans are also great if they are competitive and therefore give some reason to reject the affirmative policy. Be creative, clear, and organized and you increase your chances of receiving my vote.

Clarity is much more important than speed. IF you can be clear AND fast, flowing won’t be a problem. If I can’t follow your arguments, you are not effectively articulating your arguments and it will be difficult for you to get a decision in your favor. 
 
Road map and sign post. It will help me with the above. 
 
Polite and respectful debaters will be viewed positively. Abusive or condescending attitudes and body language will impact my decision.

Dislikes:  

Quantity over quality of arguments. I am looking for depth and strength of arguments and the evidence supporting them. I dislike having to sift through many arguments created on a shallow level. You are more likely to win by developing a few deep arguments supported by quality evidence rather than reading many arguments with little development and follow through. 
 
Rude and obnoxious debates will irritate me.
