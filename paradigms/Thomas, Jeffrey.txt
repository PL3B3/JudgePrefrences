  Kritiks: I like Ks alot I think they make the rounds more interesting, however, all Ks must clearyl link and must be explained as clearly as possible. Nothing wrong with framework either, 

Theory: Not really a big fan of theory, but if you've clearly won on theory i'll vote on it

I like when rounds go quick, smooth, and clean. Not a big fan of fights whether its between teems or teemmates, leave that stuff for 3:00 on the playground or your speaker points are going down. If you are paperless you'de better have a viewing computer or a way to jump files to the other team. It is unfair to be reading cards the other team doesn't get to see. I understand when there are computer problems and such but these should be kept to a minimum if it can be helped and jumping files should be done as quickly as possible.
