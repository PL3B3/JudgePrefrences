I highly prefer straightforward policy rounds. Meaning, no critical arguments. I don't like 90% of the kritiks I hear,not because of the kritik itself but because I'm almost never told how to evaluate the K in comparison to the opposing team's arguments. I love topicality and framework. Clash and extension of arguments are very important. For example, if something is dropped in the 1AR, if the 2AR extends it and talks about it, I'm not going to evaluate it at the end of the round. Speaks are based off of how convincing you say what you say. I don't really care how rude you are to each other, I tend to find it amusing. I don't consider anything said in CX at the end of the round unless an argument in made in a speech. I'll tell you "clear" if I can't follow your speed.
