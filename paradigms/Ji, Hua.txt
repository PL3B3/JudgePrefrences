  I’m relatively new to the LD world. I like this form of debate because it provides high school students with an opportunity to think and express intellectual ideas on topics that are not part of their regular school curriculum.
I am open-minded to all arguments in general so long as they are adequately substantiated; however, if you do choose to run any kind of philosophy please explain it thoroughly. I prefer the Value/Criterion type of organization but will accept any logical organizational style. Please ROADMAP your arguments. Any argument I miss will not be considered. 
I accept any reasonable theory type arguments; however, please note that I will disregard any blatantly abusive theory arguments. On Kritiks, I will accept Ks so long as they are developed properly and clearly linked to the resolution. Please also note that if you do run a Kritik, I expect you to thoroughly elaborate on the link and explicitly state how it relates to the resolution – don’t leave it to me to decide. 
I prefer conversational speed or a bit faster – no speed/spreading. I will signal to each debater twice if the delivery becomes too rapid or yell clear. Clarity is really important to me as a judge. Make clear impact of you claims, make comprehensive analysis and answer all your opponents’ arguments. 
*It is key that you crystallize well and thoroughly address voting issues.
