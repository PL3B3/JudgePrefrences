Overview: I debated policy debate for Carbon High School in Price, Utah for 3 years and debated CEDA for the College of Eastern Utah for one year. I also debated in Parliamentary Debate for one year at Southern Utah University.

Topicality: I have voted on T in the past. I have to see a clear indication in which the aff is being abusive to vote on it.

Disads: I need strong internal links and specific links to the plan. I am also open to Turns on the disad debate. I am also realistic on the impact debate. Not everything will lead to nuclear war...=)

Counterplans: I vote on CPs with a clear net benefit scenario and limited permutations from the aff - mutually exclusive

Kritiks: The K debate is a good one. I think the more specific a K to plan, the more willing I am to vote on it


Final Thoughts: I don't like to intervene in debate rounds. I want you to tell me where to vote and convincing in your scenarios. Please do not use generic link arguments. I like to read evidence at the end of the rounds. Do NOT drop arguments. I have voted on that alone in the past.
