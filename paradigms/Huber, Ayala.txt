        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        No preference 

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Articulate the argument well and are clear when speaking 

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Slurs words, is rude, or is incomprehensible 

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        No preference 

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        Ill vote on anything, give me a reason why I should evaluate the argument and why you win it

        Explain your ratings, if you like

        I can evaluate most K's but i havent read much of the literature. That being said you need to be explicit about what the link and alt are how neg solves(or doesnt) if i dint buy alt solvency or the link I probably wont vote on it.

    
    
        Comments on flowing or speed:

        I can handle speed 90% of the time, there is a point where you can spread faster than i can flow
