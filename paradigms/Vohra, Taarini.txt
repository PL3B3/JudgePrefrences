 So my paradigm is fairly straightforward: debate in whatever style you're most comfortable with and I should be able to understand what is going on and follow the round. I believe that if you're good, then anyone should be able to follow you. That being said, I was on the debate team at the Hockaday School in Dallas for four years and traveled a great deal on the national/TOC circuit. I have terrible handwriting so while I can follow quick rounds speak rapidly at your own risk. I personally dislike theory debates unless they are called for (that is, there is actual and clear abuse in round), don't like discourse arguments unless they are sincere (that is, they are very developed and aren't being used as a time-suck), and tend to prefer non-critical argumentation. If I don't understand the argument, I won't vote on it. I also don't like voting off of blippy extensions. Be sure to give a good decision calculus and you'll be fine. I won't yell clear in a round if I feel that the debater is being unclear since I think that's unfair to your opponent. And most importantly, be nice and have fun!
