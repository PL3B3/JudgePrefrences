  I am a traditional judge and would prefer it if debaters didn't spread or read theory and other types of progressive arguments. To get my ballot, please focus on giving clear overviews and voting issues (rather than going for every argument). The more intuitive (and real-world) your arguments seem to me, the more likely I am to vote for them.
