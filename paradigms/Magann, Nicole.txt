  I have been a debate coach for the past 15 years. I have coached students who have placed in LD in Nationals. I have taught philosophy and LD at summer institutes in Utah. I wrote a topic paper for CX that made it to the final two topics a few years ago. Most recently, I have been working with the varsity LDers on my son's team.

I am a traditional judge but understand that there are movements to make LD more progressive. I will vote on the arguments and evidence. That being said, since this is LD and not policy, I still expect a value/criteria debate. Kritiks are fine if they link. In some ways, kritiks make more sense in LD than policy. If you running disads or other "traditionally policy" arguments, they better tie into a value/criteria debate. I do not believe that LD should be a two person policy debate.

I do flow and can handle speed. Speed should be used effectively to get the most arguments in and not to simply spread your opponent out of the round. Since I flow, I am a flow judge. The arguments better be on the flow and not something mentioned in CX or alluded to. I look for clear voters in the final arguments. 

If you have any questions about my philosophy, please feel free to ask me before the round.
