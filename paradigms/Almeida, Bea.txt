  I have 4 years of LD experience (2 as a debater, 2 as a judge) with Harrison High School in Harrison, New York.



Hello friends, here are some things that I like:-when you crystallize and weigh!! (weighing? in debate? *gasp*)-when you don't do sketchy things! (refer to burn book for sketchy, but you probably know. Don't lie to yourself.)-when you're not obnoxious!

Speed is fine, but just slow down turning cards names and texts of CPs and plans.


Argument specific fun stuff:
 I've come to learn that I really enjoy Ks (cap ks are a bit painful tho ngl) and I really like cases that are interesting and and have really "out there" philosophical fws. (make sure I understand them tho, I like the because I like to learn.)


The following is my own personal burn book:
-AFC
-Frivolous theory (that does not mean theory in general but remember that I hate sketchy people)
-tricks!!!!! H8 them!!!!
-SKEP
-Disclosure theory


please please please, don't shift your advocacy in the middle of the 1AR (to get out of a cap k) by saying you defend communist China


WEIGH, CRYSTALIZE, EXPLAIN. Assume I'm the laziest person in the world and tell me exactly why you're winning and why your arguments are better. If I have to weigh arguments on my own, you might not like how I do it. :)

If you're sexist or obnoxious I will not hesitate to drop you, fair warning.
 



*bonus speaks if you make science jokes/make me laugh

Further, please wear proper attire during round.(Jk, my debater just wanted to make it into my paradigm, ripped pants and all.)
