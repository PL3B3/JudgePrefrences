  Have a clearly defined standard on which to weigh the round. I vote primarily on how arguments impact back to the standard (criteria), and prefer that debaters doing the weighing of arguments for me. I am a stickler for the traditional structure of args: claim, warrant, impact; judge all rounds based on the flow, and prefer a line-by-line approach if at all possible; being from Texas, I can take a bit of speed, but prefer quality over quantity.
Finally, voters are a must.

Read Jane Boyd's LD philosophy--it describes my outlook pretty accurately.
