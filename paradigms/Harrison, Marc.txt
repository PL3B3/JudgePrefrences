  I am a parent,and am new to judging Public Forum. Iâ€™m not fluent in debate jargon, so please try to use whole words.

Speed: I can understand fairly rapid speech, but you will lose me if you spread excessively.

Arguments: I think the best arguments are based on evidence from a wide variety of primary sources and not just the one source that you think is most trustworthy. I am uninterested in cases that try to win a debate based on technicalities in the wording of the resolution.

Points: Points will be awarded based on the quality of your argument (sound reasoning, strong evidence, good organization, persuasiveness, and the ability to ask and respond to incisive questions) as well as the clarity and civility of your speech.
