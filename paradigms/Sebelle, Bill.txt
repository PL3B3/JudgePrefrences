I will vote for anything so long as it is properly warranted, articulated and implemented in the round. Absent any clearly defined framework my predisposition is that debate is a game and the rules of that game are flexible and debatable. Just make sure that whatever argument you chose to run you justify it well and I will vote for the most compelling and well warranted argument coming out of the rebuttals.
