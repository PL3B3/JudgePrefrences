  Experience: 11 Years of teaching/coaching 4-6A high school debate. I'm familiar with PFD and LD and prefer LD. 

I prefer traditional LD with no spreading (if I can't understand you it is a problem). I look for manners, a clash and a value based debate in LD. Structure as well as a well developed case are important. Whoever is supporting their value and criterion with their contentions and gives the best argument for their case and against their opponent will probably win. I do however dislike being told how I must vote and it can be reflected in the points and decision.
