I'm comfortable with theory, Ks, and whatever else a debater wants to throw out there as long as its well-warranted and there are clear links. I can understand spreading and won't hold speed against anyone, but I prefer traditional style debate. 

My judging philosophy is tabula rasa. I'll judge based off of whatever frameworks or weighing mechanisms are provided for me and whatever debaters prove to be the a priori argument. 

Basically, I don't care what you do as long as you argue it clearly enough that it makes sense. Also, please don't be rude to your opponent.
