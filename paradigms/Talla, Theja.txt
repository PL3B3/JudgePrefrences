  About me:

- I debated policy 4 years at James Logan High School, mostly on the circuit
- I now coach and judge for Nueva
Positions:
T and Theory
Outline an abuse story. Defend a world interpretation.
Disad/Case
Weigh worlds. Explain link stories. I will vote on terminal non uniqueness. 
Counterplans
Textual competition usually counts as competition. Win a net benefit. 

The K
Explain the alt. Be extremely clear with framework. Explain the role of the ballot. Embed clash and make comparisons in your overviews. 

Pofo
Be respectful. Arguments in the final focus need to be in the summary, warranted. Weighing should start in the summary. Don't be unreasonably omitting defense in the first summary.

Speaks
If you're good at debate, you'll get good speaks. If you're good for debate, you'll get better speaks (s/o Phoebe Kuo).
