  I debated for four years on the national circuit for Ridge High School. I now coach Poly Prep and Hunter MS.

I believe that the round belongs to the debaters so do whatever you'd like to do. I will say that I am probably a better judge for substance than I am for tricks but that doesn't mean you guys should only read Ks in front of me because I used to read them; a good theory debate is a lot better to watch and judge than an awful K debate. 

The only time I plan on intervening is if racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, or any other type of discriminatory actions are taking place. Other than that, just have fun and be nice! 

Feel free to ask me questions before the round or email me at np1658@nyu.edu.
