  I am a '96 graduate of Harvard Law School and a '92 graduate of Harvard College. I competed in L-D Debate avidly at Syosset High School in NY under the tutelage of Lydia Esslinger. I am an attorney admitted in NY and California. In recent years, my focus has been on business litigation. I am keenly interested in international affairs and look forward to hearing all your ideas about the role of economic sanctions.

Preparation is key.

Thoughtful, well-reasoned arguments are a must. A shallow, hackneyed presentation will not impress.

Civility.

Composure.

Energy.

I will flow, the flow gives the debate structure. But L-D Debates are not won or lost on a simple tally of arguments. Throwaway arguments are just that.

A well-reasoned message, appealingly presented, intelligently defended.

I might add that it is imperative to speak with confidence -- no "up-speak," that annoying tendency of some to finish all sentences as if they were questions...

Best of luck!
