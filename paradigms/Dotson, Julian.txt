  Policy (CX) Debate
Speed : 8/10 without spewing and slurring
Probably one of your most objective judges due to how you handle case strategy. Love the K on Aff, run one or more in your own world, follow the SHITS and stay focused on your goal.
on the Neg handle your business following the flow choosing the right DA or counter plans.
Don't be too mean, but I love cut throat debate. Get dirty.

LD
Speed normal to moderate 7/10
Very traditional. If you use a million files I'm not impressed. Case structure is important and Value clash is vital to the win. Follow flow and argue smart. Speak clearly and remember LD is not the bastard child of Policy.
