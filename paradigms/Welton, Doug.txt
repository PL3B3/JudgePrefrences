  I have coached debate for 7 years. I prefer more traditional LD debate including a strong Value/Criterion debate. I am willing to follow most debates competitors throw out, except counterplans, plans and speed. If you spread, I stop flowing and...you will most likely lose. That being said, I do like a crisp pace. I like a realistic style of debate. ie. something you would see in a public setting. I do flow and like easy to follow debates. Don't bounce around. Signpost. Give clear voters.
