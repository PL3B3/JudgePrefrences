   I'm the director of Speech and Debate at Trinity Valley School. I'm also an instructor in English literature with a Ph.D from SMU, where I did my dissertation work on political theology in the Early Modern period. I worked a lot on Agamben, Badiou, and Girard. 

Speed.
 Talk as fast as you need, but please be careful to separate taglines from cards and to start off at a more normal pace and then build up to full-speed spreading. 

K.
 I wrote my dissertation on Agamben. I love the K. Do it up, but be aware that it's not an automatic winner for me. I will vote against a K (or K Aff) if it's clear you don't know what you're talking about and, as a consequence, can't defend it well. 

Topicality.
 I want to see substantive debates about issues. I'm new to the world of debate and I'm not 100% positive about my debate jargon yet, so meta-arguments about Topicality are going to lose me the more complicated and jargon-y they become. I'd much rather hear you actually argue about the policy/advocacy/K/alt/whatever than argue about whether everyone is playing fair.

CP.
 Consult counterplans suck so hard they threaten to make the solar system collapse into a singularity. The impact is extinction. Don't read consult CPs.

CX. 
Open cross-examination is fine.
