  I'm a parent judge who is in the second year of judging. I judge off the flow, so a well laid out argument with clear value/criterion/contentions and concise voting points at the end is recommended. Arguments must be relevant to the resolution. I donâ€™t care much for esoteric points that do not affirm or negate the issue at hand. Speed is usually not a problem as long as the debater can be clearly understood.
