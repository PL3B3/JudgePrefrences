  Make sure the arguments you are going to be telling me to vote for are well developed, and well founded. I won’t give you impacts just because you say you have then in the rebuttal if it’s the first time they’ve been presented. (ex. Claiming impacts with no previous link story) 

Case: Just debate the flow. If you’re going to just cross apply all your off case show and tell me why the application even work. (links) That way I can either see why it works, or see that you know it works to do this. I would like to see all the Stock issues brought up, but it’s not up to me. If you use terms, use them correctly. (I know what they mean) 
I’m OK with speed. I’m not going to drop my pen when I can’t hear what you’re spewing, you will just run the risk of me not being able to flow as fast as you can speak. 
If putting arguments on MY flow is important to you, slow down a little. 

K/CP’s: I’m ok with any of these arguments IF YOU EXPLAIN THEM WELL. Don’t expect me to be an expert because most of the time I won’t be. Although I debated through High school, I only could do policy one year. I’ve been debating Parli at USU for half a year. None of that will mean that I know your argument, and when I do I want to know the argument, I want to know that YOU know your argument, or I can’t give you anything for it. I’ll NEVER judge intervene, so any argumentation has to be well warranted and explained away. (duh) 

T/Theory: I know these arguments, but show me good shells with voters that actually make me want to vote on one of these arguments. If you’re going to run one of these arguments, yourself and everyone else time by making sure it is a relevant argument, and actually go for it. Please don’t argue abuse unless you can prove that you were abused. 

Um, I think I haven’t told you anything you haven’t already heard or that you wouldn’t expect; just debate.
