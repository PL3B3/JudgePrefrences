  Hi! I debated for Hunter College High School for 4 years and graduated in 2012. I went to VBI for 2 summers if for some strange reason that matters.

Arguments: I will listen to any argument (DAs, CPs, whatever) as long as it is clearly explained and defended. Having said that, I prefer depth over breadth. I won’t vote on one-line blips (even if they’re dropped) or arguments that you didn’t fully articulate in earlier speeches that you then explode. I’ll repeat one more time: DO NOT BLIP. Just don’t.

Speed: Given my experience, I can handle a reasonable amount of speed. But I was never the best at flowing speed in high school and I’m a year removed from the activity, so generally don’t go your fastest. Please slow down for tag lines and author names. I’ll yell “clear” once and only once if I can’t keep up. If you go too fast you run the risk of me not flowing an argument. If I don’t flow an argument, I won’t vote off it. I highly prefer substantive, slow debates to unnecessarily fast ones.

Critical arguments: Never ran them, rarely hit them. I’ll treat them just like any other arguments I hear, but if you start spreading it and I have no clue what the hell you’re talking about, it’s your fault.

Theory: Only run theory if you legitimately think there is no other way to win the round. If I think you ran theory as a way to confuse your opponent, eat up time, or avoid substantial clash, I won’t be happy. Theory should be run as a last-resort, not a strategic tool. I will not discount your theory if it’s clearly extended, but I have a high threshold for voting on theory.

Weighing: Do it.

Speaks: Bringing me food may or may not increase your speaks.

Please don’t take yourself or debate too seriously. The activity should be enjoyable and make you happy, not be a source of stress. Have fun and good luck!
