In general, I will evaluate almost any argument provided that it is well warranted and not abusive by nature.

Framework: Very important to establish, needs to be well warranted. This is very important to setting up the weighing analysis.

Extensions: I won't evaluate arguments that are extended through ink (make sure you respond to the opponent's refutation if you want me to evaluate a given argument). Arguments made in the final focus must have been properly extended throughout the round in order for me to vote on them.

Impact Calculus: Give me concrete weighing analysis, it makes the round very clear if you do the weighing yourself instead of leaving it up to me at the end. 

Speed: Avoid spreading, but I can handle a fast pace if it's clear. Once again, don't spread. 

Speaker Points: I'll award speaker points on how effective the debaters are in the round. This includes presentation but also efficacy with argumentation. 

Feel free to ask me questions before the round if I haven't answered them here.
