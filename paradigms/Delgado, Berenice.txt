  This is my second year debating at CSUF.

Spreading is fine. I don’t count flashing as prep. I’ve done both traditional and critical debate. Do whatever you want, just make sure you have a clear explanation of what your argument is with a warrant. I am not familiar with the high school topic so ultimately it is your job to make sure I understand. I am flow centered. Have a good impact calculus and make it easy for me to know what I should vote on. I enjoy banter and wittiness during cross-x.
