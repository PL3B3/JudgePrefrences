  I debated parliamentary debate in high school for the world schools program for 3 years, and debated at the world schools international championship as Korea's representative.

I am currently an undergarduate at Harvard studying government.

I have very little experience with LD, so count me in the camp of "traditional" judges: slow speed, little-to-no jargon, a very clear articulation of what matters in the round and clear voters in the last speech. 

I will vote for the position that I think was most convincingly articulated and consistently put forward throughout the round. Don't try theory, kritiks, or flow games in front of me; I will ignore them.
