Paradigm:

-no policy speeds for me, you can go bout 250/min and I'm fine but any faster and you might lose me
-any argument you're opponent can't refute is a good argument but I hate time suckers so don't do that
-use cx to make you're opponent admit flaws and tie cx back to your speeches
-I will judge on a morality standard, but still throw me big impacts if you can
