Delivery: Speeches should be delivered clearly and at a conversational speed. Your ability to persuade me is the most important aspect of the round.
Cases: I want to see cases that have a value and criterion and then connect contention level arguments to to this value structure. I vote for the debater that wins the value debate and that wins relevant arguments from the contentions.
Cross-Ex: Please be polite. Ask clarification questions if necessary, but challenge your opponent with tough questions.
Voting Issues: Please provide voting issues in the final rebuttal.
