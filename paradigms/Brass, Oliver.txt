  I think that the affirmative should do something and have an interpretation that gives both sides equal opportunity to win based on pre round preparation and in round execution. I think negatives should respond to the affirmative and tell me why they are wrong. 
K- I probably haven't read the literature base but I have done debate long enough to see most K's. I think an aff's best opportunity for offense is the alternative and generally find rejection alt's to be unpersuasive, the negative needs to go a step further and say what I'm rejecting in favor of and how that occurs from my ballot.
Theory- For me to vote on it I think the argument must be made coherently originally (Link, warrant, impact) then expanded upon and developed by later speeches. Half sentence theory arg that are shadow extended won't cut it . Conditionality is probably fine to an extent but can be done abusively. I generally don't think perf con is a reason to reject the team rather an excuse for the aff to go wild on the perm debate. Agent CP's are okay. Delay/Consult /Review cp's I'm less a fan of but have run/voted for them. 
DA's- yes please, politics, tradeoff etc. I like them.
Case- Case debate is under utalized and a good block can really do some damage by investing time here.
