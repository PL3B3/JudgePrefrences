  I have coached LD debate for 9 years and judged at national tournaments most of those years.

Present clear well-developed arguments. Include theory, warrants and impacts. I can follow most every argument, no real preference if it is well-thought out. Don't try to create ridiculous burdens for your opponent or narrow the argument for your own side. There is plenty of "gray area" in which to make a persuasive argument. Signposting is important to me so that I can follow you.

Respect your opponent, especially in CX. Talking over someone doesn't win the day with me. I've been known to give a loss for rude behavior and speaker points at about 50% normal range for way out there rudeness (normal range is 25-29, rarely a 30).

In the end, have fun with the debate. Show your passion, bring on the humor. It exudes confidence in your position.
