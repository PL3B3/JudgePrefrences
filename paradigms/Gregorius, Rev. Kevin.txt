  I am an argument critic, and will decide rounds based upon which team has put forth the best argument(s). Period.

I very most likely will not read any “evidence” during deliberation unless given a good reason to do so. 
Think long and hard before running a critique. 
I am happy to answer any questions prior to the 1AC if anyone needs clarification.
