  About me:
I’m currently a junior at UCLA and a coach for Dougherty Valley High School. I have experience with all types of debate and am open to all types of arguments. 

CPS Note:
I haven’t judged in 2 years and havent debated in 3 years, so I'll probably be rusty. I will do my best to evaluate the debate as fairly as possible, but please understand that judging is imperfect and highly subjective so be mindful of that.
