  Competed starting in 2008 through various forms of high school debate (LD) and speech (oratory, extemp, etc) on the local Texas and national/TOC circuit. Number one goal of debate is of the educational aspect of this activity. 

Value debates are no longer as meaningful as proving why one achieves both values or supposing an opposing value and proving why you met it better. Standard or criterion/criteria should be set up by the debaters and I LOVE it when folks find meaningful consensus on how important the standard is in relation to the judge making a decision. If this consensus is achieved, there is more argumentation on the resolution that can be done without just saying we are 100% different. Cards and evidence are muy importante. I need a warrant in cards, it can't be a generic repetition of the tagline. I need the specific reason or argument the author is using. I do fact check if I feel cards are being cut inappropriately. 

I don't mind speed but I do dislike excessive spreading. Debate is an educational activity and yes that means public speaking is important. I will give you a break during the 1AR to spread a ton, but after that it's important you include persuasion and priority arguments when making your speeches because I do not appreciate someone spreading to throw 1000 blippy arguments on anything. That's not what this competition is about. 

Have concise voters in your last speeches. Try to "crystallize" or summarize at the end of your speech and not throw voters out randomly throughout speeches. I love mitigation, impact calculus, and all that good stuff.

Underviews are important. Theory is important. Kritiks are important. <---Use them wisely and only if necessary though. I.E. If you claim ground skew for the sake of a quick argument, I am more inclined to believe you want a quick win based on what is not actually real unfairness in the round aka be genuine.
