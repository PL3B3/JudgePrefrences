  I feel that public forum is a style of debate that should be able to be judged by any person. Good arguments are necessary to win any debate, but evidence should be used in conjunction with analytical arguments to help support what you are claiming. I like crystallization in the rebuttals. To weigh arguments you need to put in the work to show me why your arguments hold more weight in the round. This means a lot of impact analysis. In the final focus I feel that voters are especially important because they show the judge what you feel is the most important thing in the round. Overall, public forum debate should be about relevant issues in society. The debaters need to show how their side is better in the real world, and what the impacts of that choice would be. You are always welcome to ask me questions before the round to clarify my paradigm.
