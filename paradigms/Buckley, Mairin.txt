  Attended Hillcrest High School (Utah) and did LD Debate throughout. While debating I enjoyed a traditional style approach, but that is not to say I wonâ€™t vote for progressive cases.
On the V/C Debate: be sure you explain how your value pertains to the resolution, why it is the best value and how your Criterion or Standard upholds that value. This is the framework that I will evaluate all impacts in the round with.
Case Debate: I judge off the flow and will evaluate impacts based on the calculus you give me. I expect solid explanations of the link scenarios and how these result in the impact.
Speed: Be sure to go slower on your taglines and anything you think is really really important for me to flow. I am definitely ok with some speed, but you must be clear.
