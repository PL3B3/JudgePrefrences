  I did LD on the circuit for 4 years at Torrey Pines High School, and I'm currently a sophomore in college (where I do parli). I can handle speed for the most part, but please enunciate words that are important for me to get down (i.e. author names, taglines, etc). I prefer coherent, well thought-out arguments to sneaky ones, but I'll vote on essentially anything. Along the same lines, I don't like theory, except in cases where there is a very clear violation.

The most important thing you can do in round to get my ballot is to impact and weigh everything very clearly. You should tell me how to vote in the NR/2AR, and if you are winning the round, my RFD will probably be exactly what you said in that speech.

Chances are I haven't judged any rounds on your topic before, so don't take it for granted that I know all of the really common arguments.
