  Basically, I'll vote on anything you run just as long as it makes sense and you don't go over my head with your argument. Take caution, however, when you tell me how I should vote. If you don't clearly and fully explain and defend your stance, then I'm more likely to vote for the other side if you don't address major holes in your argument.

That said, I love philosophical implications in debate. They are fun to judge and really engaging to me. I think the more complex they are, the better, but again, don't go over my head. I won't judge what I can't understand. 

I don't really care too much for speed. If you can do it, great! Just be clear. If you aren't, then I'll tell you by saying "clear." If you don't speed, that's not a big deal. 

Besides that, be respectful! Don't stereotype and try not to make emotional appeals. 

And most importantly have fun! If you're not into the debate, then odds are I'm not either. At the end of the day, though, you just do you.
