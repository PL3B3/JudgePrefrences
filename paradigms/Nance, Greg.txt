  I graduated in 2006 from Bainbridge Island High School in Washington where I debated LD for four years.

I prefer to vote off explicitly weighed impacts to the established standard. 

I give speaker points based on clarity (road maps, sign posting, crystallization) and argumentative skill. I prefer reasonable speed but can follow faster, more technical rounds.
