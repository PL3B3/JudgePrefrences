  Fair warning, I started debate in college, so my experience with PF and LD is limited.

I put the most weight on clear and well supported arguments, so please do not spread or talk too fast, because if I can't follow you, I will not vote for you. The debate styles that I do are conducive to lots of analysis on a few arguments, so be sure to go deep into your points and don't say too many things that you can't warrant. Do not overuse debate lingo (e.g. 'cards') because usually when people do this, they are trying to make up for the fact that they can't substantiate their arguments, so if you do this, I may be biased against you. When you present quotes and statistics, always explain why they are relevant to the case framework. If you do not explain how your quotes and stats are linked to the debate, I will not give you points.

Good luck!
