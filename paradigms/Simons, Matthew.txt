  I debated for Carmel High School on an aggressively local circuit for four years and now debate at Columbia in parliamentary style debate. I have some exposure to nat circuit debate through debate camp, but it is minimal. 

I will try my best to evaluate the round based on what arguments are made as long as they are clearly impacted and warranted. I’ll have difficulty following a full spread, but high speed is okay. When first introducing a card, be clear for the tag and author, otherwise I’ll have difficulty following if you refer to the card later. I am very receptive to Ks, Plans/Counterplans, and framework debate so long as they are reasonably relevant to the resolution. I do not enjoy theory debates. 

In regards to speaks, I try to be generous. Extra points awarded for good crystallization and strong weighing/impacting. Carlos Taylor was my lab mentor at VBI so I’m okay with some pettiness, but maybe don’t demand someone be excommunicated from debate. If you intentionally make someone upset I will dock your speaks. 

Make sure your opponent has a copy of your case before the round, otherwise debates become sloppy and it’s no fun for anyone.
