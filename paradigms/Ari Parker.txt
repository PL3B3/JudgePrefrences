  Debaters who establish a clear decision calculus tend to win my ballot. Use even/if stories, weigh, etc.

I understand some basic philosophy but don't consider myself all-knowledgeable about the subject. Run whatever you're best at but understand that the dense your argument, the more time you will need to spend explaining it. If your strategy is to evade and confuse, you will not win my ballot.

Theory and topicality arguments are fine but spend time on the link. Deviating from generic shells and making specific links/standards usually helps. I can't remember ever voting for T is an RVI.

speaks: comparing evidence, generating offensive responsives, and making strategic decisions tend to impress me.
