  My name is Mike and I'm a second year student at Harvard University studying Sociology and Economics.

I have not debated in high school, but understand the basic structure of argumentation and what needs to be weighed in a round. I like intellectual debates and smart arguments, and also feel that I have an above-average aptitude in understanding philosophical concepts fairly quickly. As for speed, I think that debate is about persuasion and not just speaking as fast as possible (as long as you can clearly articulate your words to me, I think you will be fine even if you are going a little fast). Clarity is super important because your opponent and I need to understand what you are trying to say in order to judge/debate you. All in all, although I am very new to the event, I feel that I am a fair judge and will be happy to talk to you to discuss your rounds if you want.
