  I debated on the national circuit for four years (2004-2008) at Grapevine High School (TX). So far this year, I judged at the Grapevine tournament and at the unt camp tournament. The most important thing that you can do in the debate to make me happy is to have lots of impact and evidence comparisons. Having those comparisons in the debate makes my job easier and will help you tremendously. In topicality debates, I defer to a competing interpretations framework. If you plan to go for reasonability, I think you need a clear explanation of what you mean instead of just saying reasonability, listing a few reasons it is good and moving on. I evaluate disads from an offense/defense perspective meaning it will be pretty difficult for you to win a disad debate on just no link and no internal link etc. arguments. It is certainly possible, but just be aware I might be harder to convince than most judges. For kritiks, a focus impacts is also important. Specific link work is nice and important but the impact/alternative debate is the most important part from my perspective. Iâ€™m sure you have more specific questions, so feel free to ask.
