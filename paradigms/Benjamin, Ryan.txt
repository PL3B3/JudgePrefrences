  Background:
I debated in the NYUDL (for MCA) for two years. Once I graduated, I debated for another four years at Lafayette College (Policy LD), where I had some success. I don't really have anything specific so I will just list a couple of things that I like/dislike about some positions that are commonly asked about. Clash and Impact Calc are THE MOST IMPORTANT thing for me, make my ballot as easy as possible!

Topicality:
I would say that I am pretty much on the middle of the here, that is I don't have an AFF/NEG bias. However, I think that is important to mention that I think the T IS ALWAYS A VOTER. I evaluate the T based on the warranted extensions of the standards debate (which is the impact calc of T).

K's
I ran them in High School and College and I do enjoy hearing a K every now and then, BUT I do hate hearing a bad K deabte so just make sure you understand the thesis and make sure your ALT solves for both the K and the AFF!

Theory(Perm/CP):
I have a very high threshold here, that is I do not vote here often. The reason for this is because debaters think that all they have to do is read more reasons dispo is good/bad to win. This is not enough for me. You must impact out these reasons (at the ones you go for). For example, tell me why reciprocity is soooo important to the debate.

Speed:
I can handle speed. I just ask that you are clear on the tags and cites because this is the way you would reference them for extentions and cross applications. This does not mean that I don't listen to the evidence, I do, so no power tagging :)

If you need anything more specific just ask.
