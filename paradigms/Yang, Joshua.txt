  I did PF for four years in high school.

I prefer the line by line and I will try to not do work for the debaters.

MAKE SURE YOU EXTEND ARGUMENTS, AND DO SO CORRECTLY

Weigh your arguments - tell me which arguments matter more and why. Tell me which arguments come first.

Accept policy style arguments - Plans, CPs, DAs are ok

Fairly tab judge. Wonâ€™t vote for arguments that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.

Ask me any further questions before the round starts
