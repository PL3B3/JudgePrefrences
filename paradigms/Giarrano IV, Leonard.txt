  Leonard Giarrano IV
LD Debate Judge
Pine View School (I debated LD for Pine View for four years (2009-2013))
Osprey, Florida

(Just a helpful thing: Both my dad and I are on the wiki, and as you may've noticed, we have the same name. That said, if you've got "Giarrano, Leonard" for your judge at Yale, Harvard, or CFL Nats, I'll be the one in the judge pool.)

Here's my paradigm. I think it's pretty straightforward:

-I have a basic fondness for traditional V, VC, and, Contentions/Impacts cases of course. Even if the round moves to other argument types, taking a creative/unique framework angle to the resolution will always be fantastic.
-But you can assume I'll be able to comprehend the other things you throw at me in the round just fine.
-I have a particular fondness for kritiks.
-I also have a fondness for more philosophically involved frameworks. Traditionally structured advocacies can be really exciting, especially these.
-But I can evaluate theory, plans, CPs, disads, and PICs too if that's how things go. They're just not my favorites.
-Spreading is fine with me. I'll call out "Slow" (and "Clear" for that matter) as needed.

Some particular things:

-Kritiks with vague "reject" alts are good and fine, but let's be honest: they're a little bit lame. Odds are that if you've pieced together enough literature to write a K, you've got some sort of counter-philosophy/mindset/fundamental-philosophy-of-living-thing to use as a substantive alt. Ks generally become a lot cooler/better when the "reject" alts are replaced with meaningful things.

-Links to extinction-makes-us-dead/economic-collapse-makes-us-cave-dwellers/other-"gotta-save-the-entire-world" impacts that're usually in plans, CPs, disads, and the like are usually not that airtight. They're fine and all. I won't not vote for them. But I'm just sayin' that they sketch me out.

-Rounds where entire speeches are dominated by theory make me sad. They're easy to flow and whatnot, but they can get pretty messy, and that makes me sad as a judge for obvious reasons.

-Theory shouldn't be run just because you've got time to read off a shell or two. In my mind, if it has to be a part of the round, it should be interacting with the round. If it's got to be there, make it organic!
