  I've been debating policy for two years now, and never had any experience in high school debate. I usually debate more policy straight-up rounds but I have used K arguments as well. I think debates are done better when debaters express what they are passionate about rather then any average case. Overall I'm really up for any argument, feel free to ask me anything.
