  Though not a former debater, I have been judging LD for the past four years.

Speed - I prefer a moderate pace. If I say 'slow down' our sense of "moderate" is at variance! Please slow down. I will be evaluating you off my flow.

Delivery - Plan on clear signposting, slow down for citations and the points you wish to emphasize. I truly appreciate good delivery.

Debate Preferences - Looking for a traditional debate with V and VC. Listening for good framework, contentions and links that are extended out to 1NR/2AR. Don't forget to present a strong summation, including why I should vote for you. I prefer to judge topics where my position is neutral but if I do have a preference I make every effort to put this aside and judge only on what is presented in the round (so don't forget to tell me).

Speaks - 26-30. I favor 27-30, with 30 being reserved for the truly outstanding. Please be respectful of your opponent as I don't want to drag out the "26".

You have worked hard to be here. Enjoy your rounds!
