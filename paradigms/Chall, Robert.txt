  I debated for three years as a student at hopkins high school in minnesota. As a novice my sophomore year I placed 6th at novice state. Junior and senior year I was on the varsity team and made the rounds on the national circuit breaking at a majority of tournaments I attended, but never earning any bids or major hardware.

I think debates should be focused around the value. 

I am not a big fan of speed, but can certainly handle it as a judge.

I tend to vote for the best looking debater (kidding of course).
