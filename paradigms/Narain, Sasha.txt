  I'm conflicted from MVLA and MSJ. 

General 
1. I will yell clear repeatedly until you finally become clear. 
2. You need to fully explain warrants during argument interaction even if your argument is conceded. I rarely call for cards. 
3. You will lose if key extensions are simply absent from your last speech. 
4. I do not evaluate new NR arguments. If there's embedded clash between the NR and the 1AR, I do not require the 2AR to address that implicit clash. 
5. I hold debaters to how they describe an argument in CX. If your extension of an argument is significantly different from how you explained the argument in CX, you functionally lied in CX about what the argument said. 

I don't have defaults in terms of arguments to the contrary. Theory 1. Spirit over text. 2. I default RVI. I will grant an RVI unless you win offense for RVI's bad. Substance 1. Intuitions matter 2. Truth testing 3. Presumption goes aff. Permissibility goes neg. 4. I default strength have defaults in terms of link weighing. If that fails, it's probability. arguments. 

Speaks 
I to like giving high speaks, especially if you promise not to grill me. 
Other ways to get good speaks: 
Make innovative, original arguments with whatever style you debate 
Finish early 
Be funny 
Be clear
