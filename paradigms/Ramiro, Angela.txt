  I am a first year speech and debate coach at Heritage High School. I did not participate in debate in high school. I teach English and have a general thirst for knowledge. I consider myself well read and can participate in discussions on many different topics. 

I expect the debate to flow smoothly and address the topic fully. I can follow the debate pretty well but if I look up or my pen drops, please slow down. I cannot make a determination if I am not able to follow both debaters arguments. I will base my decision on who sticks the closest to the topic and gives the best explanations for their argument. 

Speaker points will be awarded based on clarity of speech and argument, oneâ€™s behavior toward his/her opponent, and the validity of your argument to the debate. 

Finally, be respectful of your opponent. Body language, facial expressions, and vocal intonations that are perceived as rude or disrespectful will be considered in the final decision.
