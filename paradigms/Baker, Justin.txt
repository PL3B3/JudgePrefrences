  Policy Debate Coach Skyline High School (UT)

OV: Substance in debate rounds should be determined by the debaters. I try to be as tab as possible. That being said, there are certain arguments/practices that specifically exclude the other team, and I won't vote for them. [i.e. sexist, ableist, racist language]

Ks: I'm fine with k's on the negative and/or affirmative. I'm familiar with much of the literature surrounding K's. If it's esoteric or early in the season, be sure to provide clear link and alt scenarios.

T/Theory: This is an area where I don't believe I have a prejudice, but I don't find myself voting on it often. I think voters need to have a specific tie into the round and topic.

Topic bias disclosure (in particular interest to the education topic)
I'm not a K-12 teacher, but I've studied a lot of education theory, and have lots of instruction time. Additionally I've coached high school policy debate for 3 years.


This paradigm is by no means complete or particularly thorough so please ask questions. I won't be offended that you didn't read my paradigm, I'll be happy that you have.
