  I'm a traditional LD judge. I have a strong preference that arguments and evidence be presented to me clearly and in a slower, conversational pace-- speeding and spreading are very strongly discouraged. I value a well-organized case supported by strong empirical evidence. I’m looking for voting issues in the final rebuttals to guide me in writing the ballot. Finally, I want to be given a clear and explicit V/VC system with which I am to judge the round. If the debaters don’t agree on a V/VC system with which I am to weigh their respective cases, I must be convinced of the superiority of one of the systems or shown that a debater’s case can also meet the burdens of his opponent’s system.
