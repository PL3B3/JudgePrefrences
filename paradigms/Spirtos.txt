   Hi 
I'm Mike Spirtos
I coach for Analy High School
I attended The Meadows School and Pinewood School
I debated four years and graduated in 2007

Speed: I'm ok with speed, if it's not clear or too fast i will say so in round once and then drop speaks
Theory: to vote on theory there needs to be demonstrated abuse
Critical positions: they need to be explained really well
Speaks: i give them based upon strat and execution i average about a 27
Don't do anything dumb in round just debate well please
if it's not explicitly extended i am not voting for it
I don't vote for extended one-sentence blips. This is not intervention, because you are not making arguments.
im a pretty chill guy in rounds just dont be rude or yell 

this will prolly be updated more and more but for now good luck
