Judging philosophy:I prefer kritikal arguments, and I don't automatically accept fiat. I hate T and theory. I'm sensitive to problematic rhetoric and representation, but I like hearing weird stuff (the kind of files you usually have as a joke, but aren't really sure when/if you'll ever be able to run). Just make sure YOU understand it before you ask me to understand it. I'm a messy flower, so your signposting and clear tags/cites are important. If you can't spread clearly, I'd rather have you drop an advantage and spend more time making a more complex, understandable argument.
If you are rude to your opponents I will be very cross with you. If you shout over your opponent in CX or show condescension, I will be very cross with you. If you are overbearing to your own partner, I will be very cross with you. I expect a degree of decorum and civility and will drastically lower your speaker points if you are unprofessional in any of these ways
