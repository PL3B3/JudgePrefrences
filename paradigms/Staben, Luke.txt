  I debated public forum for 4 years and this is my first year judging. I have never debated LD before and currently help coach Public Forum debate. I will keep a flow throughout the round and dropped arguments contentions are a huge deal to me

Speed: Keep speaking speed at a moderate speed, maybe slightly above a normal conversation but not my much. Spreading is absolutely not ok. If you spread I will stop flowing because I am not going to truly understand more than bits and pieces of what you are saying.

Value and Value Criterion will only sometimes be a factor in how I decide a round. When doing voters be careful how much time you spend on this because other voters are preferred.

Do not use Kâ€™s as I almost will never vote for them but I do appreciate good plans and counter plans when done effective. With that do not be afraid to use other tricky frame work or tricky arguments because I love those when done effectively. It is not enough to simply say your opponents framework is abusive but rather explain why. I like both statistical and the use of logic in a case. When these are put together effectively that to me is the best case.

Voters: Voters will almost always decide the round for me. I love debaters who crystalize the round throughout. The last speech should be primarily focused on giving good voters.

Other stuff: Be aggressive in CX. While I will not vote solely on CX destroying your opponent in CX will definitely be beneficial
