I am fine with anything, as long as its well warranted and impacted throughout the round.
As a debater I favored the K, I'm not a fan of theory but will vote off of it if the abuse scenario is clear.

Plans, CP, DA, T- all are perfectly fine
Ks- Love a good K, prefer the K to be specific rather than general. Slow down on tags and alts. Dont assume I know every weird philosophy.
Theory- Default competing interps and no rvi. Slow down so I can understand the shell. I prefer abuse thats already happened.

Things I like-
Sass, Specific cases, comprehensive overviews and good roadmaps.

Things I don't like-
Needless hostility, Racism, Sexism, Xenophobia, Polls, Disclosure Theory

Have fun :)
