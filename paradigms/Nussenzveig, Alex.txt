  Debate is a place for you to express yourself, so you do you. As long as your arguments aren't offensive I'm cool with anything you want to do. For some specifics in regards to LD:

Theory: I would prefer a substantive debate but if you really enjoy theory go for it. Keep in mind that if your theory argument takes you 5 seconds to read in your constructive and you go off on it for your whole rebuttal you'll need to do a lot more explaining to get my ballot.

K's: critical debate was my fave in high school, if you read a high theory K in front of me and do it well that'll get you extra speaks. 

Framework: if you read a super dense framework you might need to slow down and explain it a bit more for me because I'm not the most familiar with LD frameworks.
