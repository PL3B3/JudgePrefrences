  I tend to be a straight forward, logic based judge. I have been judging for 10 years and I debated 3 years in high school. I look for sound arguements that pertain to case subject, plus arguements that have warrants and extended reasoning. When it comes to speaking style my judgement varies, as long as the speaker is clear then speed is not an issue.
