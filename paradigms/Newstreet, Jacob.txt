  I recently graduated from Coral Springs High School in Broward County, FL with two years of competing in local circuit LD under my belt. I like to see a road map before each rebuttal. For speaker points, clarity takes precendence over speed, but if you do choose to speak fast then be easily discernible. I don't typically find theory to be convincing and probably won't weigh it in my decision. I do, however, enjoy kritiks and other creative, but topical, arguments. Non topical arguments will be ignored.
