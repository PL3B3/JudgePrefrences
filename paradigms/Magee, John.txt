  I have been judging Lincoln/Douglas debate for about 2.5 years. I have limited experience judging upper-echelon varsity debate.

I do flow the debate, although my flow may not always say what you want it to say. I will do my best to follow you, but cannot handle speedy debate. I have a relatively traditional paradigm but can handle some theory. Please keep your jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy. Speaker points do not reflect quality of argumentation except for extremely offensive positions.

Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
