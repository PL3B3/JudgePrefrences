  I am a parent judged and have 3 years of experience judging Lincoln Douglas debate. 

I am looking for clarity of speech with good definitions on the terms being used. I would like to see logical arguments and good evidence to support your view. I am comfortable with speed as long up to a certain extent.

Do your best in laying out your case and arguments and i will do by best to be a fair and objective judge. I will provide constructive feedback in my written evaluations.
