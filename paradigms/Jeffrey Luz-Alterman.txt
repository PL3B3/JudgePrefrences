  I'm pretty much fine with any kind of argumentation. I have a low threshold for theory but, in the absence of justifications otherwise, I will evaluate discursive arguments first. I'll vote off anything as long as its clearly extended. At the end of the day, I will vote for the debater who makes it easiest for me to vote them up.

With regards to the spread, I'm fine with speed but I've been out for a couple years now, so I'm a little rusty. If necessary, I will call for material after the round.
