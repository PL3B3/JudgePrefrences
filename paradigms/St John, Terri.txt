LD Judge Philosophy: First, this is persuasion; if you spread I will stop writing. Values are most important. No values. No win. It is values debate. Contentions should provide examples to support those values. Don’t try to impress by providing so many sub points that no human can address them all. Prove to me how your values better support your side of the debate, or prove to me how your opponent’s values cannot be achieved, and you should win the debate.
