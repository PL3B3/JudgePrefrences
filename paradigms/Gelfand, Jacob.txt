  I'd like to watch a round where you're debating the way you debate best, unless that involves Ayn Rand. Clash and a clear ballot story are usually helpful. Also, I don't like Ayn Rand. I can answer specific questions about, for example, how I evaluate theory, in person. My average speaker points are probably about Ï€ below Jon Cruz's.
