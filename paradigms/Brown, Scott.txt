TLDR

Disclaimer: I am unabashedly human. I'm not a robot. I get fatigued, moody, hungry, emotional, etc. I'm MENS XXL, not MENSA. I'm weird. Sometimes my decisions vary; I don't think I'm as predictable as other judges. If this turns you off and you don't know me: please strike me.

Freud would say I cannot suppress my Id

If you do not clearly say every syllable of every word, please strike me. Unclear = 25.5 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Slow down; no one can actually flow @350WPM, especially if it's some goopy K schma

I will proactively judge intervene to end a debate if any form of clipping/bad ethics occurs.

Truth > Tech

Team Zero Risk

Team No Judge Kick

Running clock - it's either a speech, cx, or prep

I overwhelmingly dislike judging debates centered around what content should(n't) be allowed

If executed properly, I'm great for conditionality bad and "theory"

I don't get how speaker points work in 2017 - just tell me what you want and I'll (dis)agree.

I'm a part of the debate. It is not uncommon for me to say something or comment during CX. I don't have a "debater poker face". I nod along if I get what you're doing, laugh at jokes, smile, give perplexing looks if I don't get what you're saying, etc.

I flow on a laptop. I flow in lots of small cells rather than a few big cells. I use a double check method with 2A/NR. I normally decide fast.

Some teams that I have particularly enjoyed judging: Beacon DF, Kinkaid RT, Niles West CK, Pace CK, Pace ES, Westminster AT, & Woodward SS.

Some judges that I enjoy judging with: Daryl Burch, Shunta Jordan, Matt Malia, Mike Shackelford, jon sharp, & Stephen Weil.

If you insult my sports civic pride, it better be the best damn joke of your life.
