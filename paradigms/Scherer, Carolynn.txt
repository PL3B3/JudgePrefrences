  Carolynn Scherer - Judging Philosophy

Debating can be fun. I like to see strong logic, and consistency. I prefer argumentation which supports the claims stated with strong and appealing evidence. I want to clearly hear the analytic arguments. I prefer the debaters not spread. I like to see debaters summarize their voting issues in the rebuttals.

This year's debate topic is timely and stimulating. Given my scientific background, I hope arguments dealing with alternate energy are founded on scientific protocol. I look forward to enjoying my time listening to these debates.
