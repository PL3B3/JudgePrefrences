  I did LD at Barrington High School for four years on both the local and national circuit and qualified to TOC my senior year. I am currently a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin. I have not been involved with debate at all since the end of my senior year so please slow down and err on the side of over explaining arguments and their implications( especially since I probably am not very familiar with the topic lit or the new trends in LD.) As far as preferences go, I always hated judges that had a strict interpretation of the way debate was supposed to look like and to be honest I don't really care what style or way you choose to debate just don't be an ass and have fun.If you have any specific questions, message me on Facebook or just ask me before round.
