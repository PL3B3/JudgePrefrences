I'm Vikram. I debated for Edgemont in high school and Northwestern in college.
I don't feel too strongly about much. If your arguments aren't morally abhorrent you should be good 2 go \('-' )]

That said, here are some thoughts. 
---T and theory arguments can be necessary at times, but more often than not strike me as trite and boring.
---If you rly wanna directly impact turn all instances of stopping suffering/preventing death... fine but I promise u your life Doesn't Have to Be This Way
---Heated indignation is fine and perhaps inevitable; know-it-all snarkiness isn't; ideally pleas don't do the second one
