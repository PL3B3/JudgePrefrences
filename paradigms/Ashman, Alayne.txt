  I will start of by saying that I am more so of a traditional policy judge so I like the traditional debate.
 
 
Theory - I will always evaluate theory arguments first with in the round. This tells me in general how to evaluate the rest of the round.
 
Kritiks – I am not a fan of the K’s But I will vote on them if there are explained very well with in the round
 
Speaking/ Speed – I am fine with it but make sure that I can understand you. If you know that you are not clear when going fast then, do not go fast my approach is if I do not catch it to flow it do not get mad. Tip let me get use to your voice before you take of off.
