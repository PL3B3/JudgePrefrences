   This is my tenth year in LD. I have competed, judged, coached at all levels, and worked at different summer institutes. I love how much LD has evolved, and the metalanguage of debate that has found its way into rounds. As for voting, I will do what debaters ask when they give voting issues. I am open to voting on any issue as long as it is adequately weighed and explained in the round. This means topicality, prestandards overviews, performative criticisms... most anything. I will not vote for something that is new in the last speech, however, or isn't well enough explained the first time I hear it (in the AC for instance, instead of the 2AR). I have also voted against at least one person for being exceptionally rude in round. The reason for this is the same as if I were to vote against someone who was using racist, sexist, or homophobic language: debate is a sphere where arguments and rationality should be valued, not intimidation.
