  I debated for four years at Southlake Carroll in Texas, graduating in 2009. I competed both on the local and national circuit, so stylistically speaking, you can debate in the manner that best suits you.

Speed is generally not a problem for me, as long as you are being clear. However, I do believe that speed for speed's sake is both unnecessary and ridiculous, so if you are planning on going fast, make sure that you are not sacrificing quality for quantity.

In terms of the arguments themselves, I expect both debaters to make impacts back to a weighing mechanism. Whether this weighing mechanism is a criterion, burdens, standard, etc. is up to you, but I do expect you to link your arguments clearly and offer comparative analysis about your arguments in the context of the round.

I will vote for theory if there is demonstrated abuse, but I do tend to be lenient if there is a sound and reasonable response to the violation.

Also, respect is key. I will not hesitate to dock you on speaks if you are being rude or condescending.
