  I did circuit LD debate for the four years I spent in high school. I was okay I guess.

I don't like theory. I mean, if you have to, go ahead, but honestly try to avoid it.

One time someone read determinism in front of me, and the other guy stole my ballot, so while that guy was gone I went to his laptop and stole all of his backfiles for the topic. I thought it was pretty funny but the tournament director didn't. So I'm just saying, don't steal my ballot. Or if you do, it is predetermined that I will have access to all of your arguments as a result.

This topic is pretty heavy. Don't be an asshole. Be classy and smart.

You all start with 27s and you'll go up and down from there. I will give perfect speaks to anyone who can successfully use a lyric from Meatgrinder by Madvillain. Successfully is to be determined by me, in context of the round. Note: if you do this but mess up considerably in the rest of the round you won't get perfect speaks at all.

All link stories should be so clear that I don't have to do any iota of work for you while I make my decision. If I have to, I'm not likely to look to the argument as a reason to vote for you.

I'd like to be entertained. I'd prefer to hear positions that aren't stock. But I mean, read what you're comfortable with. I'd rather see a boring skilled debate than a mistake-riddled critical one.

I can flow okay. If you aren't clear I guess I'll let you know, but at the cost of your speaker points.

Don't be mean or I'll nuke your speaker points.

Have fun good luck.
