  Disclaimer: I have not judged a debate on this topic yet and I do not coach a team so do not presume I know anything about your arguments. 

Experience: I debated 4 years in high school and I am in my 3rd year at Baylor.

General thoughts: you do you and I will do my best to adjudicate. I like to think that I'm not too ideological and am open to a variety of different debate styles.

Things I like: evidence comparison. I've never been persuaded by the 13th uniqueness card. I don't particularly enjoy reading cards at the end of the debate (but I will) so the more evidence comparison you do, the better you will do. 

Things I hate: prep stealing. Don't do it. I also hate how long people take to flash/email evidence. Don't be slow. Do not presume I will time your prep. That's your job.
