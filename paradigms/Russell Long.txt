  I debated in High School for Round Rock. Debated in college for Texas State University for both CX and Parliamentary. I have experience in judging high school rounds for 5 years now. Right now I am helping to coach Round Rock High School. 

I'll be straight, I like watching policy rounds more than the K, but, that being said I can still evaluate the K. Just know that if you run it in front of me, my threshold for voting for it might be higher than other judges. 

Topicality is essential for the topic, but, I am not likely to vote on potential abuse, I'm going to want to see how the Aff's interpretation of the resolution is bad for you. 

DO NOT PERFORM IN FRONT OF ME. If you want to play music, sing, dance, whatever go find another activity, the best way to lose in front of me is to do this.

In terms of counterplans and those types of arguments, I don't mind if you run them, or how you run them, unless you try running multiple conditional counterplans. This doesn't mean that you will automatically lose, but, if the other team cries abuse and has good enough theory, you are likely to lose the round. Running a K and a CP is fine as well, but, try to avoid linking to your own K, a good aff arguing abuse or whatever on this point is likely to get my vote, I really dislike negation theory.

Anything else just ask me before the round, I'm more than willing to discuss all this.
