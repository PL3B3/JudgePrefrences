  I was in Cx in high school and I now debate for the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO).

When it comes to debate i'm pretty much a tab judge but i have my preferences....

- I like critical debate. if you know how to run it and can proove a legit link and mpx to the round then your doing good in my book. Watch out about double turning your self in round (i.e. running fem and saying something sexist) if you do i'll be forced to ignore the k.
- I enjoy a good framework debate.
- I will evaluate T and theory. I don't like time suck args but what must be done must be done and i won't punish you for running them.
- I don't mind Cp's and Da's, but their not my favorite to listen to.
- I won't do your work on the flow, always extend though the round!
- tell me why i want to vote for you
- i don't care if your going 300 words a minute or 30, just make sure to be clear and articulate what your saying


and finally, make sure to respect your opponent. in other words please don't be a jerk.
