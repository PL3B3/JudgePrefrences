Kritik: I can follow and am not totally against them, but you should actually clash and/or expand impacts if doing so.

Spreading: Ok, would prefer if not.

Conduct: I don't really care if you're casual as long as you keep it professional. Don't be rude. Aggression will be measured as passion or rudeness depending on circumstance.

Open CX is fine, but both teams need to agree on it before the round. If only one speaker is dominating, that will be factored in.

Flow judge for all intents and purposes. Will weigh on the line by line as well as case arguments. I like to hear clear and definite voter issues. Don't make me think for you, explain to me clearly.
