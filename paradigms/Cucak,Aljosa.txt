Debated 3 years at Roosevelt High School, Sioux Falls, SD
debated on the national circuit quite a few times during my career.
judged 0 debates on the topic - so up to you to teach me what is and is not topical.

Overview: I mostly debated policy arguments while in high school, also ran Ks and Kritical affs. I know most popular Ks, and am willing to listen to pretty much anything. I will vote on framework but not leaning aff or neg on framework. speed is ok, just don't start at mach 1 right away build it up a little, slower and persuasive is better in the later speeches I will read evidence if it becomes an issue in the round. if you want more info look below.

T - I like good T debates especially if they are used strategically. 1 T is good, 2 is alright, 3 don't do it unless you have a good reason.

DA/CP - I like them, you can run them, Condo if fine with me.

K - I read them, I'll vote on them just make sure you give a really good explanation on the Alt and answer the perms. Make sure you understand the K you are reading really well and explain it, because if you don't I might not either.

Theory - Be especially slow and clear, I have a high threshold for voting on theory
