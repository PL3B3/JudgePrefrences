High School Debate Experience: 4 years

Background:
I have experience in LD, PFD, Congress and Extemp. I focused primarily on Congress and Domestic Extemp, competing at Nationals for both.

Speaking Preferences:
Spreading is fine. I'll make it clear if I cannot understand you.

Argument Preferences:
I am open to any argument that you’re willing to use. Be sure to be logical and spell everything out. Assume I have little prior knowledge about what you’re speaking of. Signpost, explain your cards well, adequately defend your arguments, address all of your opponents arguments, and you’ll be in pretty good shape.

Flow:
I will be flowing the round.

Winning:
It is not enough to just present good arguments. They must be adequately developed, explained, and defended throughout the round. Weigh impacts and be persuasive.

Point Breakdown:
30: Fantastic! Absolutely stand-out abilities from speaking skills to creative analysis. The round was organized, simple, clear-cut, and enjoyable to follow.
29: Great! Very strong ability - Eloquent, organized and easy to follow analysis. Only a few minor stumbles or drops.
28: Above average - good speaking ability; may have dropped a needed argument, but compensated with speaking skills, or strong analysis, but weaker speaking skills.
27: Doing well - speaking well and functioning well in the debate, but some points may have been dropped or underdeveloped.
26: Seems to be struggling - there is either a lack of logical arguments, substance or weaker speaking skills. An important error may have been made.
Below: Extreme difficulties in functioning; Very large difficulty in filling time or rude/offensive behavior.
