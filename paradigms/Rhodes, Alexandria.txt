  I competed in LD and Public Forum in high school. I have since judged a couple of times for various tournaments.

I will flow the round. The most substantial arguments should be debated; dropped arguments, however, should be avoided. In other words, I will note a dropped argument as a cession to the opposite team. Additionally, please remember to debate the value/standard in the round--don't get bogged down by other lesser arguments. The final speeches, of course, should be summaries of the debate thus far; no new arguments need be advanced.

Your delivery should be effective and persuasive. Please do not speed read, but instead use a normal (or slightly elevated) speed, a conversational manner of speaking, as it were. Whatever your style of oral delivery, I should be able to understand you easily. This also means that debaters should be respectful to each other. I will penalize you for anything less.

Lastly, your arguments should be convincing. I accept evidence in all its forms, but I would prefer not to have a "battle of the quotes."
