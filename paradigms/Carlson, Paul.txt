  I am open to all different kinds of arguments, basically, you should tell me explicitly in your speeches what I should be voting for and why. Recent and credible evidence is weighted heavily, but the argument should be yours- using the evidence to back you up. Every debate and every resolution has a different strategy, so there is no “magic bullet” argument to me. Different arguments will work differently in each round. 

Please keep in mind that I am not a policy debater- I know LD well, but policy debate methods won’t work for me in rounds. This also means that some spreading is okay, but you need to be understandable and you need to signpost really well.
