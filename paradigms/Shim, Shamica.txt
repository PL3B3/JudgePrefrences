  I competed in LD for Fort Lauderdale High School for 4 years and judged for 3. 

I'm open to fast and clear debate. I will vote on arguments that are linked to a standard and sufficiently impacted, either through a criterion or through some kind of framework. Otherwise, I will have to vote on the impact analysis of the argument. 

Theory: Must be impacted and well warranted. DO NOT use theory if there is not clear abuse or as a time suck. 

I'm also open to less-traditional LD debate.
