  Hello!

I am a proud coach at Coon Rapids High School in Coon Rapids, Minnesota.

I am old school. Hence, have a value and use it. I like a standard so I know how to weigh the round.

Feel free to ask me questions. I do not like a lot of speed nor theory arguments. I like tater tot hot dish and criteria debate.

Strike me if you dare...
