  Debate Judge Experience: 3 years
Preference: Traditional; however, accepting of theory and counterplans - if they do not impugn the integrity of the debate. With respect to speed (or spreading), if it conflicts with clarity (my perception), it is a major deduction. 
Focus: Logical consistency of framework and contentions; ability to explain the relevance of value criterion; clarity of exposition in rebuttals; clash and extension of frameworks and contentions; summation that reflects 
understanding of key concepts; respect for participants, the resolution, and the debate process.
