  I did LD at Hillcrest High School (Utah) and have experimented with both the traditional and progressive side of things.
I look for thought provoking discussion on the Value/Criterion debate and use this as the platform for weighing all arguments in the round.
On the case debate links and impacts are equally important, defense and offense must be combined to be most effective.
Speed is fine.
Theory and K is acceptable, but be sure to fully explain the argument. Donâ€™t assume anything about my ethical or theoretical framing, tell me why the criticism or violation is of the upmost importance and also how/why I must vote on it.
