Background 
I am coach of the Winters Mill speech and Debate Team in Westminster, MD. Our team was founded in 2007 and has been nationally competitive in Public Forum Debate since this beginning. My background is in Government & Politics as well as Economics. 
 
Philosophy 
First and foremost I am a PF Debate purist in that I believe it should be what it was intended to be – lay person debate. If you want to talk fast and ignore your opponent try Policy. If you want to use jargon, call out dropped arguments, and refer endlessly to cards try Lincoln Douglas. PF Debate is intended to be debate that is accessible to the common person with no debate or topic background. With this in mind the easiest way to lose my ballot is to spend the round referring to “cards,” “topicality,” and “burdens.” 
 
My idea of a good debate is one in which both teams present clear arguments that have a commonality to draw the case together. Evidence should be used to SUPPORT argumentation not make it. In other words, evidence should be used to build your analysis not to be it. I want to hear what you believe regarding the topic not what the Heritage Foundation believes. Another means of losing my ballot is abusive debate. Treat your opponents with respect at all times as well as the judges. Do not tell a judge what to do (“you must…”) and do not insult or misrepresent your opponents. The final way to lose my ballot is Crossfire. It should be an open, CIVIL exchange of ideas not a shouting match. If you are yelling or cutting your opponent off you will lose my ballot. 
 
In summation there are four things you should do to gain favor on my ballot: 
1) Be clear in argumentation 
2) Be courteous and polite in the round 
3) Utilize evidence only is support of your arguments 
4) Have a clear logical case progression 
5) Stay true to the resolution
