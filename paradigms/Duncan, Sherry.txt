  I have been coaching for 25 years. I really enjoy this activity.

Policy - I will accept speed, but I prefer slowing down for the tag lines and explanations. I love extending arguments all the way through. I will accept all, counterplans, case arguments, kritiks, and Perms. Computers can be frustrating, plan on using your prep time for problems.

LD - I am very traditional, but will understand the cases of progressive debate. I am very much so into value and criteria. This is a communication activity and I love good argumentation.
