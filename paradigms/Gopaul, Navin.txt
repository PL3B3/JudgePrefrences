-I haven’t judged much so I won’t pretend I have strong biases towards or against certain arguments. You should feel comfortable reading anything you'd like in front of me – I have read arguments from heg/econ affs to 1-off K strategies/planless affs. That being said, I believe some degree of bias towards certain arguments is inevitable for any judge, which I’ll elaborate on below.
-I don’t have much knowledge of the topic so please be clear (especially with acronyms)
-If you have a speech impediment, see the “speaker points” section
-I’ll probably be updating this as I judge more rounds
-I’m willing to vote on cheap shot arguments but you have to impact it sufficiently throughout the round. I believe if arguments such as ASPEC, OSPEC, RVIs etc are really as silly as people claim then you should be fully capable of answering them
Case
-Lots of advantages don’t make a lot of sense and can be sized down with smart analytics – try to take a step back and think about the aff – (ie do you know how much has to go wrong for nuclear war to actually happen?)
-beating an aff team on their own case is a major ethos appeal for me
-impact defense is your friend
Disads
-I find analytics a strong tool against disads. Many of them don’t make sense so take a second (or minute) to think about it.
-Link probably controls the direction of uniqueness, but I can be convinced otherwise
-The politics disad probably isn’t intrinsic but I’ll evaluate this debate based on the arguments in the round.
CPs
-Specific CPs vs. an aff is great
-I’m down for cheating cps as long as you justify it – though I tend to lean aff on questions of competition
Ks
-I’d probably enjoy a topic specific K the most, but if you must go generic then try to apply it well to the aff
-I’m familiar with most generic Ks. For something more complex it would be in your best interest to slow down and use less jargon
-I’m willing to vote on dropped K tricks
-I’m more a fan of a team that spends less time reading evidence and more time explaining their cards and applying it to the aff
-Aff vs the K – your best bet is winning the truth of your aff and your ability to weigh it. Choose a strategy and stick with it. I’m down for heg good versus an imperialism K or cap good vs a cap K – if you link, just accept that you link and go for the impact turn.
T
-try to contextualize what the topic looks like under your interpretation
-since I haven’t judged a great amount of rounds on the topic, try to make it as clear as possible (which includes going slower)
-reasonability vs competing interps is up in the air for me
Theory
-Most theoretical arguments are probably a reason to reject the argument not the team unless you can explain why a certain practice hindered your overall strategy.
-I lean aff on questions of competition on consult/conditions/delay/XO/nice-aff-i’ll-take-it CPs. (aff teams, don’t let them get away with murder)
-Condo bad – went for it a fair amount and I’m willing to vote either way
-I’m willing to listen to nontraditional theory arguments – ie topical CPs bad
Non-traditional/plan-less Affs
-I believe these types of affs are important for many reasons but at least try to relate it to the topic
-I’m willing to vote on framework vs. these affs
-I’m undecided on the question of whether or not performance based affs have access to a permutation – it can be argued that the function of a perm is to decide whether or not two policies are mutually exclusive not performances. However, if this argument is true then the debate could become very similar to “plan-plan” which is arguably irresolvable.
Speaker points
-I’ll probably give you above average points
-As someone with a speech impediment in debate I know how much it sucks when it comes to speaker points since it’s something you have very limited control over and can really screw up your performance. If you have a speech impediment, find some way to let me know (email me, tell me if you see me in the hallway before the round) and I will do my best to ensure it doesn’t affect my perception of you or the points I assign you.
Cheating
Don’t do it. I’d hate to find myself in a situation where I have to decide something like this. If you are going to accuse someone make sure you have sufficient evidence to back up your claims.
