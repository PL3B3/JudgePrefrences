Policy Debate
Speed: About a 5-6 on a 10 point scale. Slow down on tags; make sure they are clear. I want to flow you, but if your delivery is poor I can't get your argument down.
I don't appreciate multiple worlds, philosophically inconsistent advocacies, or performative contradictions.
Topicality: I find I vote on T only about 10% of the time its run. If you're going to go for it, I recommend you do an impressive job on the standards debate throughout the round.
On Case is where its at! Show me you've done your prep work and really engage with the Aff's proposal.
Off Case:
DAs: I think commodity DAs are lame but I'm open to pretty much any other DA. I actually enjoy a good Politics debate as long as you have good links.
CPs: I love a good counterplan debate but please slow down for the plan text, particularly for PICs.
Ks: Look, if I don't understand the link or the alt, I'm just not going to vote for your K. Also, when your tags take up multiple lines of text, I can't flow them... Slow down! Explain, explain, explain. 
Last comment: You probably want to do the comparative work for me or else I have to intervene, which you may not like.

LD
More traditional LD judge. Please no metaethics, please. Going to run generic off case? Sure, but you better have super solid links. You should be winning on both the framework flow and the contention level. See my comments about speed in the policy section.
