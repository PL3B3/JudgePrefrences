Debate is a chessboard and nothing is set in stone except the pieces you give yourself

Prep
 
Prep stops after you have removed the flash drive and handed it to the other team. 
 
Kritiks
 
I am not a fan. I expect a lot of explanation and find buzzwords unpersuasive. You can win the game of debate on them though…but not on a 1AR drop. Also the capitalism bad critique is not a coherent argument.


Counterplans
 
Solvency advocates not needed. 
 PICs are awesome. And vague plans can be beaten by a smartly worded PIC. 
 Consult or process counterplans questionable although I believe they probably are competitive although easily defeated.
 
Theory
 
Conditionality – neg I don’t see why you limit yourself at two, once you go past one go all the way
Aff – most neg teams are bad at conditionality go for it, just don’t be stupid and go for 2AC time “skew”
Topicality – Competing interpretations is best. Cult of limits is silly but limits in general are probably good. 
 Framework – Affirmatives should defend a topical plan. If you don’t defend a plan and the negative goes for framework you will lose. 
 
Disads
 
Always good – should try to be specific
 Theory arguments such as intrinsicness and vote no are unpersuasive unless debated well.
 
Case
 
I put this last only because many of you are too lazy to actually cut a caseneg and probably will just read impact defense. Why do neg teams limit themselves to only impact defense? Please cut casenegs and beat the aff on their own turf. Your speaks will be rewarded and I will be happier.
 
Other Things
 
Be aggressive but not a jerk
 Look at me
 Use headphones if you are going to listen to music before the round
 I will time your cards and ask for speech docs if I think you are clipping.
 If I seem disinterested don’t worry I am still listening
