Background

I am a current junior at Monte Vista High School (CA), and have been competing in LD since my freshman year. I have qualified to NFL Nationals twice, so I have more experience with that style more so than circuit style debate. However, I've competed in a number of circuit tournaments as well, so I am familiar with a variety of debate styles.

Speaking Preferences

Speed: You are free to speak quickly so long as you enunciate and I can understand what you're saying. That being said, my capacity to understand speed is probably lower than the average judge on the national circuit. You don't have to be conversational, but your maximum speed is likely too fast for me to pick up everything. I'll do my best, but if there's something you absolutely need me to hear, slow down.

Argument Preferences

Case Structure: I prefer a traditional value/standard case structure, but I'll be receptive to any type of case you have, so long as (1) I understand what arguments you're trying to make, (2) you're organized in how you present them (number your arguments, clear taglines, etc.), and (3) explain how your arguments mean that I should vote for you.

Most important things: Impact your arguments, and give clear voting issues in your final speech.

Please ask me if you have additional questions.
