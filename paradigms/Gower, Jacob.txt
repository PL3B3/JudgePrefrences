  I debated 4 years for Lafayette High School in Lafayette, Louisiana and 4 years at Louisiana State University. I debated in smaller, more regional circuits, but I experienced more than my fair share of success in both high school and college.

It is difficult to say that I have a specific paradigm. I would like to believe that I am open to any line of argumentation; however, if I had to typify my preferences, I would consider myself a big fan of case argumentation. I am impartial to critical arguments...but I'm not the most versed in post-modern thought. Procedurals must articulate a clear abuse story.

i love shady arguements and am likely to vote on them if i hear a likable story.
