  I Debated at Edmond north high school for 4 years and now participate at UCO and debate there. 


I am a very open judge if you read it and run it well I will vote on it.

T 
I think it is a procedural and will evaluate it first. 

FW.
I think this is a real argument and if you win FW I will vote for you. If it is a Kritikal aff. I def think that if the aff says that there is no topical version of the plan then the neg wins. just make good arguments if you are a Kritikal team on FW 

DA - I think these debate are not as fun to judge but that is what i understand the best. 

CP - they are cool to if you have a super specific CP that would be amazing. With a nice Net Benefit. 

K - I am completely open to the K. Although, I have not read a lot of the literature I can still pay attention to the debate. I definatley think there is room for high school students to teach college judges a thing or two.

Speaker Points - I am not a point fairy. I think that if you are good at debating you should be a good speaker as well and I give points way. 

A great speaker will get anywhere from 29-30
A average speaker will get 28.5-29
A below average speaker will get 27-28.5
Everyone else below.
