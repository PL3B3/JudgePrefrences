   I am a parent judge. I have judged regional and circuit debates. Weigh your arguments. 
I do not like excessive speed. Especially slow down on taglines/author names. Be ready to present a paper copy if needed which will be returned immediately after debate. If I didn’t catch what you said in your case the first time, it is a new argument when you bring it up in your next speech. Theory, K’s, plans/counterplans etc. are fine. However it is your job is to explain to me how your advocacy is sufficient to affirm/negate. Make sure your links are well explained. I do not give out results.
