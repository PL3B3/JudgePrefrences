  This is my ninth year judging debate, after my own stint as a Lincoln-Douglas and classic debater.

I previously attended Eastview High School and am also an assistant coach there.

In debate rounds, I expect a clear thesis to be presented in the constructive and defended throughout the round. Arguments must be linked to your own thesis, your opponent's thesis, or the standards for the round. Similarly, I expect these to be the issues discussed as part of your closing statements, and am impressed by debaters who demonstrate a clear knowledge of the topics which were central to the round.

Effectively using your time to make multiple arguments to your opponent's case is impressive, but I don't appreciate a "shotgun" approach to refutation, arguments should have depth and complexity, and I expect the debater to point out their significance. While I'm perfectly capable of flowing speedy debaters, my expectation is that one's speaking style is clearly articulated and persuasive, above all else. Debaters who neglect their role as a speaker in favor of a perceived strategic advantage will be sorely disappointed.

I'm impressed by insightful cross-examination questions, an articulate speaking style, and a firm grasp of the central issues in a given round.
