  I am a truly tabula rasa judge. I can understand anything you want to run. I can deal with speed, any debate theory, etc. Tell me how to vote and make my job easy. If you do not do this, then I usually default to impact calc as a way to weigh the round. Feel free to ask me specific questions before the round starts. I am a very laid back judge, so don't act like I am scary.
