Topicality is key. A rock solid argument with no relation to the current topic is pointless. I favor a few quality, strong arguments over many weak arguments. One or two strong arguments that are well presented and well defended are more convincing than many arguments that do not hold up to scrutiny.

While specific examples can strengthen and clarify a point, the opposition can generally provide an example fitting within your context that disproves your argument.

I can judge any speed of debate, keeping in mind that more words may not aid an argument when a concept can be explained succinctly.
