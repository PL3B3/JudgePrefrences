years judged college : 3tournaments this year: 10rounds judged: 40+This is the last tournament of the year and you are the ones debating, not me. Off the top 
of my head I can’t think of any argument or style of debate that I will refuse to listen to or 
vote on, except if there is a clear objection that is voiced during the debate about an 
argument that is particularly offensive or demeaning. That being said, you should say 
what you want to, and I will not dismiss any genre of argument based on my own 
predispositions. Other things to know: 
--Every argument has a counter argument, and if you don’t want me to default to my own 
opinion of “that makes sense to me,” you need to be clear about defending and weighing 
those two choices. 
--I appreciate good case debate, and in my opinion those are the best and most enjoyable 
debates to listen to. 
--Theory arguments need to be explained beyond a string of 50, 3-word blips that don’t 
get hashed out until the last two rebuttals. 
--I read cards after the debate if I need to, but I won’t use the warrants in the cards to 
make arguments or connections for you. That is your job. 
--I will vote on critical arguments, and I read them frequently when I was debating. But 
know that the past few years I have been working in Washington DC in a district where I 
have heard very few of them, I have not personally read/heard any of the new literature 
on these issues, and my work in politics has kept me focused on researching a more 
“policy oriented” view of the past two topics. Framework debates are also essential as to 
how I evaluate these arguments and how they function during the debate. 
--A good CX is a factor in assigning speaker points.
