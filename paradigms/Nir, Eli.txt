  Just a little bit about me: I am a freshman at the University of Florida studying Computer Science and Economics. I debated for three years in LD in high school for Cypress Bay.

You can ask me any clarification questions you want before the round

I ran mostly kritics in high school. I have more experience with some more basic Ks. I ran baudrillard my senior year at Bronx. That’s the most complicated I got. 
Explain your K’s well. I won’t vote off of it if you just assume I know what you’re talking about and don’t explain how it functions within the round.

I’ll vote off theory, but that was not my forte in high school. I’ll assume theory first, but will vote of K before theory if you make good arguments for it.

I’ll vote off anything that isn’t disrespectful. 

Spreading: Do it, don’t do it, I don’t care. I haven’t done circuit debate since January 2017, so if you’re going to go super fast just flash me the documents. SLOW ON TAGS and go a little slower when you are spreading analytics. 


Speaker Points: I won’t give out 30s like they’re nothing but I won’t tank your speaks unless you do something really disrespectful. Speaker points are unnecessarily arbitrary, and the 4-2/5-2 screw is terrible. I’ll prob give anything between 27.5 and a 29.5. Over 29.5 is if I think you should be able to win the tournament. 

Blue Key 2017 is my first time judging varsity.
