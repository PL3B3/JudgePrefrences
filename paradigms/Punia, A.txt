  Background: I won TOC and NFL when I was a freshman, so I’m pretty much the shit around here. Shout out to my home boy Jay-jizzle for sticking with me
Paradims:
I am a flow judge, speed is not a problem, just remember this is not a reading contest make logical and sensible arguments (ex. DeDev). Make sure you don’t sound like you are having a seizure while you spread.
K= Kritiks (why the hell are they spelled like that???) are fine with me as long as you make it understandable and don’t pull some “Plan discriminates against Gingers, leads to the ontological representation on a toilet.” I lean towards policy framework and policy arguments (ex. DeDev).
Case= If you say rapping is necessary to prevent racism, good luck. If you pull some hypercritical no plant text bullshit, I will probably tell you to stop whining and run a legit case. My favorite cases this year have got to be SBSP, Water Infastrucutre, and Mexico Fence aff. Favorite author is probably Vishal Venkantramen ,his asteroids card was amazing and helped me win many rounds.
Theory: Probably won’t vote on it unless like 4/5+ conditional advocacies or if you drop it.
DA’s: I like a good ole obscure DA as long as its not some Ports kill cockroaches which are key to marine ecosystems which risks extinction. Look into something more sensible like DeDev.
Also, I vote on eye-contact.
