  I am the coach of Taravella High School. I am more of an interp coach and mainly judge that. I will not be able to follow spreading very well. Make sure that your points are clear and that I can understand them. However, just because I can't flow spreading doesn't mean that you should dumb down your arguments for me. I don't like arguments such as moral skepticism or theory but if those arguments are necessary then I will vote for them.
