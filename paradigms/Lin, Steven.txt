  I have competed in speech and debate all four years of high school. I debated for Leland High School in San Jose. I debated in policy for 2 years both in league tournaments and on the circuit. Placed 2nd at SCU open policy and have attended Grapevine, MLK Invitational, Stanford, and Berkeley. I attended Michigan Debate camp for policy debate. I debated in public forum my junior year and received a wild card at the local league tournament. Even though I never debated in LD, I was coaching several LD debaters on their speeches and am fairly well versed in LD format. In my senior year of high school, I would practice drills with one of my good friends Laith Shakir, who turned out to be the national champion. I was mainly a national extemp speaker, where I was top 10 in CA in 2011 and was in the top 30 national extempers for national extemp at Nationals in 2013.
