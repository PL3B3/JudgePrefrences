I will pretty much vote for anything as long as you tell me what to vote on and it’s well developed and extended throughout the round. I'm comfortable with almost any argument but make sure to explain well in rebuttals. Impact calculus is important.

I did a lot of case, CP and DA but I am also familiar with Critical arguments:

Case- I'll vote for what you tell me, extend key arguments and impacts, cross apply arguments from case to answer neg arguments. Have clear solvency and a story line on how the plan solves the harms.
CP- Have a clear net benefit that convinces me that the CP is better than the plan.
DA- Have really good impact calc or why the DA turns the case.
K- Have a clear Alternative and the role of the ballot. Make sure to be clear and explicit separating framework and the arguments on K proper.

Be clear during your speeches and polite to your opponents. Make sure to explain you’re arguments well since I’m not familiar with all the specific arguments from this year’s topic. Have a lot of clash and make sure to sign-post and go line by line.
