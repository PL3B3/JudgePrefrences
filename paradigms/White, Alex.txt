  I did PFD in HS for 2 years, and I did IPDA and Parliamentary debate in college for 3 years.

I'm not familiar with all debate jargon and theory and I'm not too familiar with K's, but I do have a basic understanding.

I prefer if debaters didn't spread. I've told debaters this in the past, and some spread anyways. Many times when this happens I give the ballot to the team who is most clear. Debate is a communication event; if what you're saying isn't clear, you can't win. 

Debaters should have offense and defense. You shouldn't just use your own case to attack your opponent's case.

Analysis should be read with your cards, even if it's just a sentence or two.

At at the end of the round, I prefer voters (2-4 top reasons why you won and the opponent lost)

I'll usually flow new arguments, unless it's one of the last speeches. If an opponent is running new arguments against you then say so in your speech.

I value arguments that attack the opponent's logic more than just reading off multiple cards. In other words, quality over quantity.

LD:
Framework is important, but just because you win the framework doesn't mean you won the round. Show how your case wins with the weighing mechanism.

CX:
CX usually is in-depth debate on issues the general public isn't familiar with. Make sure you explain your argument and provide background info if needed. Don't assume I know every detail of the issue already.

Stock issues are important. But don't run unnecessary topicality arguments.
