  I try to use a tabula rosa judging philosophy, voting wherever you tell me
to. That said, this is policy debate and logical arguments with evidence
and analytics carry much more weight than performance or utopian claims.
I'm a big fan of topicality and kritiks only where it's appropriate and
well-argued, but generally don't like seeing kritiks at the novice level.
Speed is not a huge issue for me, but clarity is. If you hear me say
"clear" in the middle of your speech, slow down or enunciate better, it
means I'm not flowing. I will do very little work for you, and almost
never call for evidence after the round because you should have told me
exactly who to vote for and why. I do not flow cross-x but do listen, and
do not like excessive tag-teaming.
