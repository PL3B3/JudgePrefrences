  Currently a policy debater for Boston College.

Debated LD 3 years of high school both locally in Massachusetts and on the National Circuit. I have debated Policy at Boston College for three years.

Speaker Points: Debaters love to say that their args were dropped. If you say that they didn't respond to your argument and that's your only extension be ready to lose that flow unless it actually WAS dropped. Aka don't extend through ink.

For HS LD: Be Clear. I can probably flow your fastest if it's clear

I'm not too well read on PoMo philosophy. I like util debates but am not predisposed to prefer util frameworks. 

I don't really have much prejudice against any positions. Anything that is sexist, racist, or otherwise insensitive is not okay. your speaks will suffer and, depending on the severity of the offense, lose.

Things I like:

Things I don't like:

A 30 in front of me means a clear strategy throughout the round from the first CX to your last speech. When you can set your opponent up to lose and point out holes in their arguments you win my favor. Clear voters and extensions of why to vote for you makes my ballot so much easier to earn.
