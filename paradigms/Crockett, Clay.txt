I will attempt to keep this short, sweet, and simple. I like to see a good T debate. I think it is underutilized and underappreciated. Theory debates ought to be explained and impacted, but are otherwise encouraged. I will vote on the cheap shot. As long as it is an argument that is impacted I will vote on it. Absent another framework at the end of the debate I will default to the standard policy maker mindset. I will believe that I am making your plan happen at the end of the debate and all that jazz. That does not mean that I can’t be persuaded to change my framework. I view the world of the K just like any other argument. There is always a claim, warrant, and impact. If you do ride the K train, please have some discussion of what the world of the alternative looks like and what that means. I don’t care about the theoretical legitimacy of said alt. I only really have two rules. 1.) DEFEND WHAT YOU DO. 2.) HAVE FUN. What that means for you in the world of debate I can’t know but simply defend what you do and have fun. Any other questions please ask
