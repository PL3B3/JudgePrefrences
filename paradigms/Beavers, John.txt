LD Paradigm

I believe that debate is a communicative event, and should be focused on good public speaking and sound arguments.
The rate of delivery should be very slow.
I do not like debate jargon at all. All terms should be explained and the debate should stick to the topic (resolution). I do not like policy arguments unless the resolution clearly calls for it, and then only if policy jargon/terms are not used.
The quality of the evidence is more important than the quantity.
I canâ€™t express enough how important it is to speak slowly.
Big Picture Arguments are best.
