  I am an LD judge with a Congress background. I value slow speaking speeds because I value quality delivery. Respect for your opponent is paramount to avoid a LPW. While I tend to hold a utilitarian paradigm, I will vote based on which side offers the better links, evidence, logic, refutations, etc. I prefer to be provided with voting issues to help me focus my decision, and while I am becoming more acquainted with theory, I prefer the straightforward interpretation of a resolution in a round.
