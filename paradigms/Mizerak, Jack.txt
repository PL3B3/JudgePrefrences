  I debated policy for Lexington for 4 years, graduating in 07. Do not debate in college, though I have remained active by coaching for Lexington and by being involved in urban debate.
Generally I would say I'm fine with any argument, though I never considered myself particularly good with theory or the K, so run those at your own risk. For kritiks, I feel like my threshold of explanation is higher for the neg than the aff because I think most ks they way they are run are outlandish and don't have much of an impact. Don't get me wrong though, I will do my best to evaluate each argument evenly.
I have judged probably 15 rounds or so on the poverty topic, but they were all urban debate rounds. So while I know about the topic in general, I have little to no exposure of what it's like on the competitive circuit, ie, please say what your acronyms mean the first few times so I don't get lost.
