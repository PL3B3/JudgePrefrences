  I am an old school LD judge. I do not find it appealing when debaters "spread." Each competitior schould be able to articulate their points in a clear and concise manner in the time allotted and still be able to argue effectively. If a student does not address an opponents contention, I consider it a drop and it will result in a loss for the round. I feel like there should be a balance between defense and offense, and the competitors should be respectful and considerate within the spectrum of the debate.
