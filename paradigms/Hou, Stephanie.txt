  Debated for Des Moines Roosevelt (IA) on the national circuit with moderate success (two toc bid rounds).

In general, tech > truth. Arguments need a claim and a warrant. Run what you like. I will judge how I'm told to judge.

Speed
Speed is fine, clarity is better. I'm rusty so it may be in your interest to slow down.

Critiques/Performance/Project
I debated the K quite a bit my senior year and consider myself at least competently acquainted with most critique arguments, but explaining never hurts. If you're running a K aff, I think you should probably have a plan text. 

I don't have a lot of experience debating or judging performance and project. I have a hard time justifying an aff ballot if you don't defend the resolution, given the neg extends a compelling framework argument.

Counterplans
Counterplans should probably be textually and functionally competitive. I don't judge kick by default, so tell me if you want me to.

Theory
Theory debates usually end up being throw away arguments, but please try to keep it clean. Severence and intrinsicness are probably bad. Condo is debatable. I default to rejecting the argument.

Topicality
I don't have any familiarity with the economic engagement topic so I don't know what the norms for topicality are. I like aff-specific T arguments, and find generic t arguments are not compelling. I tend to default to competing interpretations but am sympathetic to reasonability.

Disads
These made up most of my 1NRs. The link probably controls the direction of uniqueness. I like disad overviews, and your disad should probably turn case at some point. There is such thing as absolute defense. Politics may or may not be intrinsic.

Feel free to ask any questions.
