  I competed in LD as a debater at Regis and have been judging for 9 years.

I view LD as a pedagogical exercise involving the civil exchange of arguments specifically related to a resolution, and I judge on that basis.

While I'm open to all manner of "alternative" arguments (eg, kritiks) and am comfortable spreading at speed, I evaluate debaters both on (1) the objective cogency of their arguments as well as (2) the coherence with which those arguments are articulated in the round.
