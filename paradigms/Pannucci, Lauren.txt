  This is my very first year as a coach and previous to that I have not had many experiences with LD debate.
I know how to judge, the format of a debate, as well as the structure of LD debate, but it would be best if you were to treat me like a lay judge since Princeton will be the first tournament where I will be officially judging.

No speed and be clear. If I can't understand you I will not flow it.

I don't care much for framework and pay more attention to arguments overall.

No debate jargon. If you are to use it, explain it.

Signpost and be sure to talk about voting issues. That being said, I will not drop you because you didn't talk about voting issues, but it would be much appreciated and make judging the round easier.

Overall, just be gentle. Don't run overly elaborate philosophy cases or theories. Stick to tradition.
