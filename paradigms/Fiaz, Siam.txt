  I have 4 years experience in Parliamentary debate, as well as some experience in debating and judging Lincoln Douglas. 

As for things I like, I don't have a personal preferance. Debate how you regularly debate. I'm open to anything as long as it makes sense and it persuades me that you're correct. This includes things like topicality and counterplan. However, if you are to employ different debate tactics but drop the original debate in any way I will dock you heavily.

Things to consider when being judged by me:-I am not a fan of spread. If you're speaking too quickly, I will say "clear" once. -there's a difference between confidence and being a strong speaker versus being rude. -I don't tolerate verbal abuse in any way. Debate, don't disrespect.
-I follow the flow carefully. If there's a point made, I expect the opposing team to answer it somehow.-I will be very well read on the rules of the round. If someone does something illegal, feel free to briefly mention it on your own time. Do not make a case out of it. 

Speaker Points: I will hand you low speaker points if you deserve them. This being speaking in a very monotone way, with no inflection in your voice or any passion in your argument. Debate is part style, so whether you believe in what you're debating or not, make me believe it. Speak well and you'll get high speaker points. I rarely award the maximum amount.

Good Luck
