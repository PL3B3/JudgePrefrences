  I like having a clean traditional debate. The only thing I want to hear you guys talk about is the resolution and whether that means you win or lose. Persuasion is important to me, so I really do not like when people do what is called "speed reading" or "spreading." Try and persuade me to vote for you. I will pay attention to what you say, but don't expect me to have write every word you say down.
