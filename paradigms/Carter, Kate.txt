  I am open to any style of debate - it's up to you! Debate to your strengths. That being said, debates that are centered around the question of should usually produce the most in-depth clash. Debates that stray too far from the resolution are usually vague and frustrating. These debates become difficult to decide since neither team truly engages the other.

I am not biased towards any specific theory arguments. If you can defend a strategy, read it, and make sure there is clash on the theory flow. Counterplan texts should be written in full before they are read. Affirmatives should write out the texts of permutations before they read them, not after the debate. Kritik link stories should be specific. Generic kritik debates are usually unpersuasive, so make sure to develop your link story. Productive framework debates need detailed impact analysis. 

The best speakers don't just extend arguments and author names in rebuttals, they compare the warrants in their arguments to those of their opponents. Compare your evidence quality, do some impact comparison, and frame the debate. Debate is about specificity, not empty buzzwords. Use your cross-x wisely, I am flowing it. Be honest about where you are winning and why it matters. The best debaters know that they need to win the most important arguments, not every argument. 

Be sure to have fun!
