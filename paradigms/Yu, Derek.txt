  I debated at woodlands (tx) for 3 years, qualifying for tfa state all 3 yrs and clearing at several bid tournaments my jr and sr year. Iâ€™m now a freshman at ut austin.


I try to be as tab as possible. as long has an argument as a claim and warrant, I'm open to voting on it.I don't have a whole lot of experience w/ dense philosophical frameworks aside from reading them occasionally at locals, so I'm prob not the best person to evaluate framework debate if that's your thing.slow down on tags, author names, interps and plan texts.I read mostly theory and larp-y positions my senior year, so that's what I'm most comfortable evaluating.plz add me to the email chain- derekyu9[at]gmail.comextra speaks if u bring me food

i'm not wholly familiar with some of the more obscure authors, but I think I have a solid grasp of the generics. this isn't to say that I won't vote off of these lesser-known authors, just plz make sure to explain the crux of the argument more than you might normally do.I don't really have a set expectation of what structure your argument has, just make sure that it has warrants and you're good to gocool w performance, rap, singing, etc, just make sure it's clearly explained
