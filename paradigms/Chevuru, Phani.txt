I was a LD debater on the local and national circuits for Valley High School in West Des Moines, IA from 2010 to 2013, and I am currently a freshman at Drake University. I did not debate my senior year of high school. This year, I will judge occasionally for Arbor View HS (NV). I am familiar with all common national circuit arguments, including tricks, theory, LARP, etc. However, as I did not run many Ks or theory-heavy strategies, I am less comfortable with them, and I would prefer debaters to not use them as their go-to strategies. Moderate speed is fine, but as I have been out of the activity for a year my flowing will be rusty. Make sure to weigh and properly extend arguments. I will attempt not to intervene in rounds.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
