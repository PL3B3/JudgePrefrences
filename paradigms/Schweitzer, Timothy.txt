As a debater, I competed for four years in high school at Galveston Ball. In college I competed at a few tournaments for the University of Texas at Dallas. I try my best not to bring in personal biases towards different arguments. I also try very hard to base my decision off of what the debaters said in the round versus reading stacks of cards at the end of the debate. I believe that topicality and theory debates are games of competing interpretations unless the debate determines another route for me. I love a good Counterplan / net benefit debate. I am not the most philosophical person in the debate community. If you decide to read a critique, it may take a little more work explaining it to me. I am a pretty open person and if you explain your argument well you should be fine.
