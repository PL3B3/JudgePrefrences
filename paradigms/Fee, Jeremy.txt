THE BIG THREE:
(1) Be polite.
(2) Signpost the parts of the cases, not just the evidence cards.
(3) Give me voters in your last speech so I can use them for my RFD.

HISTORY:
94-98: high school debater
98-03: college volunteer and paid judge
03-10: teacher/coach at Keller HS, Texas
10-12: teacher/coach at Flower Mound HS, Texas
12-present: teacher/coach at Lewisville HS, Texas

EXTRA:
I feel students should adapt to their judges.
I prefer students speak at a normal rate of speed.
I prefer traditional case structure.
