Judge Philosophy

 Traditional LD

 I don't mind policy type arguments in LD but please don't lose the
 value debate in the midst of policy type arguments.

I rely heavily on my flow - please give me voters - I don't like to
 intervene.

I am not a fan of theory unless there really is abuse in the round - I
 despise preemptive theory in the AC.

Moderate Speed

Clash - there must be clash in the round or I will default to the
 stronger position.
