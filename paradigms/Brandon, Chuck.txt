  Tabula rasa. Will default to a policy maker if not put in a specific paradigm. Counterplans are fine. K's are ok if the you can communicate it to me and demonstrate an understanding of its relationship to policy. Don't particulary like performance aff's but hey who knows, maybe you will be the one that changes my mind. Will listen to theory arguments as well. Before the round don't hesitate to ask me specific questions to gain a greater understanding of my philosophy. Speed is ok as long as it it clear. I like clear difference between tag lines and quotes. Also make it clear when going to the next argument. I believe civility in debate is important. This includes interactions with your partner, the opposing team and me. Have fun make sense and try to learn something. I promise I will try to do the same.
