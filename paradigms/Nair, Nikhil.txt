  things i like
- talking about the topic
- high quality evidence/evidence comparison
- impact calc and crystallization
-strong comparative analysis for your framework with your opponents


arguments i won't vote on:
- presumption triggers
- arguments that intentionally try to avoid the topic. on some level that's just lazy and can be used every round regardless of the topic. if you want to have a platform to talk about whatever important issue you want then go do that
- arguments that have racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory conclusions 
-arguments that are not warranted. if you just read and extend warrantless arguments i won't vote off them. its also your job to make the warrant clear to me

misc
- i'm probably tired when i'm judging you, so be interesting and emphasize the things you want me to pay attention to.
- if you're debating someone who is obviously less experienced than you are, please don't be mean. slow down and make the debate as fun and educational for them as possible. we've all been there before, and I'll raise your speaks for it.
- theory is ok but its all bullshit so try to sell it in a clever way or something
- i don't really get how "truth-testing" works
- sass is great and fun to watch, unnecessary rudeness is annoying 
-If you're planning to run a k, I want an explicit explanation on how it interacts with your opponents ethical assumptions. I want to know why these arguments matter in the round, so failing to have that comparative analysis means that I will have a much higher threshold for voting off your arguments.

-speed is ok i guess. if its clear. also when you're reading at a pace that would be ridiculous in the real world you need to either slow down at each new argument or number them. this does a lot for clarity
