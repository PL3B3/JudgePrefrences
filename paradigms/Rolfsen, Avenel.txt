  Hi everyone! My name is Avenel Rolfsen. I previously debated policy at Capital High School in Boise Idaho for 3 years. I’m currently a freshman at Westminster College in Salt Lake City. I’m pretty new to judging. I am a tabs judge. I’d like you to tell me what to vote for. I like impact calc and will vote on it a majority of the time. Usually the team with the most impacts wins in my book. I’m ok with T, theory and framework. I will vote on all three. These arguments need to have a good line by line however, and I need an impact to vote on it. I’m fine with K’s. However, if you can’t explain it well and I can’t understand it, I won’t vote on it. So make sure that with a K it’s clear how the Aff links, what the impacts are and what the alternative is. Time yourselves. Speed is fine. However make sure tags are slow. If I can’t understand I won’t flow it. And again if it’s something like a K, I’d like a clear explanation outside of just reading it to me. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
 Most Importantly, Have fun!
