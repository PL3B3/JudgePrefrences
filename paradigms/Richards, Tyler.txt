  If you're reading this you really only care about how to win my ballot, what you can and can't run in front of me, and how to get that 30. Let's get to it. If you want to know more about me, look here.
How to win my ballot-1. Weigh your arguments using the warranted framework in the round2. Tell me why that makes you win3. There is no step three... it's that easy
Arguments I can't hear enough of-
1. CPs (please make them unique to one side)
2. Functionality

Things that don't affect my decision-1. Speed (I can handle nearly anything as long as it's clear)2. Style/format of arguments
How to win my heart (get good speaker points)-
1. Good rhetoric
2. Cross examination dominance
3. Analysis rather than regurgitation of literature


About me-I debated LD for 3 years at Timber Creek and have judged around 50 LD and PF rounds over the past three years. I am a flow heavy judge, I have never made a decision that was not based on my flow. If you ever have a problem with my decision, I will never change it post round but will be willing to discuss critiques if you so desire. My email is tylerjrichards@gmail.com
