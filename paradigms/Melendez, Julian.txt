I am currently an assistant debate coach at Grapevine High School coaching LD. I debated in policy debate for the past five years and I have judged both CX and LD for the past year or so. I am fine with any argument so run whatever you want.

Policy philosophy

Like I said I'm fine with all arguments just be able to explain them. Make sure to slow down a bit when you are on T or theory and speak clearly. Besides that it's up to you run a k, da, T, cp. All at the same time???? i dont care just be able to debate it out and defend it theoretically.

LD philosophy

I'm fine with speed but speak clearly. I want arguments to be impacted and compared. I like clash in debate rounds so don't ignore eachothers arguments and hope that I am going to piece things together after round. LD is separate from policy debate and many cx arguments do not apply outside a policy framework. In general say whatever you want just be able to debate it and defend it.
