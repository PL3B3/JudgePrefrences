  Hi!
 I am a judge for Harrison High School in New York and a grad school student.
  
 I am new to the game of debate. Please treat me like a LAY JUDGE and minimize the use of jargon!
  
  
 I will flow what I can, but you will need to speak SLOWLY! To quote from a fellow judge: 
 
Please signpost.
 Please speak slowly and clearly.
 The better the speaker, the better I understand.
 Please time yourselves.
  
 I will vote for the debater who persuades me more. You should not pref me unless you are highly persuasive.
  
Have fun in the round!
