What paradigm best describes your approach to debate?_xPolicy Maker _Stock Issues _Tabula Rasa_Games Player _Hypothesis Tester _Other (Explain)

What do you think the Aff burdens should be?
The affirmative needs to prove that they have a good solid workable case that is supportive by a preponderance of the evidence. They need to present a workable plan that is cohesive with the case that they are promulgating. However, if you put me in a different paradigm…I’ll certainly listen and evaluate it.

What do you think the Neg burdens should be? The negative has the burden of refutation. At some point they need directly to clash with some of points made by the affirmative. They should not try to warp the round until the negative sets the grounds and topic for the debate. There should be some semblance of the initial topic choice of the affirmative. However, if all you have are generic positions that you love to run every round...go ahead and I’ll be glad to listen to it.


How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)?
I’m cool with whatever you want to do.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks?
I’m fine with whatever.

How I feel about case debates?
Ok.

Other Comments/Suggestions: 
I would love to see well warranted debates. I’m fine with whatever argumentation you want to run. However, unless you establish otherwise, I’ll default policymaker.
