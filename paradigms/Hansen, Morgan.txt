  I'm more of a traditional judge. I did debate in highschool but mostly on the local circuit. I’ll do my best to vote on the flow, but just because the Aff dropped the #2 on the standard doesn't mean I give it any more credence than a better explained and more persuasive argument. 


A small amount of speed is okay, but if you don’t see me flowing I am probably not getting it down. 
I’m not incredibly familiar with tricks, or lots of jargon (I'm still getting used to terms like "PIC" or "kritik"). You can run whatever you want in front of me, but the more complex the position the more nuanced your explanation needs to be. As long as you explain the function of the arguments in round, I should be fine.
I’m probably most comfortable with big impact/util debates.
