2  -- 4 -- 6 -- 8, why do we love debate?

3 -- 5 -- 7 -- 9, it's because we're so fine.
As you can tell, I not only have I debated LD for the Bronx High School of Science (and no I have never gotten shot at as many of you might think...), I was the one and only debate cheerleader for the team. My paradigm is very similar to my personality. The best way to find out and understand my paradigm is to just talk to me -- I don't bite... so that makes me somewhat approachable.
But if you don't... this is what I'm looking for:
As far as positions and jargon goes, I've been debating for too long, so I know the ropes and jargon. I've always been somewhat of a traditionalist, but I'm open to pretty much everything and anything (theory, kritiks, etc). I'm fine with whatever you send my way, but just keep in mind the more entertaining the better.
I can handle speed but not at the sake of clarity and a major headache. If you are going to spread out your opponent, make sure that 1. you don't spit all over me, that's just gross, 2. you are clear, 3. you're giving your opponent a chance (i.e. varsity debaters please don't spread out the novices).
"This is LD not policy" clich√© yes I know, but keep that in mind when you give a speech. Values are important, be sure to explain how your value premise and value criterion link to one another and definitely link back to them throughout the round.
Organization is always a good thing. Each argument should have a claim, warrant, and impact. Please weigh.
Tell me why you win the round, what arguments did you extend, turn, etc.
I'm a happy go lucky kind of girl, so I don't want to see any thing dirty going on - no lying, backstabbing, violence, sliming, or anything of that nature.
Most importantly show me that you're having fun! That's what debate should be about, not just winning, but having a great time!
Smile, relax and most importantly HAVE FUN!!! :-)
I will do my best to answer any further questions.
