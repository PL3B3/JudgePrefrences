  Debate background: I was an LDer for the Hockaday school for four years. I competed both on the local and national circuit during that time. My style changed a lot, but towards the end of my career, I found myself running more critical-esque arguments.

Theory: I'm fine with it. I understand it.

Kritiks: If I understand it, and you're winning on the flow, I'll vote you up.

Plans/Counterplans: As long as you have all the right parts, we are good to go.

DAs: Okay.

Speed: If you're clear, then you're Gucci.

Clearly offensive arguments (i.e. rape good) are automatic drops.

I will shamelessly inflate speaks if you bring me snacks (but they have to be good snacks).
