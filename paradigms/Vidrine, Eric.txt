  I am a strict LD constructionist.
The purpose of spending time together is education. Education is illuminated by clash. Pointing out stark contrasts between positions is a hallmark of excellent debate. Note: Clash does not infer disrespect. I am more inclined to align with a respectful style given equal positions.
Speed
Do not spread or your speaks will suffer, I am a traditional LD judge and am not very fond of 
Points
Generally range 26-30 and take into account demonstration of respect for opponent and process. Don't be a pushover or overly nice to the point of condescending them though. 
Theory and Kritik
My default position is that the framers of the resolution knew what they were doing and that the subject, as stated, is appropriate for LD. I am open to any argumentation, but I am not very inclined to vote up K’s unless you explain them well, and don’t make me debate the round for you, explain your K, I don’t want to have to think and make up arguments for you. I don’t like non-topical stuff but don’t take that as a warrant to run topicality against your opponent, thats equal to non-topicality.
You can run Theory but if its stupid it will be easy to weigh against. Ex: “You have to do the 1NR while doing jumping jacks.”if your opponent says “thats dumb”I’ll say “you’re right”and your T won’t hold any ground. If you’re going to run T, run T right. 
I don’t care if you sit or stand, I'm not very strict on anything, if there are evidence disputes I will ask to see evidence after round. 
Abuse:
Don’t do it. At the very least your speaks will suffer, at the worst you’ll drop the ballot. 
Other than that I’m pretty laid back and am open to hearing good arguments, good luck. 
Remember kids: Spreading is a tool not a tactic.
