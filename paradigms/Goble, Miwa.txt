  I am VERY new to LD, so speed really isn’t a great idea. There are no circumstances under which I will vote for a debater who runs any “oppression good” argument, theory, disclosure, or policy arguments. PLEASE don’t be offensive in round, and try to keep it nice in CX (I will dock speaks if you’re unnecessarily rude to your opponent in round).

I should be judging in the NOVICE division.
