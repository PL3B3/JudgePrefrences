   I am a parent judge,yet have a lot of experience. I have judged at the district,state, and national level(Yale,Harvard, and Blue Key prelims and out rounds). I obtained my bachelors degree in Marketing and Management from Florida International University. I have a masters degree in business also from Florida International University and I am currently a big business manager for AT&T.
 When judging I value strong and clear arguments. Please do not spread or make arguments based on theory alone. Be persuasive and convincing with facts, do not use jargon or terminology that no one knows. I like very well organized and structured speeches, I should be able to flow you at all times. Simply pretend I am a judge in a courtroom and you are the attorney trying to persuade me either way. Your voice inflection,tone,pace and expression play a critical role as well. I will also be looking at the professionalism and courtesy that you display towards your opponent. I consider myself to be a very fair judge that doesn't take into account any bias or personal opinion.
