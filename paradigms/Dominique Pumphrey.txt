Background:



*I debated in high school for 3 years at Paul L. Dunbar High School

*Current Competitive Debate Program Manager for the Baltimore Urban Debate League



My Thoughts on Debate:



I think debate should be fun and educational.



Type of debates that I like:



I like good debates. I appreciate when impacts are weighed early in the round. 




Specifics:



Flashing-I don’t take prep for flashing.

Theory- Theory is ok if well explained.




K Debate- If you don’t understand it, don’t run it. I am not a big fan of K’s. Also don’t be discouraged to run K’s in front of me if you are good at it because those debates tend to really make me think, and rethink things. Education is huge to me in rounds, thus K’s must have a clear alternative.



DA, CP, Case- I tend to vote on clash. I need to know why your impacts are more significant than your opponents. Weight your impacts early!

Alternative/Performance- No matter how good you music, song, poem, dance or what ever it you must keep in mind that this is debate and you have to actually answer arguments and defend the things you do in debate.
