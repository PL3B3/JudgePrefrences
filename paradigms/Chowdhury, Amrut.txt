  I debated 4 years at Desert Vista High School (fall 2007- spring 2011), 2 of those in CX
I currently debate for the University of Texas at Austin (fall 2011 - ongoing)

Major bullet points
Don’t tool your partner, It will be reflected in your speaksCross Ex is important, I don’t flow it but I pay attention.I only look at evidence if it is contested or explained well in the final rebuttals.I flow on paper, go a little bit slower on theory if you actually want me to judge it accurately (or care about it).I don’t take prep for flashing unless you take an egregious amount of time
Specifics

T
I like T debates but don't assume I'm knowledgeable about the popular interps on the topic. . Try and avoid a 2nc having a wall of arguments without referencing the 2AC.

DA/Case/CP strategies
Impact Calc is key. If you don't do it I'll fill in whatever I think is likely or I'll let my mind wander before consulting evidence that was only extended in name.
- I default to offense defense, but can be convinced to vote on zero risk of a DA (assuming the necessary work is invested).
- I don’t have any strong views on CP theory, but if your only offense against a CP is theory, I would highly suggest you pay attention to the relevant bullet point above.
- I won’t vote on a double turn unless it is pointed out.
- I won't kick a counterplan for you unless you tell me.

Ks (aff/neg)
Don't assume I know your lit base. Impact out roles of the ballot (explain what arguments they affect). Remember that I flow on paper when planning your overview.

Clash of Civs
I am open to not having a plan, or advocacy statement. I prefer teams engage the direction of the topic, but that isn’t necessary. If you're going for framework or answering it make sure to specify what type of education is important.
