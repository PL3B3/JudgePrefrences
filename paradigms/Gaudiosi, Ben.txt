  Graduated from Montville Township High School in 2014. Currently attending Boston University, where I do Parli debate.

I did LD all 4 years of high school, so I'm very familiar with all the the arguments and jargon. I'll let you know if I can't understand you in terms of speed by saying clear.

In terms of argument types, the only limits I really have are that:
1) your arguments not be offensive
2) you actually explain them.
If you're going to use block file with 14 one sentence arguments, I'll flow them, but they won't carry very much weight for you even if your opponent misses a few.

I'm okay with theory arguments, but only when the abuse is legitimate - I really don't agree with theory being used as strategy. I'll default to reasonability, although I'll listen to arguments for both.

I enjoy critical arguments, assuming you have a good link and you actually know what you're talking about. Generic Ks are really boring though - try to stay away from Cap, Anthro, etc. unless the topic or AC clearly lends itself to that.

No matter what type of argument you're running, don't forget this is still LD and you need to give me a framework or some kind of mechanism for evaluating the round, otherwise there's really no way I can vote for you.

In terms of speaks:
30 - You really wow'd me. Probably the best speech/round of the tournament.
29 - Very good round, you're probably going to break.
28 - Good.
27 - Completely average.
26 - Bad
25 - Really Bad
24 and lower - Offensive arguments
