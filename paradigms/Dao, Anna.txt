  I am a parent judge. I mostly judge LD local tournaments in the Dallas area.

While I can flow, it is pretty much impossible for me to understand your arguments if you’re spreading so go slow. I cannot emphasize this enough. If I do not understand you, I will put my pen down and stop flowing.

Don’t run theory or Ks as I won’t be able to understand the nuances, stick to giving me a clear and simple ballot story. If your opponent is being very flagrantly abusive, i.e. they claim that you must win 40 separate arguments and your own case in order to win, point that out and I’ll evaluate. 

In terms of speaks, clarity, fluidity, quality of argumentation, and courtesy are most important. My median is 28, you’ll get a 30 if you’re exceptionally good and a 25-26 if you’re exceptionally bad or if you run theory or a K in front of me. 

I prefer value criterion debate.

I am fairly new to this, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun!

For bid tournaments, feel free to strike me.
