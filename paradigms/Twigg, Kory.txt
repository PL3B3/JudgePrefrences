  Speed:
- Debate is about persuasion and communication.
- I suggest you speak at a rate where you can do both.

Ways to gain speaker points:
- Crystallize
- Speak Clearly
- Have Stage Presence
- Use CX time to set up future speeches

Ways to loose speaker points:
- Laughing/Heckling during opponent’s speech.
- Speaking incomprehensibly


Don’t Bother Arguing:
- New in the Two Bad (Policy)
The 2NC is a constructive and will be treated as such.
- Topical Counter Plans (Policy)
I cannot justify affirming the resolution with a Negative ballot. It is an inherently contradictory argument.
- Any argument that you don’t understand.
If it is clear that you don’t understand the position, then I will not vote on it.

Things I like:
- Find and point out contradictions (C/D)
When debaters correctly point out contradictions, I will throw out both arguments that contradict.
- PMAs
Tell me why the Plan cannot meet the advantage.
- Case Debate
I learned debate from a legendary dinosaur, as such, I am prone to voting here.
- Time Frame Arguments
Both AFF & NEG are guilty of claiming outrageous benefits/disadvantages. If a nuke war occurred even 0.000001% of the time it was evoked in the debate round, we’d have died out long ago. These arguments are fine to run, but you better have a time frame.
- Clash
Don’t just extend the 1AC #2 if it has five responses. Answer the responses and then tell me why the 1AC #2 still applies, better yet, answer the responses and tell me why I should vote. Same goes for the NEG.
- Maintaining Advocacy
If you punt an advantage early, don't expect me to find it for you later to vote on it. If you want me to weight the issue, you need to tell me to vote on it early and often. Pull the position and give me clear voters to weight.
