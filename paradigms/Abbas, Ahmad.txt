In a nutshell, I am less concerned with what you choose to go for and more concerned with how well you go for it. Strategy formulation and execution make more of a difference for me than the types of arguments.

That said I do have some tendencies that are important to keep in mind:

Topicality/Theory – I have not judged any debates on this topic. If your strategy is to go for T, please keep in mind that I may not automatically know all topic specific jargon. A strong evidentiary basis for your T argument can be more convincing than simple dictionary definitions. Other theory arguments are fine. Please be sure to differentiate why theory is a reason to vote in a particular direction as opposed to simply rejecting the theoretically objectionable acts/arguments of your opponent.

Ks – Please be sure to contextualize the link, impact and alternative in terms of the argument(s) being critiqued. This is true for the aff and the neg. I’m not an expert on every vein of philosophy, so contextualization is important. I have a very limited experience with performance based debate. A thorough explanation for why I should vote in a particular direction will be needed.

CP’s – If your CP is based on a very technical aspect of the aff or the topic, please do a thorough job of explaining the mechanism of the CP. Generic CP’s are fine as long as they compete.

Disads and Case – Similar to CP’s. If your arguments rely on a higher degree of topic/aff understanding, then better explanation or evidence will help in selling your argument.

Other important comments – Argument comparisons are critical. These should be used heavily in rebuttals to differentiate why you are winning the debate. Please maintain a level of civility and respect for all participants in the round. I know this set of thoughts is not exhaustive. Feel free to ask any questions you might have before the round.
