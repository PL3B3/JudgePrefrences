  1) Having some policy background, I am fine with speed but if you aren't understandable or the speed hinders your ability to be articulate don't do it.
2) I must see clash, and I will be flowing.
3) I'm an impact judge (whether LD, PF, or Policy) I will weigh societal impacts in your favor every time, specifically if you pull them out in your voters.
4) I like to see original cases but if you are an effective debater with unoriginal points I won't hold it against you.

Other than these it is free game. 
Background: In high school I tried out Policy, PF, LD (briefly), and Congress but I did PF for three years relatively consistently, I went to nationals my senior year.
I currently debate for Gonzaga University on the British Parliamentary team, I've done so for two years.
