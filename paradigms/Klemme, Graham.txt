  Competitive Policy Debate Experience

2008-2010 Iowa City High School (IA)
2011-2012 The University of Iowa

While I have several years of policy debate experience in national circuit high school and college programs, nothing has shaped the way I view debate more than my professional experience. For that reason, I've included a link to my LinkedIn profile. Take into account my political and communications experience as well as my degree in economics when considering your approach to a round in front of me. My threshold for critical debate has inched higher over the years, but I do believe it's my responsibility as a judge to reciprocate the time and energy that students have put into their arguments into making my decision. 

Please, be friendly!
