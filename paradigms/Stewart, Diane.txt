General:
--LD--
I generally only look to arguments that Impact to the winning standard - ex. If your contentions all rely on util but util is thoroughly discredited in the round I won't use them to decide. PLEASE impact to standards. I hate making these links on your behalf, and I'll only do it if your opponent didn't have any links either.

Pet Peeve: I hate it when people say "our advocacy" or "we propose" . You aren't multiple people, and I like to keep the illusion that your coach didn't write your entire case for you alive.

--PF--
Don't feel like you have to fit your style to an LD paradigm, I won't expect it and I won't be confused if you do what you are used to. Have good analytics, instead of just throwing a ton of cards on the flow.

--Both--
I will not vote on something that doesn't engage with the resolution(meta-debate, theory in the constructive as opposed to against actual abuse). Unique arguments that are still resolutional are welcome(and encouraged!), though.

I have no problem with speed, but I would prefer not to hear you breathing.
