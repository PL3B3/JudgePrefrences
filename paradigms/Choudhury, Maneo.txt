  I currently coach for Edgemont High School and debate for Binghamton University.

I prefer real world impacts. That being said, I'm pretty open minded about what would qualify as an real world impact. But just be realistic about it. You're not gonna win that its better for us to go extinct than to live a life without value... but maybe you could win that solving for value to life is more important than solving for a 5% risk of extinction. 

I'll be writing more here later about my feelings about various arguments, but for now all you need to know is that you shouldn't radically change your strategy just cause you're in front of me. I'm more likely to vote for an argument I disagree with if you show expertise and mastery than I am to vote for an argument I agree with if you don't seem to know what you're talking about.
