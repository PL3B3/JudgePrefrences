Lincoln Douglas and Policy Coach/Judge

Framework is important. Period. It tells me my role in the debate. I usually default to being a policy maker trying to do what is best for everyone. If you have reasons for me judging the round from a deontological view point then make your case- I’m likely to believe it.

Topicality is not meant to be used as time skew- so don't. That is not educational. Abusive team will lose points. I am not one of those judges that say that if you’re going for T it must be the only thing in the 2NR.

That being said- Theory is a favorite of mine- I'm not a hack but I really enjoy theory debates.
I like to hear case args more than anything. Especially solvency turns. I was taught that debate is all about “Whether or not the plan is a good idea.” Optimally, the 1NC should turn every single aspect of the 1AC. Impact analysis should consume the last two speeches.

On the more “you as a debater level,” If you are catty or jerks in round I will hate it and hate you. Be funny, call out the other teams dumb arguments, but keep it under control.

I really love Debate and believe that the activity is often disrespected by its participants. Decorum is important. This is where you'll extra speaks from me. Or lose them for that matter.
