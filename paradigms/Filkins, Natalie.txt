  I am a parent and this is my second year judging Lincoln Douglas debate. I understand LD case structure (ie value, value criterion, contentions, ect.) I am familiar with a good deal of philosophy, and I don't mind more complicated cases, so long as they are well supported. Be sure to make framework arguments very clear and extend your arguments. When extending, don't just give me an author name, but briefly reiterate the argument. It is very important you impact and give voters to make my life easier. If you want some brownie points, I think CX is the time to be clear about your arguments and answer your opponents questions directly, not the time to be shady and deceiving.
I am beginning to understand theory, but I would not run it unlessYour opponents abuse is incredibly clearYou have no other strat to get around the abuseBut again, I am not incredibly versed on theory, so I would water down your theory shellI will always vote on arguments, however speaking style is appreciated.I am fine with flex prepI can neither flow nor understand speed, however you may speak at a quicker than conversation pace.I don't mind if you are aggressive but I will nuke your speaker points if you resort to Ad hominem attacks.I will usually disclose, if both debaters agree to itI look forward to judging you, remember to have fun! :)
