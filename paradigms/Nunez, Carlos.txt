Debated for Bergenfield High School (NJ) for 4 years – 2001-2004
I have judged many times on the High School policy circuit, but I am new to this topic.
 
I like arguments to make sense, first and foremost. I like clear explanation of arguments and how they interact with the debate.
I am fine with speed as long as it does not interfere with clarity.
I am also fine with open cross-ex.
 
I love critical arguments – I used to go for them a lot as a debater. I think I have a bit of a high standard for K debate though – I think a lot of times framework arguments are made incorrectly or incoherently, and I often find myself being very critical of K debates, especially when they interact with Topicality in some way (when there is a critical aff run, for example). I think they can be a powerful argument though and I am generally fascinated by the critical positions.
 
I am fine with any other argument. Just ask any specific questions you may have.
