  Open to pretty much listening to any argument/case in all debate events.
If you speak too fast, I will tell you to slow down. 
I flow on paper.
Keep your own time; check your opponents time; do not steal prep time.

PF: I do not flow cross fire. I do not flow new arguments in the final focus. Check evidence during crossfire or prep time (do not create random time for evidence check). How to get high speaks: strategic questions asked during crossfires, do not be rude/do not create a screaming match, do not steal prep time, do not misinterpret your evidence, create clash, do not be sexist, be efficient with your time/be organized, make it easy for me to flow your speech, and make logical arguments.
CX/LD: probably best to treat me like a lay judge who knows some debate jargon. I am not well read in theory/critiques, so it might take some more explanation/work on your part for me to understand.



If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask before or after round
