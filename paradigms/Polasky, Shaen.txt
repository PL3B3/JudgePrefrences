  Lincoln-Douglas Debate Paradigm 

1. Experience - I debated for 4 years in High School. I have bachelor’s degrees in philosophy and psychology and master’s degree in teaching. I am currently the head debate coach at Indianola High School in Iowa. 

2. General Outlook - I fully expect debaters to be critical thinkers and not parrots. I prefer that debaters clearly articulate the clash in the round and I am open to nearly all forms of argumentation. However, debaters should understand, analyze and evaluate the arguments presented in the round. Debaters who simply get up and read or extend a “coach prepared speech” or a “speech bought online”, without a significant understanding of what they are saying, will be judged critically. 

3. Standards/Framework - I prefer the debate to include the traditional value/criterion structure. I consider this to be an important part of the debate. As a judge, I want the debaters to present a clear standard with which to evaluate the round. Make sure you tell me which arguments matter the most and why I should vote on them. 

4. Argumentation – I expect there to be clash and for opponents to give significant analysis of this clash. 

5. Speed - I flow decently. With that said, I strongly prefer quality over quantity in LD. A smaller number of highly relevant and clearly articulated arguments will carry much more weight than a multitude of poorly articulated and questionably relevant arguments on my flow sheet.

6. Speaker Points - I use speaker points to rate the overall persuasiveness of a debater's rhetoric, to include their use of body language and eye contact. I also believe debate should be competitive yet civil. Debaters who stoop to slandering other debaters or use inappropriate language will be docked points. 

7. Post Round - I like to review the round closely before I make my decision, however, if time permits, I am willing to thoroughly discuss by decision if requested.
