  I consider myself a policy maker by default, although the framework is up for debate in the round. All arguments are good to run, however you should know that I prefer policy impacts.I don't mind kritiks, IF the impacts take place in the hypothetical post-plan world, NOT outside the fourth wall of the round. I do abide by the rules of the game, so if your opponents utterly mishandle it, I won't intervene to strike down arguments, even if I do not like them.

Speed is good, but it has been a while since I have been in a debate round, so please be clear and please slow down on tags and analyticals. If I call "clear" twice in one speech and you fail to clear it up, I will stop flowing. Please try not to extend or refer to cards solely by cite, it makes it really difficult to flow and if I do not understand what card you are referring to, I am not going to make assumptions on your behalf, such as "It would make sense if he is talking about this card." I just won't write the argument. Instead of "Please extend the McGruber '97 card" say "extend the fourth card from the 1NC shell" or even "extend our card that says yada yada yada".

Do not be a prep-time thief. I do enjoy SHORT pre-speech roadmaps, but BEWARE. If you sayl "stop prep time" and then stands there for a bunch of time talking to your partner, passing flash drives, etc., I WILL just go ahead and start your speech time. Don't waste my time.
