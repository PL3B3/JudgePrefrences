Crystal Springs Uplands School ‘17
Harvard ‘21

I debated LD for 4 years in high school. I have some experience on the national circuit.

-I don’t want to intervene. Please weigh the different arguments clearly and tell me how they interact. Great arguments only work if you can compare and weigh them within the round.
-I’m familiar with technical debate, but I haven’t kept up with the LD world since I graduated. I’ll listen to just about anything as long as it’s not exclusionary.
-Speed if fine. I’ll say clear if needed. Consider repeating what you last said if I say clear.
-I love framework debate. No pressure to have a framework debate, but I feel like comparing moral frameworks is one of the major skills that LD teaches you.
