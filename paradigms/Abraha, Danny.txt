  I debated in high school and now debate at North Texas.

I'm a tab judge that can be persuaded to vote on most anything, but for some general guidelines -

T - reasonability can be persuasive, i default to competing interpretations, impact your standards, tell me why they matter.

Kritiks - i enjoy many and am familiar with a lot of them and ran them often in debate, please stay away from k jargon, have a clear impact, and alt. framing the debate is important, why should 'x' come first

CP/disads - I enjoy them, have a clear net benefit, they should be competitive with the aff, i tend to default neg on the condo debate

case - i like case? Impact/case turns are great

clarity is very important, go as fast as you want as long as it's coherent
