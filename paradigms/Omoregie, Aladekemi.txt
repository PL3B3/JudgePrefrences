  I debated policy and public forum for Newark Science, I usually judge LD rounds.

As far as the round goes:

Presumption: No presumption, I listen to both sides

K's: I love them; however, the only Ks I don't like are anthro Ks, I think they're dumb.

Speed: I'm fine with speed as long as your tags are clearly enunciated. Please slow down for analytics. If I can't understand you, I will say "clear" twice. If I can't understand you after that, I will stop flowing. I don't call for cards because I couldn't understand them, so please make sure you are clear.

Theory: DO NOT RUN THEORY. You don't get it, I don't get it, I won't vote on it.

Cross Examination: Can't believe I have to say this, but CX is binding; however, I don't flow CX

Miscellaneous: I prefer not to hear any deontology arguments, but if you must, I will evaluate them fairly. If you're racist, homophobic, ableist, or display any other kind of bigotry during the round, I don't have to vote for you.
