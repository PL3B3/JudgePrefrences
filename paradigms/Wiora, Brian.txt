  Hello. My name is Brian Wiora, I am a senior at Greenhill School where I have debated 4 years in LD. 

WOODWARD PARADIGM: 
I am good with most things but here are a couple of things you should note about me:

I will not vote on presumption. 

I am more likely to drop a claim than add a warrant. This means spikes extended out of the AC with one sentence, or fragment, are more likely to be dropped than evaluated. 

Theory- 
I am not the best theory judge but understand its necessity. But I think of theory differently than most judges do. For me it is a call for intervention so if I don't like certain interps, or counter interps, I will make it obvious. If you choose to ignore me, expect me to reciprocate and ignore the shell. So, if you dislike intervention then don't run theory in front of me. Also, I will not evaluate theory spikes in the AC because they are entirely unwarranted and make the abuse story that much more obvious. 

Speaks- 
I will try to average a 28. A 30 is rare. CX heavily influences speaks

Speed-
I am about an 8.5. Don't go your top speed but feel free to speak quickly. 

What do I want to see?
A debate with a lot of clash. I hate the strategy where negs try to avoid the aff or where affs are full of spikes to avoid debating the neg. Debates that are focused on one issue, whether that is framework, topicality, or offense, will help both your opponent and you in terms of speaks and a better RFD.
