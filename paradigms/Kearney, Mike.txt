Debated at Missouri State

Topicality: 
voter > no voter
limits > abstract education arguments. 
topic literature > limits for the sake of limits.

Critiques: 
even the most wretched fear to die > value to life
links to the plan > links to reps
topical affs > random topics

Counterplans: 
-i don't 'revert to the status quo' unless the NEG makes the argument explicitly
-conditionality seems reasonable
-"doing the AFF" doesnt seem competitive

Cheap shots:
warrantless voting issue = not an argument

Evidence:
plz talk about it

Risk assessment:
"zero risk" exists
presumption arguments should be made more often
"link first" makes a lot of sense to me
