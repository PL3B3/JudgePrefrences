I debated locally for about three years and then switched over to extemp.

Feel free to ask me questions before and after the round.

I will try to flow everything to assess the round fairly; however, I would appreciate it if you speak clearly and give me a decisive roadmap as to which arguments come first and how to weigh. Compare the arguments! 

If you are going to fast, I'll call it out at most three times. Also, be nice to your opponents or your speaking points will drop. 

I am not familiar with the topic literature. I am not experienced in judging theory, kritiks, and the like; however, if you do run such arguments, I will add more importance to CX.
