  I am a lay/parent judge from Coral Springs High School. I have judged approximately 30 rounds on the local South Florida circuit over the last year and a half. Please make all arguments and rebuttals abundantly clear and well supported. Be very explicit in how your support proves your points true. If you choose to use creative arguments, be sure to explain it very well and be very clear on how they support your value and criterion. I will not consider any theory arguments, so running them will only eat up your time. I will be unlikely to understand any speed above conversational. Rudeness will negatively impact your speaker points.
