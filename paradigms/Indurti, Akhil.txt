Substance over procedurals.Logic over evidence.Quality over quantity.
DETAIL

I occasionally judge for: VHSL
Topic Familiarity: Lots. I’ve studied, argued, and participated in a large number of surveillance-related discussions.
ROL: I can handle speed. Just don’t spew. Be clear on tags.

Ideal 2NR strategies ranked
Case + DADA + CP (net benefits)Impact Turning all advantages (good impact debates are awesome)Topic K generic
Non-voters
K FW that change the decision from yes/no policy - no chanceTheory — I think theory blocks ruin debate. If you can prove in-round abuse, I might think about it.FW - They reduce the clash on the topic, and make the debate dictatorial. Neg FW makes sense if the AFF’s abusive, in which case you probably don’t need to run it.
Views about Topicality on this topic: Let’s just say I’m not going to vote on possessives, adjectives, or descriptors. Besides proven abuse, I’ll most likely vote on T if it’s on “domestic” or “surveillance”.

Counterplans: The more strategic the better. It’s disappointing to see a PIC get dropped, but I generally like CP’s.

Kritiks: I used to love running outlandish K’s, but I’d rather see you debate Security well than Heidegger poorly. 
Authors & Lit I think are relevant this year:
FoucaultReductionism vs. CoherentismHuman Dignity/Technology (Warren & Brandeis)CapitalismData (Caulfield & Brownsword)Desensitization
View on evidence vs. logic scale: I err slightly more on logic, but empirical evidence is very important for this topic, e.g: # number of collections by PRISM, extent of Tempora, etc.

Resolving things: 
If there’s a K AFF against a procedural, I’m more likely to vote for the K AFF if the procedural doesn’t prove enough abuse.If it’s Varsity/Open, I’m not going to spend extra work unwinding contradictions. If you don’t point out a dropped arg, don’t do analysis on the voting issue (impacts), or don’t mention a turn, I won’t count them.
Speaker points: Unless you blow me away like Jon Stewart or the POTUS, you can expect 29 as a max, and every awkward pause, unexplained voter, or unclear spew is -1. I don’t generally go below 20, so you essentially have 9 chances to not mess up.
