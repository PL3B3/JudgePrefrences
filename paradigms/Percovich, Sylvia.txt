  Hello I'm a student at Harvard and though I did do debate for 4 years I mostly have experience in public forum debate and I am not familiar with all of these complicated meta-ethical arguments you maybe tempted to run in front of me and I am not good at following speed however I do understand theory and kritikal arguments so long as it is articulate well if you have any specific questions I would suggest you just ask me so that there is no confusion.
