  Hello! I debated for 4 years at Interlake High School and am now at Carnegie Mellon University.

In General
I read a fairly wide variety of arguments in high school and liked my fair share of both sides of the spectrum.Don’t be an asshole. Please.Debate is first and foremost an educational activity. If you win the flow but are a jerk about it and aren’t helping anyone in the room learn, I will be very unhappy. >:(Run whatever you feel comfortable with and I’ll listen.Buzz words are my nemesis. Grr.It’s been a while since I debated and I’ve never seen any debates on this topic so chances are if you drop acronyms and references to specific cases I might not get it.
More Specifically
re: planless affs/kritikal affs, go for it. I read affs with plans and without plans in high school and enjoyed both. But, aff conditionality is probably not a thing so don’t be super shifty and do provide stable ground and room for clash.re: kritiks, spewing jargon at light speed is a sure fire way to make me upset. I probably haven’t read and don’t understand the literature you’re working with in depth so explanations are so very important.re: theory, I default to reject the argument, not the team and think conditionality is good and internal contradictions are bad. I can be convinced otherwise but be prepared to spend a lot of time doing so.Having quality evidence and doing meaningful evidence comparison is an excellent way to get more speaker points!
