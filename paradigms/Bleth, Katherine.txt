  I debated policy in high school for three years, and I have been coaching policy for five years at Rosemount High School. I will vote on and have voted on literally everything. Yes, I will vote on theory - but you better go all out, I'm not going to take 30 second extensions. I am totally comfortable with K literature. I do require that you do not assume I know your K inside out. I expect you to defend the K by explaining it clearly with your words. If you depend upon pure jargon, I will assume you actually don't know your K, and therefore I will not want to vote for you (and if I am forced to vote for you, I will not be happy to do so). 
I love Topicality, and I think it is currently one of the more underutilized arguments in policy right now. Run Topicality in front of me, and do it well throughout the entire debate, and I will forever love you even if I don't give you the ballot. 
I will tell you if you're being unclear during your speeches. I expect you to do that yourself. If I do not flow your argument because you were being unclear, then I will not vote on it. Slooooooooooow down on tags, ESPECIALLY in K literature. Do not read everything at the exact same speed. 
 Otherwise, I'm pretty chill. Don't be rude (if you are rude to me after the round while I give my RFD, I WILL dock you speaker points. I expect you to be respectful to me as you would be respectful to your opponents. Why would you want to be rude to the person in charge of whether you win or not?) and explain your arguments well, that's all I ask.
Happy debating!
