Short Version:
Do what your good at, and at the end of the round you should be fine.

Long Version:
In high school I read hard core policy aff’s, and was a DA, Case and Kritik debater on the neg.

DAs:
Love DA, case debates. In high school I went for politics all the time.

CPs:
Case specific CPs are great and will get you good speaks if clearly articulated. I am not a fan of generic process CPs, I tend to err aff on theory pushes, but can be convinced otherwise. Generic word PICs suck. Specific PICs are great.

Kritiks:
Specific link and alt explanation will reward you. However, do not assume that I know the literature behind your kritik as well as you do.

Topicality:
I default to competing interpretations.

Performance:
Clearly articulate your method.

Kritical Aff’s:
Fine by me, but make sure you know what your talking about, have a defense of what your talking about, and clearly explain to me what your argument is.

Theory:
Generally believe that two conditional options is good, but can be convinced otherwise. Three is pushing it, and four or more is definitely absurd.

General:
Be polite and nice in CX- this doesn’t mean you can’t be firm or persistent. Smart and strategically used CX will get you a long way with speaker points
Evidence comparison is great
DO NOT clip cards. If I catch you, I will give you zero speaker points
Good jokes are awesome
Clarity over speed
