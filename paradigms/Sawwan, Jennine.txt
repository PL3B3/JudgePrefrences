  Generally, I will not do work for you during the round. However, you cannot expect me to be completely objective. If you're claiming something that is nonsensical, don't expect me to vote on it, unless your opponent ignores it.

I am human. So I have preferences and things I really don't want to see in a round.

First, I want both debaters to have fun. I want you to smile at least once during the round, and I don't want it because you realize your opponent dropped one of your points.

So specifics:

Theory: I am okay with theory. Although, if I hear you use it in every round, your credibility is going under. I want there to be a valid reason that it's being used, and it should be debated comprehensively.

Speed: I can understand you if you're articulate. But I will admit, I don't like it. I almost wrote a speed K in high school and my opinions on it destroying the sport has not changed.

Ks: I love Ks. But because I love them so much, my standards for the name is higher than average. If you are going to run a K, you must thoroughly explain why you are running this particular K, and the impacts that come off it on the flow. Links are also important.

Cross X is my favorite part of the round, because it really gives me a window to how each of you think and are strategic. Its a way to show me how smart you are. It kind of ruins it if you're sitting there and prepping instead.

Most importantly, I want both of you to be smart. This means no low hits; try and make the round more intellectually interactive than "s/he dropped X, Y and Z."

Have fun, and make it fun for me too.
