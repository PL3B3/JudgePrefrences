  I've been judging high school debate since 2001. I participated in policy debate for two years in high school('98,'99). I've attended NCFL's and NFL's for the past 7 years as both an assistant coach and a judge.

I am easily persuaded by fully developed, clearly presented, and detailed arguments. Trust me this is harder than you think. I'm looking for a policy option or some action to take or even just stand for, but you have to tell me which of these is going to happen with a ballot for your team. In a round where both teams do this convincingly I'll then look at how well you are able to understand your opponent's position and how well you counter. 

Topicality and Politics are my two least favorite arguements but only because they seem to not have much impact in the end of the a round. If these are your best arguments go for it, but make it matter in the round. Any argument that wastes time is frowned upon. Everyone seems to enjoy running Critiques these days and I'm game to hear it all, however I advise teams to be extra thorough with their explanations of how the K is changing the way I look at the round.

Typically my ballot goes to the team that is able to present the clearest argument and is also then able to defend that argument while taking their opponent's points into consideration. Constructive speeches draw outlines and rebuttals should color in and highlight winning positions. Education and entertainment are my top two standards so have fun and share with me what you know.
