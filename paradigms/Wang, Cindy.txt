  I am a parent judge for Randolph High School (NJ).

Do not spread or read off cases. Read slowly and clearly. If you think you are too fast, you probably are too fast. I will try to evaluate the round as objectively as possible, but I will not be able to understand most circuit norms. Please run the traditional value criterion and contention model of debate. Do not run theory or kritiks.
