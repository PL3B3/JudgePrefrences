I have been judging for the past 3 years.

Judge philosophy-
For the most part this is your burden. I will evaluate any argument as you want me to.
1. As far as speed, be clear. I don't care how fast you go as long as you're still actually saying words.
2. I rarely vote on potential abuse for Topicality or on theory.
3. I'm okay with critical/performance affs as well as for the neg side. You all just have to tell me how to evaluate it.
4. If you are going to run a K, understand it. They can be educational, but just saying a whole bunch of jargon won't help you get my vote. I also don't like "reject the Aff" alternatives. In my mind those types of alternatives are usually very vague for me, unless proven otherwise, which is rare. Which means you would rarely see me vote on vague alternatives.
5. Good line-by-line, sign posting are also preferable!
