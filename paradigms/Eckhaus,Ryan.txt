  Debated for 4 years for McDonogh/Capitol Debate (Class of 2015)
email: sreckhaus@mcdonogh.org

Top Level:
- I debated lots of different styles of arguments in high school but I am most familiar with straight up policy debates. That being said I evaluate everything and anything on the flow and that is what ultimately guides my decision.
- I will call for evidence that I believe is necessary to resolve important questions in the debate
- No prep for flashing or other tech stuffs unless it gets egregious
- TKOs are in play -- if you think the other team has made a mistake that cannot be recovered from (e.g. dropped t or condo) you can stake the debate on there being no feasible way I vote for the other team. If you're right you win, if not you lose.
- An argument needs a claim and a warrant (important)
- Cheap Shot Theory/Args --- it really depends I’m not a big fan but I’ll vote on them. It really depends what goes down in rounds
- Do whatever you want in CX but don’t be too over the top… there is a fine line.
- Card Clipping is baaaad "Clipping: Any misrepresentation of evidence read in round whether intentional or not, mismarking cards included. Video evidence must be presented that was consented to before the round.” I won’t be looking for clipping but if I think anything is up I may start following along with speech docs
- I'll update my wiki as things come up

T:
- Ground and Fairness are internal links not impacts
- Default to reasonability
- It comes down to who’s vision of the topic is better
- Aff is mostly gonna win this on defense so the aff also needs to find some offense to give the judge
- If you really think your aff is T, be bold and go for W/M
- DO IMPACT CALC – this rarely happens in T debate and can really change decisions

DAs/Impact Turns:
- These are Awesome
- Politics was probably the #1 thing I most researched in high school. I think it is a silly somewhat contrived DA but that being said it’s awesome for debate. I love a good throwdown on this
- Turns Case and Impact Calc should most likely start in the block and needs warranted analysis
- Impact Turns are sorta the bees knees for the neg depending on how the topic turns out. Well executed impact turns = big speaks

CPs:
- Advantage CPs are cool but usually weak
- Specific CPs are cool
- Cheating Generic Process CPs are meh but can still be utilized

Theory:
- 2AC always needs at least one theory argument
- Condo is the only theoretical voting issue unless stated otherwise
- I’m very in the middle on theory but being a former 2A I lean a little aff

Ks:
- I ran some flavor of race kritik almost every neg round of my career
- I’m familiar with some of the most popular Ks like Security and Cap but I’m not into any other lit like high theory
- Aff should really be attacking the alt hard
- Links to the aff are better the more specific they get. That being said you don’t need evidence if you can come up with a persuasive analytic reason why the specific plan is a direct example of what you’re K’ing
- Neg will usually lose if they don’t have an external impact
- Perm is super useful for the aff in these debates
- 1ar needs to make sure they don’t drop K tricks

Framework:
- I’m open to all styles of affs. That being said you need to be able to defend something
- I’ve gone back and forth on this argument during my high school career and ended up somewhere in the middle
- Case is usually offense vs. f/w in these debate so aff should use the 1ac as leverage and the neg should make sure not to drop case in the 2nr or at least have f/w arguments that interact with the case
- Fairness is a good internal link but not an impact. Things like advocacy skills and clash are impacts
- You need to be able to go for this argument somewhat competently

“No Plan” affs:
- Aff gets a perm unless the neg argues otherwise
- Neg should call out the aff when they try to no link impact turns aka “not our baudrillard”

Speaks:
- 28.5 is where I’ll start the debate at and then move up and down from there
- Speaker Points will reflect how well you debated and how well you conducted yourself during speeches and throughout the entirety of our interaction as well.
- I'll get mad if i have to call clear more than once. Make sure you are somewhat comprehensible when reading cards. I don't need to hear every single word in a piece of evidence but i need to know that you are actually saying something coherent

Random Ways to boost speaker points:
- Pop culture/Sports references
- Being funny
- impact turn in the 2ac/1ar (see Westminster FG)
- Great strategies/Risky strategies
- Don’t use all prep (and win)
- Making fun of Michael Koo/Simon Park or other people I’m friends with
