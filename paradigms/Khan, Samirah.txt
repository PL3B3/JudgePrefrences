  Background:
I have competed in Public Forum for two years while in high school and have judged PF a few times as well. I am a freshman in college and currently do not compete in debate. 

Judge Philosophy:
Speaking clearly and at a reasonable speed (not too fast) is very important to me. I highly value using logic and evidence in your cases. Have strong cards to support your arguments and be able to clearly weigh why your arguments outweigh your opponentâ€™s arguments. 

I also think it is important to clearly break down your opponents case. Go through each of their contentions and explain why they do not stand in the round or why they do not outweigh yours. Expand on your arguments and ask questions that will help you strengthen your case. I love crossfire and believe this is the time to really solidify why I should vote pro/con.

As a judge, I do not disclose results.

Finally, please be civil and respectful to opponents during the round!
