  Here's the DL:
Slightly above average judge; debated throughout high school, but wasn't anything exceptional. I don't debate in college. Regardless, I know the lingo, the arguments, how to flow, can keep up with speed, etc.Run whatever argument you want, however you have to make sure you debate it properly and well. Please refrain from performance affs. I'm fine with ptx, but I have a high threshold on good ptx debate.I'm lazy. Do analysis, point out critical warrants for me. Read all the cards you want, but if you won't take the time to explain them to me, I'm not to take the time to evaluate them. Also make distinctions between tags and cards, sign-post; clean flows = happy judge.When you spread, don't mumble.Paperless prep ends when usb is out of the computer. Stealing prep with paperless will result in bad speaks.Tag team cross-x is fine.Biggest pet peeve (and greatest contributor to loss of speaker points) is parroting. The purpose of debate (besides for fun) is education; blankly repeating words is NOT education.Second biggest pet peeve is excessive intimidation. I went through it and it's creepy feeling someone's breath on your neck when you're doing a line-by-line.
Best wishes,
