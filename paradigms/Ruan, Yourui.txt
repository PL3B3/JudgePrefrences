  Background:
Former LD and PF debater. Debated on the circuit in both and went to camp for 3 summers. Other than judging Blue Key last year, I have not been involved in the debate scene since I was in high school. 

Paradigms:

1. I'm open to any and all arguments, really. Though I do really enjoy strategic arguments.
2. Not a fan of slower and boring rounds.
3. I will be fine with speed and will be able to follow up on the flow
4. I need to be able to comprehend an argument in order to vote for it. Intricate and highly specific arguments will need to be explained. 
5. Unless told otherwise, I will default to "fairness is a voter."
6. Be civilized
7. Don't be sloppy with arguments, always try to number or letter them.
8. Explain your extensions
9. Provide me with a weighing mechanism to weigh arguments or I will weigh them for you.
