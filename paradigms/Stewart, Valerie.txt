  I am the coach at Cleveland High School in Reseda, CA. I have been coaching speech and debate for about 10 years, both in California and Wisconsin.

I don't particularly like spreading, but I'm ok with a 'medium' spreading-- I need to be able to understand you. If I've stopped writing and look confused, then you need to slow down.

I don't like topicality debates, but occasionally they are warranted. If the argument is wildly off topic, then run the topicality argument. Please do not turn every debate into a semantic argument. I find that in LD and Policy, most arguments can be debated. I'd rather watch a lively debate on an issue than a tired and lame argument about topicality.

I like to be given voters. I am a flow judge, but I like an analysis of what points have been dropped and where the opponent's argument was weak. Especially in high school debates, I like to see that each side can point to where they have addressed each issue.
