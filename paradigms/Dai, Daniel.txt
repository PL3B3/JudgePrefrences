Iowa City West

Experience: This is my first year judging. I started policy debate in Sophomore year of high school at Iowa City West and debated two years varsity. I’ve covered the Renewable Energy, Poverty, and Troop Withdrawal topics.

Arguments: I’m generally open to any arguments as long as you seem to know what you’re talking about. I like to see a good link debate, and of course, impact calculus. Make sure you have your link story clear, nothing looks worse than reading an Obama good link on an Obama bad DA. In terms of impact calculus, merely saying “we outweigh on magnitude” doesn’t do it. Compare the impacts and tell why yours is bigger than theirs.

Kritiks are fine to run with me too. I liked running Foucault and Securitization in high school. Make sure to have a clear alternative and tell me what it does. Tell me what the role of the ballot is and what I’m supposed to do as a judge. I don’t like making your decisions for you.

I will vote on theory and T if there is sufficient work done. Don’t just read your blocks. Give some impact calculus and show why your standards are better than theirs, or why you have the better access to education and whatnot.

Other: Tag team cross-x is fine. Be polite to your partner, even if they suck. Oftentimes the rude partner is actually the one that doesn’t know what they are talking about. I’m going to quote my good friend David Huang here and say that “ it is your job to earn my ballot, so though I make mistakes, my decision is only ‘wrong’ when you failed to do your job”.
