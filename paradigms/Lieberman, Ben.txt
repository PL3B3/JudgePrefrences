  I prefer logical, clear and precise arguments. I appreciate clear introductions to your value and criterion and a logical outline of contentions. Feel free to engage in a vigorous, professional cross examination. If you are making a key point or argument or if you are trying to lay the groundwork for your position, whether that is through your contentions or a turn, make that clear. I also appreciate a focused conclusion with a clear guide to crystallization points and voters. Please do not spread. I also am not likely to favor a debater who tries to win mainly by trying to convince me that he or she is employing an inherently fancier approach.
