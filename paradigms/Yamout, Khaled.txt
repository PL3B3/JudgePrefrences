  I am a parent judge from La Costa Canyon High School. I have never debated.

Speed - Feel free to go as fast as you'd like for the text of cards, as long as you are VERY slow and clear for tag lines. Your rebuttals should be slow.

Critical arguments - I'm not familiar with them, and would strongly advise against going for them (translation: DO NOT run them. You will not win.)

If you want to know anything more specific, ask me before the round begins.
