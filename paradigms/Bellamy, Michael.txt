  Debate is about logic, but it is also about persuasion. It doesn't matter who is right, if the judge wasn't convinced of it. With that in mind, things like behavior, speaking clearly, and manners will all influence my, (or any judge's) decision in some way.Most of my experience comes from PF, but I've watched and judged multiple LD rounds as well.Following the flow, if an argument is dropped, that will have a huge impact.I enjoy debates revolving around the moral issues of the resolution, or simply weighing pros/cons. I like the amount of clash it produces. Spending 25% of a speech on a trivial definition in the resolution is far less important than the real claims that should have been said instead.
