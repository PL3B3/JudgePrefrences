  I competed in policy debate for four years during high school but I haven't really been involved in the debate circuit since I graduated five years ago. I don't have a ton of experience in LD debate, but I like debates that argue about values and criterion. Paint a picture for me/tell me a story on the ethicality of your case. 

Speed is fine. Go as fast as you would like, just be CLEAR.

My judging philosophy is simple: make it as easy as possible for me to know who to vote for. I am really open minded and will go for any argument, as long as it is well thought out, compelling and makes sense in round. I hate it when it becomes a whining round of abuse or unfairness or topicality. Keep calm and roll with the punches. But seriously, tell a good story for your case, make my job easy and you will get my vote.
