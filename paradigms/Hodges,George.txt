I have judged prelim and out rounds in both High School and Collegiate tournaments.
I will listen to any position that your team wishes to deploy.I will default to/vote for the team that best articulates their argument and then explains why theirs is best.Theory and any other debate mechanism will win or lose you the round. It is up to you to convince me of yours being best.Cards and warrants win rounds however, a well thought out and presented analytic can be a game-changer.T is a great argument so long as you tell me why it is a good/bad argument in your round.Resolution/No resolution, Plan/No plan.....your call. Speaker points are subjective to each round so respect your opponents and the space, speak clearly, concisely, and professionally. your speaks will be high. Not to do so, not so high.
