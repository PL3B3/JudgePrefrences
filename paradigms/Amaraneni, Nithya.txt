  I debated in Georgia at Wheeler High School for three years and I now am a freshman at Emory--however I am not on the debate team.
Note: I have not judged any rounds on this years topic, but I have kept in touch with the high school debate circut and know a bit about whats going on.
A few things about me:
I'm fine with speed, just make sure you're clear. I'm a fan of evidence comparison and would rather not have to be pulling cards at the end of the round. Please please please be nice in CX---it goes a long way. Jokes are great, have fun, make the round interesting.
Kritiks: To be honest, I don't have a alot of experience with the K, and you will probably have to work hard to get me to vote on one--ie clearly explain not only the k on the link level, but also be sure to explain what the alt is, how it functions, and what type of framework I should be viewing the round in.
Counterplans: Love 'em--solvency on the CP is a burden on the negative, not a way to make the aff justify their actor/mechanism etc.
Disads: Fine, make sure to explain the link and such
Topicality: I'm willing to be persuaded to vote for T, just make sure to do the work, and actually impact T out; don't bother making rvis... they are silly.
Theory: To be honest, its going to be an uphill battle to get me to vote on things like plan flaw, aspec, conditionality, etc.
Case debate: I'm a fan of a good case debate--however inherency is going to be a tough sell
Performance: I need you to explain it to me the purpose of your aff, where it is relavant, and what my job in your 'movent' is.
Most importantly--Have fun--and I'll vote wherever you tell me
