  Ks will need more explanation for me, especially k tricks and perms. Framework on ks needs to be coherent in all speeches for me to vote on itI vote for anything as long as it's well explained. I am not super familiar with k's and framework, so make sure there's extra and coherent explanations on those.Please emphasize any voters or reasons to reject the team.Tag teaming is ok as long as you don't overpower the partner who is asking/ answering questions.Please be considerate and polite; if you are rude or condescending in crossex or blatantly insult the other team, I will dock your speaks.If you are a novice, please try and be quick with flashing/sending files. I don't take prep for either of those unless it's an excessive amount of time.If you do start an email chain, my email is lydiamoll625@gmail. Feel free to send me any questions there after the round as well.For spreading, I prefer clarity. If you are too fast and/or unclear, I might miss some arguments, and even if you said something crucial, you want to make sure it's on my flow or else I won't vote on it.Please be slower with theory arguments!Once prep time is over, stop talking to your partner/typing/writing/clicking. I'll warn you the first time, but after that, I will take your prep and probably dock your speaks.Time your own speeches and prep. I will also be timing it in case there's a mishap, but it's best to manage your own time accordingly instead of relying on me to do it for you.Signposting is very important! Please do that so I don't get lost in your speech.
