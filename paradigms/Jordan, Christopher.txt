Competed for 4 years in high school, graduated in 2014

I think framework debate is the most important part of the round. It is necessary that both debaters set up some standard (wahtever form that takes) by which I as the judge can evaluate impacts and engage each other on which standard I should use. I won't evaluate any offense that doesn't link to the standard I decide won the framework debate.

I default to competing interps and RVIs on theory

I have a high threshold for extensions- please extend by author name and warrant to show what you're going for. 

I won't vote on arguments supported by cards that don't have warrants. 

I haven't dug in and read K lit since high school so I get the arguments, but please don't assume I know your author/lit. 

Iâ€™ll say clear or speed no more than twice 

First time judging a circuit tournament in over a year so not necessarily up with the community, and might be a step behind on speed. The best thing would be to slow down a bit for tags and pause after author names.
