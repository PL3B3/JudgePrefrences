I will support and evaluate any form of debate that you find educational and useful for yourself. That means that I am comfortable watching and evaluating "standard debate", flowing line-by-line and listening to the case and T-debate. I would also enjoy and support other forms of engagement with the topic and debate community whatever they might be. 
I would be flexible in flowing the way you want me to and evaluating the "performative" arguments that aren't necessarily theoretical. 
I find myself rewarding debaters who are passionate and care about their specific form of debating ( "traditional" or otherwise), and the debate community in general with high speaker points. Below are a few things you could find useful, BUT how the specific debate develops might change them; I'm also open to be persuaded otherwise. 

"Traditional" way of engaging the topic - 
- if you're going for T, extend your interpretation in every speech and very clearly/specifically. Assume I'm not very familiar with the topic's limits & ground
- if you run framework, be very specific in terms of the topic-education that you did not gain in this specific debate round. I do find most aff's that kritik the political and social institutions and/or have a relation (even if it's not very direct) to the topic to be topical. You've got to be more specific than "they did not talk about USFG, therefore we lose education." Arguments that it is unfair and/or you lose ground are harder to persuade me to vote for. 
- if the argument in any flow is conceded but not explained, do not assume that I will automatically vote for you. Explain how it relates to the rest of the debate. 

Other forms of engaging the topic - 
- I really enjoy those debates and find performance, personal narratives, music, pictures, cultural artifacts etc. to be arguments. I will be fine with evaluating them against theoretical arguments that the other teams makes if you ask me to do so. 
- I'm find myself looking at a bigger picture and evaluating the entirety of the debate in those rounds. Meaning that it is very important for you to control the framing/role of the judge and ballot. If you win the framing of the round, I'm more likely to vote on that vs. a small dropped argument that does not challenge that framing. 

Being respectful to the other team in forms of listening, speaking and argumentative engagement will positively impact your speaker points. 

Good luck!
