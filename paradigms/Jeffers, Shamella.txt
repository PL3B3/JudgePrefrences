Debating for 4 years reaching the T.O.C 

About me
I have done mainly performance/not traditional affs and K debates. I feel as if debate is about persuasion, if you cant do that then you cannot get my ballot. I strongly believe that debate is a site for pedagogical engagement, and showing what you can do in terms of liberation for oppressed groups DO NOT expect to read 6 different offs with different scenarios and expect to get my ballot. I prefer hearing in depth arguments especially if you can explain your argument without using massive amounts of cards, hence the term depth over breath. I was also not much of a techy db8er. I also appreciate a good impx calc & R.O.B db8's, those are fun.

K
I do lean more towards a good k debate but that doesn't mean you cannot win with out running one. 

Performance 
I view this as a stylistic form of db8. If you do performance go all out, there's nothing I haven't seen before. But with performance I need to know what that means for the ballot, does it hold any weight? is performance just and answer to an arg? Tell me why your performance or lack there of is key. 

Methodology 
With k's and performance comes methodology db8's you need to explain why your method of solving for oppression or the promotion of liberation either via the k or performance or what ever you're running is better than that of the other team 

Fw
Um this could be a brolic arg in terms of how you spin it THE ONLY way I would consider voting on fw is if it comes down heavily on the educational value of db8 or any systemic harms. The framing of the db8 round or of certain args is something that could help just make sure you can defend it.
