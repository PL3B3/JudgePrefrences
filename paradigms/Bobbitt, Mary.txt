1. Experience: Four years Broad Run high school debate, first year at Liberty University debate.
2. Slow down on theory and separate tags and you should be fine with speed
3. 2NR Favorites (In order of how much I like them): K, Process CP, Politics+case, PIC + net benefit, Impact turning advs, T
I prefer kritikal style impacts or interesting strategies. Making debate interesting makes it, well, interesting. And it becomes more fun for all of us.
4. FW: K's are acceptable. I have a higher threshold for non-plan text affs on framework and performance--that doesn't mean you shouldn't run it, just be able to defend framework. I enjoy interesting kritikal strategies.
5. Theory: Condo is probably good. Unless there is clear abuse. Let me reiterate--slow down on theory.
6. Humor is good, sarcasm is appreciated, irony as well. Please do not insult or harass your opponents
7. I tend to default to reasonability
8. I am not up on the high school debate literature--space is uniquely foreign to me. Please explain your acronyms and technical terms.
9. Quals are not arguments. This is so annoying--referencing and knowing your authors is good, referencing and knowing your arguments is better. Doing both and you'll be good. Just referencing a card by the cite probably won't help you, especially in fast debates.
10. If a piece of evidence is questionable or contested I will call for it, but I believe that debate should be left up to the debaters--pull out the warrants.
