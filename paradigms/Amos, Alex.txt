  Debater on the Cameron University Debate Team, Lawton Oklahoma
LD Paradigm
I have competed, taught, or seen any and all debate styles. If it's a strategy you think you can win with I will listen to it but know if you don't do it well I won't vote. Speed is fine. I prefer traditional debate but as I said, I'll listen to anything you have.
