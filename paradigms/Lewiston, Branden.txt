  My background is primarily in policy debate, which you should keep in mind. However, with regards to LD:1) I use the strongest criterion in the round to evaluate the debate. This means that winning the line-by-line without clearly linking your arguments to the criterion will not get you for. Macro-level discussion is important.2) I don't have strong biases for certain types of arguments, and I'm open to experimentation. If you want to go traditional, that is fine. If you want to be more radical or critical, that is fine too. 3) I am fine with theoretical arguments, so long as the impact and weighing mechanism is clearly explained. I'm not predisposed to certain theoretical arguments over others.If you have any specific questions before the round, please feel free to ask.
