  Judging Philosophy:

1. If I couldn't understand your argument due to speed or overall comprehension, I won't hold the other debater / debaters to challenge it.
2. I can flow, but if both parties agree for me not to, wthout flowing, I have a greater oppertunity to pay attention to quality of arguments rather than quantity of them.
3. I believe debate is subjective, and thus if one party has more arguments carried over, they will not be guaranteed a victory. I must truly be convinced that your arguments are valid and that you understand them.
