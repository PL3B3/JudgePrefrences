  Hey guys,

I'm Michael Lin, I debated for St. Ignatius College Prep for four years from 2006-2010. I'm now a freshman at Berkeley and this will be my first year judging. 

I am OK with any speed, but clarity is an absolute must. I'll yell clear twice before I start docking speaks. I am open to all types of arguments and case types, although I do not have the best understanding of critical arguments/dense philosophy, so if you run them, run them slowly and explain them clearly. Theory is fine with me, you do not need clear abuse to run it. However, the more frivolous the theory the more lenient I will be in buying responses to it. RVI's are fine for me too. I expect to average somewhere between 27.5-28 speaks and we go up and down from there. The better the case, argumentation, clarity of arguments, quality of arguments, strategy, means higher speaks. The less intervention I have to do, and the easier job you give me means you will enjoy higher speaks. I enjoy hearing unique arguments, and am a fan of good evidence. I also want to see good weighing between arguments and will give it a lot of weight when deciding what to vote on. I will default to a competing worlds framework unless a different, well justified framework is presented and won. I like to be entertained, but do not be rude. If you have any more questions, ask before the round. Good luck with your debating!
