  Seen and judged a few rounds before, but they were all lay. Knowing that, in order for me to judge your round as accurate as possible, please keep it as lay as possible. If you are going to run anything I might not have encountered before, make sure to explain it well in round. If you explain it well, I will vote for it.

Speed: Don't go fast or I won't understand you and you will probably lose.

K's: I'm fine with these arguments, just don't make it super wacky or esoteric.

Theory: Don't frivolous theory because I can't evaluate it well. With that being said, if there is real abuse run a shell but make sure you are explaining every part to me.

Voting: I will vote for the person who wins the most important arguments in round that impact back to the framework (also please do that, impact args to the framework). 

Speaks: Be confident, eloquent and nice.
