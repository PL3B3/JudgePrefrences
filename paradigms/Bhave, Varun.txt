  I did four years of national circuit and local LD at Del Mar/Torrey Pines, graduating in 2015. I would prefer to see your own approach to the round, and do not want to impose rigid beliefs about debate on you. The judges that I respected most were open-minded and spent time trying to make the right decisions. 

Princeton '17 update: I'm enjoying a comfortable retirement from debate. However, everything written below is still true. Showcasing your ability to generate and interact clever arguments is the road to higher speaker points, but I can be impressed by many, many different strategies.

Just a few more things:
1. I simply cannot process some rates of delivery, so you should slow down on tags and short analytics. Also emphasize author names and important parts of evidence.

2. I tend to flow arguments by content and sometimes miss numbers and letters. Referencing arguments by the claim or concept would be preferable in rebuttals.

3. If I say "clear" or "slow," I've probably missed a couple of sentences; it could be worth backtracking a little bit.

4. I have a low threshold for extensions of conceded arguments, but need more explanation if you're doing any comparison.

5. I would rather not be forced to default on important paradigm issues. 

If you have questions, please ask before the round. Exude passion, but don't take yourself too seriously. It's most enjoyable to watch debaters who seem to be having fun.
