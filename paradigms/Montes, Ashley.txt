  Background: I’ve debated in high school and I am currently an undergrad at the University of California: Berkeley.
Overall: I believe that in debate one should focus on the quality of the argument not so much
the quantity. Thus, do not throw large amounts of information around the room without having
it be relevant and having it be clear as to why it is relevant to the argument you are making at
the time. Have evidence on board, BUT remember to be more engaged in the debate in regards
to applying logic and strong analytics. Be careful when using DAs/CPs as most debaters I see are
unable to follow through with their initial strategies.
For LD focus on your speed and don’t get ahead of yourself. I will be able to follow along, but
the presentation of evidence (and again quality) is incredibly important in convincing me.
Remember to signpost as it will help me better understand the flow or your argument. Make
sure that you are direct and clear about the links of each individual contention and its value.
Kritiks need to be clear in their structure and statements; I’ve seen many debaters confuse
themselves by attempting to run a Kritik than anything else.
Lastly, remember that debate is an intellectual endeavor. That being said, please remain
conscientious of current events and mind your manners (do not be rude to your opponent). You
should be learning something from every debate.
