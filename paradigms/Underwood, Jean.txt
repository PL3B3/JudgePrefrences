  I'm a lay-judge coach from Atlantic High School.

1) Speed: Don't go fast at all and speak clearly. If you go fast, I will not follow what you said, and being that I vote off of who convinces me of their side the most, me following what you say is pretty important. I cannot stress this enough. I teach speech and believe in the idea of Speech and debate. It cannot just be content, form matters too, and that includes a good pace and plenty of clarity/articulation.

2) I do NOT know/like any progressive argument- no theory, K's, plans, counterplans, etc. Keep it old school- a nice philosophical debate, I need to understand arguments in order to weigh them.

3) As stated earlier, I vote off of persuasion. I do not flow intently but if it is pointed out that you dropped an argument, it will be weighed. If the flow is upheld for the most part by both debaters, than I vote off of whoever persuaded me the most- it is debate, after all. I will not vote off of counter-intuitive silly contentions, regardless of how they're flowed. I'm just not going to buy them.

4) I'm not strict enough on the flow to catch every little detail, but I do follow the big picture.

5) Be polite and Civil in Cx. VERY important to me.

Have fun, be nice, and have a good moral/philosophical debate and you'll be sure to win my ballot or at least have good speaker points!
