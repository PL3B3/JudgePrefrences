  I have been judging LD for the past 10 years. 

When I judge I want good reliable sources that gives me evidence that makes me think. I make decisions based on the evidence you give me.  I will give as many critiques as possible.  This is a learning experience for everyone.  During the entire round everyone will be respectful of others in the room. Debaters will be respectful upwards each other especially during cross x. You can make your point without yelling and making the other debater feel like they don't know their case.

We are here to have fun
