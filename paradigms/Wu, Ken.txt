  Be aware: I am a laymen/parent judge. I have limited experience judging LD (only experience as being novice LD judge at 42nd Harvard Invitation last year. This will be my first time judging varsity.

Let me be up front that I am not technical (so I will not be able to judge on technicality) and I do not appreciate speed. I appreciate concise, effective argument without jamming the audience with machine gun style speed reading. I look for clarity, logical reasoning, critical thinking, and convincing argument during round. I will do my best to be fair and balance in judging.

I award speaker point based on fluency and clarity in your argument, overall gestures and composure of your presentation. I not only value what you say, but also how you say it, and how you impress and influence the audience. If I understand the presidential debate on TV, I should be able to understand your argument. You would not do well if I cannot follow your argument, or you argument confuses me or logically does not make sense to me. It would be to your advantage if you clearly state or emphasize your VC and contentions.
