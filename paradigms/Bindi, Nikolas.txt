  I debated all four years of high school in both PF and Student Congress, and have had experience judging LD for my high school team. I don't like spreading but if it is necessary I can keep up with most speeds. I believe this is a debate, not an argument, so that means whoever talks the loudest or prettiest will not win, but whoever presents the best arguments. I very much enjoy framework arguments for they show me how to judge the debate. Tell me impacts and why I should care about what you are saying and why you are winning, don't leave me to decide. Finally I do pay attention to cross-fire and I feel that it is a valuable part of the debate.
