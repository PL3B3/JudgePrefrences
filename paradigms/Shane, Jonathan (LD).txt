Personal History: I debated PF and LD simultaneously for all 4 years of high school. I'm a freshman at Georgia State U right now and I do policy debate. I have judged about 10 LD rounds this year.

-I want the debaters to do the work in my rounds. I don't want my philosophy of debate to impact your style, you should do what you're comfortable with.

-Since LD is kind of on the brink of turning into policy debate, speed is a somewhat important issue. I, personally, can listen to you spread and flow it pretty comfortably because I do policy now. If you are debating against a speed talker and have no idea what they're saying, I am also perfectly willing to hear a good ol' fashion theory throw down about how speed has transformed LD into policy's retarded baby brother and how we should go back to the PF style. I'm not saying I will always vote on theory arguments, but LD is inherently a philosophical debate that can sometimes go off-topic. Since some simply cannot handle the spread, this seems to be the only viable check on that power.

-construction of the Aff Case and Neg Case is the most important thing to me. Don't be afraid to use a lot of evidence from crazy philosophy books but at the same time don't be afraid to throw in some personal analysis. Just be persuasive and don't waste time with stupid case filler. I know that's somewhat vague, but it's all I ask for and you'd be suprised how often people cannot meet those two objectives.

-I love it when you use specific philosophical arguments instead of generalized advocacies. at the very least it will get you higher speaks with me. Examples: Foucault's biopower, Agamben's State of Exception, Deleuze's Nomadic thought. If you can drop these big fluffy concepts in front of me and actually explain what they mean in a coherent way while making clear links to your opponent's case, I will have trouble voting against you.

-questions before round are welcomed. Just be strategic, clever, humorous and have fun.
