  I prefer to think of my guiding paradigm as tabula rasa. If we judges bring our personal views on a topic into the room, then there is little point to the debate, just ask me my opinion and that side wins.

With that being said, I will flow and try and judge my final decision on who wins the most points and the most important points. Don't drop points and do not drop your value if you feel it is the best measurement for the round.

Lastly, don't try and get cute and tell me your opponent is being abusive by doing x, y, or z. Show me you notice when they drop points, don't leave it up to me. I do everything I can to be a blank slate and let the two debaters mold my opinion in the room, in the round. If any of this is unclear, I have no problem addressing each of you before a round begins.
