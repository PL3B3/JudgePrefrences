  High School: Torrey Pines High School

Background:
I debated for about two years for Torrey Pines High School in LD. I did more lay than flow.

Because of that, I’m familiar with but less comfortable with more flow-type arguments. If you’re running theory, T, k’s, etc., please slow down and clearly explain the argument. If I can’t understand it, I really won’t be able to judge on it. Finally, spread at your own risk. If you’re difficult to understand, I’ll say “clear”, but again, if I can’t understand you, it’s going to be much harder to judge you. 

Otherwise, I’ll be looking for good evidence, clear roadmapping, extensions with warrants—in essence, all the things that will help me understand your position. I’ll be flowing the round, and speaks will be on a 25-30 scale, 25 being completely terrible and 30 being absolutely fantastic.

Good luck!
