  I’m a former HS policy debater (3 yrs.) and value debater (1yr.) turned trial lawyer.

Although I would like to judge rounds as a table rasa, I don’t. I’m not sure I can. I decide rounds like a judge would in a bench trial. All aspects of a debater’s performance are evaluated including the quality of the arguments presented, the professionalism of the competitors, and their overall persuasiveness.

If you are paying attention during your speeches, you’ll probably know which arguments I’m buying, which arguments I’m interested in, and which arguments I think are garbage. I am not an expert on your topic or your case. It is your job to educate me thoroughly. Never assume I know what an acronym means until you tell me.

My ears can handle spreading if it is clear. My hands cannot handle spreading if it is fast. Please read your tags and sources VERY SLOWLY to ensure that I flow them properly.

I’m also an Aquarius. I love my wife, my dogs, stylish western wear, and the music of Bob Dylan.

Good luck.
