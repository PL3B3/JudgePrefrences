  I debated four years at Edmond North High School
In high school I read mostly kritikal arguments, but I still understand and will vote on policy arguments. The main thing I ask for is impact comparison. I enjoy a good theory debate. I would not say I have any prejudices regarding theory and will evaluate those arguments based on the flow. 
I have not judged any rounds on this topic, so I may not be the best T judge. However, I definitely will vote on T you just need to be very clear about how the aff is not topical and examples will go along way to help me out. 
If you read a kritik in front of me I would appreciate if you were very clear on the link debate. 
Also, speed is fine.

If you have any questions feel free to ask
