  I debated at KCKCC for 2-3 years depending on your definition. 
I debated at Illinois State University some as well.
Currently an assistant coach at KCKCC

Was a CC national champion in debate while at KCKCC.

All arguments are ok. If you run a K make sure the Alt is clear. Explain the Impacts.

CP/Disad Debate--cool. Again, make sure the links are well developed and impacts are weighed.
Turns to the above--cool. Make sure the turns are clear especially if the Neg did a poor job kicking out of something.

I went for theory A LOT!! A LOT. If you go for it, fine. Give me pen time to get the warrants.

Speed is fine, Be Clear. I love the Chiefs. You should too! : )
