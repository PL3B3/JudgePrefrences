  Hi! I'm Ben and I debated LD at Hunter High School for four years. My senior year, I earned 3 TOC bids. I worked as an instructor at NSD this summer. I currently attend Princeton University and coach Madi Norman from Princeton High School.

I'm going to keep it short and hopefully write a longer paradigm at a later date. I'm good with any argument as long as its warranted (with the caveat that you should not make people uncomfortable/unable to debate). I'll try to be objective in evaluating my flow, but I do think that being clear and convincing probably sways me a bit. Don't assume that you should debate like how I debated to get my ballot. Engage in arguments and don't be annoying. If theres a new off in every speech I will be grumpy.
