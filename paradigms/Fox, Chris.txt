  Professionalism, civility, and respect are expected. I prefer quality of arguments over quantity of arguments. I am from New York, so I am used to some fast talking, but if you want me to flow your arguments accurately you should go at a human speed. I expect well organized and intelligent speeches with arguments that have been well developed, clearly explained, and strategically selected (go for the jugular of the round--the essentials--rather than spending all of your time on a wide range of unimportant, capillary issues). That selection should be based on a clearly articulated weighing mechanism. I am even more impressed when this intelligence is paired with powerful, persuasive, specific, clever rhetoric. We are allowed to have fun. Stay away from too much lingo or theory (Kritiks are not something I enjoy), and ground your arguments in carefully explained logic. I promise to do my best and expect you to do yours. When in doubt, just ask yourself what Lincoln and Douglas would think of the round. If they would be sad or confused, I probably am too.
