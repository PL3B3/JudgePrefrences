Which best describes your priorities to judging policy debate?
Communication skills and resolution of substantive issues are of equal importance.
Quality of evidence is more important than quantity of evidence.

Voting/judging Preferences
Prefer quality OVER quantity of arguments
*Clarity and logic matter more than anything!
I like a strong value criterion debate.
*I am good with speed-if you're really a speedster clarity is key (but I can keep up with national level policy speed)
*Theory is a voter-if you offer it up (counter-plans are included).
