  I debated at Dowling Catholic High School in Iowa for four years between 2006-2010. Currently, I am attending Northwestern University and am a junior in the class of 2014.

I am open to any position you might want to run. The only thing I ask you to do is to explain it and warrant your arguments. I am comfortable with pretty much every argument, but must say I am not very familiar with the topic this year, so topicality arguments will need to be explained a little more. 

If you have any other questions or I missed anything, feel free to ask before the round.
