  Hi all,

Case Western Reserve University '17
Bronx Science '13

I did policy debate at Bronx Science for about 4 years.
I don't have any knowledge of the current topic so please be sure to explain acronyms/ other topic related jargon

Topicality
You will make the most head way here by arguing for reasonable limits.

Kritiks vs Policy
I am much more familiar with the traditional policy style of debate. However, I will vote on the kritik, if you are able to explain it well enough that I understand it. 

Disads
You can win zero risk of a disad.
Impact calculus and framing is key.


Performance
I am strongly biased against performance arguments. I will vote on them but will probably give more leeway to strong framework arguments against them.


If you have any other questions just feel free to ask me before the round
