What do you think the Aff burdens should be?

Affirmative must provide a specific impetus for the world of their advocacy being uniquely beneficial compared to the status quo; affirmative can win a DA by taking out the negative’s links even if the affirmative loses uniqueness.

What do you think the Neg burdens should be?

Negative must show specific ground loss to win T.

How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)?

Fine with speed. The clearer a card is presented in the speech, the greater the chance that I will call for it after the round. Spirited debate over the interpretation of specific pieces of evidence also increases the chances that I will give examine cards. Conversely, the wholesale, “read this string of cards, they’re great” appeals do little to encourage post-round inspection.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks?

Politics DAs must have a carefully constructed story with evidential support for me to give them weight; magnitude typically outweighs timeframe in impact comparisons.


Counterplans are fine so long as it is clearly articulated how a permutation cannot subsume the counterplan’s intent.

I’m open to kritik arguments, but the following presumptions underlie my decision: 
1) I’m big on performative consistency, as I tend to believe that performative contradictions undermine the ethos of critics, especially when such critics present their arguments as pedagogical interventions.
2) The role of the ballot as an agent of change needs to be elucidated in order to provide a rationale for why they implication of kritiks are voting issues.
3) The most persuasive kritik arguments are supported by detailed and specific link analysis relating the terms of the kritik directly to opponents’ argumentation.

How I feel about case debates?

No issues.
