  I am currently a college freshman. I have four years of high school debate experience and competed in a number of tournaments, primarily on the West Coast.

In high school, I was a 1A/2N. I enjoy critical debate, but will always look to framework first in deciding a round. I have a high threshold on T and theory, and arguments must be impacted well for me to vote on them. I will not do any work for either team, nor will I call for evidence unless the evidence itself is being called into question and both teams fairly explicitly contradict each other on interpretations of evidence.
