  Experience: I have judged LD frequently on the local Texas (TFA) circuit and UIL for the last 3 years. I have no prior experience as a debater.

Paradigm: I don't go in a round with any preconceived notions. Whichever debater(s) has a better and more convincing argument is who I vote for. Since I don't have a debate background, I tend to go for the most well-thought out and convincing argument. I would prefer to hear quality clash on the substantive issues contained within the resolution. 

Speed: I prefer a conversational rate. 

Speaker Points: Be polite to each other or I may feel compelled to lower speaker points.
