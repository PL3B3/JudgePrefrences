  hey I'm Tyler

I have debated at Katy-Taylor High School for four years now and have heavily competed on the national circuit, I did bid to the TOC at Berkeley. For the most part I am a liberal judge, and I do some assistant coaching for Katy-Taylor. This is what I would like to see in a round.

1. You can run whatever you'd like, scream, shout, cuss, kick over a chair, use cx as prep, have a 3nr... I don't care.
(I really don't give a shit anymore, do what you have to do man)
2.Theory = competing interpretations
3. Go as fast as you want but be clear.
4. Critical arguments are fine but honestly, I am not the best guy in the world at evaluating K debates and heavy frameworks, In order to win those in front of me you will need to break it down so I can understand exactly what you are saying. If you can do that I will be very very happy and you will possibly like the outcome at the end of the round.
5. Micropolitical positions/ perfomances are a great thing :)
6. I know debate is hard and I know a lot of the time I as a debater would get super frusturated not breaking at some tournaments by half of a speak, I am very sympathetic on that end so I am probably one to give higher speaks than most other judges to debaters giving it there all... however this is subject to change upon bad debate.
7.If not given a way to view the round, I will default to a comparative worlds paradigm
8. If you have any questions ask away in round.
