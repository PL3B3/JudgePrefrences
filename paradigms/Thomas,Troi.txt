College Debate
Michigan State University (2011)
Towson University (present)

Im a firm believer in not telling debaters what they can and cannot run in front of me. Debate is an activity for students to test their arguments and learn. And I do not believe that right should be taken away due to judge biases.With that being said if you have solid execution, good impact calculus, evidence comparison, and Examples your on you way to getting my ballot. With that being said I will only briefly discuss certain arguments.

Framework

I will vote on Framework despite what you all may believe. However, if you are going against an aff without a plan you must answer the specific impact turns or else it will be hard for me to vote on this argument. In order to go for this argument you must win the reform debate. If you do not, I will lean aff.


Disads

I like disads. I will vote on it. If you skip the case flow. I will lean aff.


Counterplans

I love a good counter plan debate when its specific to the aff and solves large portions of the aff. Im not really a fan of consult or agency cps but if you run it well I will vote on it.


Kritiks

I love kritiks. If you go for the K without specific case arguments. You must apply the k to the specifics of the case. Please do not make it so far out there that it misses the aff. Please also read real links.

however I do not believe white people should run Wilderson. It is a doubleturn. There are other authors You can read on antiblackness. Please do not run this in front of me if you are white. if you are going to do this anyway please do not read the unflynching paradagmatic analysis alt.
