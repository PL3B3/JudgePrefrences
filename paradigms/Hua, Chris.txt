Procedural stuff:
Prep ends when the flash drive leaves the computer
Don't prep afterwards!
I will time because you take too long to pull up your clock app.

TL;DR:
Ask me anything before the roundTell me how to judge and do the impact calc. Kritiks are this activity's saving graceSpreading is fine but have a little pity on me. I like creativity.Be nice, disclose, flash docs promptly.Grabbag: 
I will pay attention There needs to be a winner and a loser. Don't cheat. Be nice.I'm not familiar with specific topicality arguments on this topic.I'm rusty with speed and won't be able to flow at your max speed. I'm (probably) familiar with your kritik, but still explain the argument. Framework is important. The aff should affirm something in the direction of the topic. Go slow on theory. Tech over truth. Weigh your impacts. I do call for cards, but I try to keep this to a minimum. Nobody really knows what 'normal means' is Nobody really knows what 'dispo' is Presumption is in the direction of least change. That isn't always the negative. Royal 10 isn't a terminal impact You should mark your cards The neg should prove the aff plan worse than the SQ or present a competitive option Inclusion is good, offensive 'behavior' can be a voting issueSpeaks:
I try to average 28. I will reward creativity. I will reward clarity. I will appreciate niceness and common courtesy.
