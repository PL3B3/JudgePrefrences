  I debated for about two years in high school. I will vote for any argument,depending on who ever wins the flow. I really like K's and find them to be interesting. Though, if you do run kritiks please explain thoroughly. I love CP's and disads. I really enjoy listening to impact analysis at the end of the debate. The biggest thing to remember while debating is to have fun and to respect each other during the round. I am good with speed as long as you are clear too.
