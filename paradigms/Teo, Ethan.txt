  I debated for Palo Alto High School ('17), competing in both lay and circuit debate. I now attend UC Berkeley.

Most important thing for you to note: do not go over 250 words per minute (I can only handle up to a fast conversational pace). I have a mild genetic hearing disorder (Connexin 26 V-37-I) that makes it extremely difficult for me to flow speed and unclear speech. I will yell "slow" or "clear" up to five times for you in the round, but after that, spread at your own risk.

I also have not been particularly active on the national circuit since 2015 and might not be caught up with any new debate jargon/trends, so if you reference technical terminology in your speech, be sure to explain its implications.

I will vote on any argument that links back to some sort of framework, although the less reasonable it is, the less credence I will give it. As a debater, I was more comfortable with philosophy (that is well-explained) and theory, and less comfortable with critical and policy-style arguments. But don't let that discourage you from reading what you want to read.

Two more things I value greatly:
1. Weigh your arguments! If you don't explain why your arguments are more important than your opponent's, there's no way I can actually evaluate the round without judge intervention, and nobody likes judge intervention.
2. Crystallize! I need to hear why I should vote for you. The end of your final speech should be a clear and simple ballot story.

Speaks:
I will award speaks based on strategy, clarity, and efficiency. I will aim to make my average a 28.5 at any given tournament.

Things that will make me dock points:
1. Being rude or offensive
2. Being too fast or too unclear (after my 5 warnings)
3. Showing up unreasonably late to the round

If you have any questions about my paradigm, ask me before the round. If I had to explain everything I ever thought about debate on this single page, it'd take you far too long to read.
