  I am a second year LD debate coach for Fremd High School. My two years as a judge and debate coach have been exclusively for the local circuit and have not included any experience at the national circuit.

Speed: Do not spread. I would like clear enunciation. Debate is an exercise in communication and speed talking detracts from communication.

Argumentation: I like to see framework debates. I also want to see how your contentions link to your framework and why I should value your framework over your opponent's. I also like when a debater ends with clear voter's issues encapsulating the main issues of clash in the round and why they won those areas of clash.
