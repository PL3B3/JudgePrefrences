  I graduated from Lake Highland Preparatory School in 2016 where I debated for four years qualifying to the TOC my junior and senior year. I am currently a student at New College of Florida studying philosophy. 

UPDATE FOR LHP RR

I've been out of the activity for a little over year now so most if not all of my opinions regarding my preferred style of debate or type of argument are gone. The only things I won't vote for or evaluate are arguments that are blatantly offensive (ex: racism good) or arguments that are utterly unwarranted and the only default I have (which can easily be changed with in round arguments) is that the affirmative's burden is to prove the truth of the resolution and the negative's burden is to prove it's falsity. That being said the only thing I care about is argument quality, so you can run whatever type of argument you want in front of me just so long as you can defend it. In terms of speed as I've said I haven't been involved in the activity for a while so it would benefit you to slow down in front of me (at least at the beginning of your speech). I'll yell slow or clear if I need to. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask me before the round or email me at cordermic@gmail.com
