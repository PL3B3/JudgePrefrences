  I went to Maywood Academy High School in Maywood, CA. I debaterd the first two years that LAMDL was created. After graduating high school I volunteered at LAMDL as a judge. I currently work as the debate coach at Maywood Academy.

I generally don't have a bug spectrum of issues with running any arguments in a debate. K is fine as long as you explain why it matters because otherwise its not worth running, t is only a voter if you prove to me that its not topical, and spreading and tag team are ok with me.
