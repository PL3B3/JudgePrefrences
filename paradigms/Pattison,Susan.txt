  I am a parent of a former LD debater, as well as a current LD debater. Both are from Grapevine.


These are the highlights for my paradigm:


I am a very traditional judge. I am okay with moderate speed.
I do not like theory, I think it is a cheap shot to not debate the resolution. 
I prefer clash, i.e. framework, value/criterion debate. 
Do not be rude to your opponent; even if you won by a landslide, if you were rude, you lose speaker points.
