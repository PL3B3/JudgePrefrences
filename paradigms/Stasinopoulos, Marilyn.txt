  LD Paradigm

GENERAL: My experience with LD debate stems from some regional judging experience, in novice as well as in varsity debate; I am very much a traditional judge, based on the debate I participated in (my school rarely traveled, so this debating was done on a highly regional level and not often) as well as based on rounds I have judged; I strongly prefer quality to quantity in debate rounds, as well as students who value clarity over speed. If you are unclear in a round, or speak too quickly, it will be to your detriment, because I will not be able to flow it.

THEORY: Again, because of my experience, I prefer debaters avoid theory debate; if there is some type of theory violation, I ask that it be clearly articulated and explained, as well as there being some explanation of how it functions in the round. Please do not use theory as a time-suck; chances are you'll use it too quickly for me to catch it, if that is its purpose, but I will also be more doubtful of it if that is its only purpose.

OTHER ARGUMENTS: Aside from that, any type of positions or arguments are acceptable; any type of philosophies or any type of critical theory is fine, but because it is what I am familiar with, I ask students stick to the burden/values/framework/contention structure, to avoid confusion in the round.
