I'll evaluate the round based on whatever framework the debaters provide. Like most judges, I consider specific impact comparison at the end of the round to be essential. I'm comfortable with critical debate, provided that in-round impacts are addressed. I tend to have a slightly high threshold for voting negative on topicality--proving actual abuse is essential. Otherwise, give me a framework with which to evaluate the round, and I'll follow it.
