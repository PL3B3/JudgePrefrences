  Eagan High School '14
New York University â€˜17

Background
I debated for Eagan High School (MN) for four years, graduating in 2014. I debated on both the local and national circuits. During my senior year, I was a semifinalist at the Minnesota State High School League Championship and qualified to the NSDA Nationals. 

Argument Types 
I am open to hearing all arguments, from policy-like arguments to dense philosophical arguments to kritiks. I do prefer that you know your case and arguments well, so that you can clearly explain them to your opponent and myself. I am fine with whatever framework you wish to use. That being said, make sure it is clearly established in your case. Give me clear weighing standards and analysis throughout the debate so that I do not need to intervene. Theory is fine- just make sure you apply it accurately and explain it thoroughly.

General Comments 
Please be respectful to your opponents and myself. I am fine with flex prep if both debaters agree. Be courteous during cross ex and do not talk down to your opponent. Speak clearly. Speaker points will be awarded based on your public speaking skills, evidence quality, and in-round strategy. 


If you have any questions, do not hesitate to email me at rjlowder@gmail.com. Otherwise, please feel free to ask me any questions before the round begins.
