  I debated policy for four years in high school and four years for the University of Kansas. I have coached LD for the last two years.

I have mostly focused on policy-based arguments, and less with LD specific arguments. I am open to all arguments as long as they are clear and well defended.

I am less familiar with how topicality and a priori arguments function with LD rounds, but can be persuaded if argued effectively. I am pro policy-type arguments in LD. I tend to think of myself as an ethical policy maker, but can be persuaded to view my position as something else.

I am very much focused on the flow, but very would like the rebuttals to tell me a big picture of why they win, not just what the other team dropped.

I tend to evaluate LD debates by first determining what value framework I view the rest of the debate through, and then determine whoâ€™s arguments are better within that framework. I tend to evaluate these arguments through an offense/defense paradigm.
