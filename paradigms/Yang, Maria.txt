  Parent Judge. Do NOT spread, run complex philosophy, K's, plans, disads, theory, etc.

In other words, I am extremely lay oriented. I have judged LD for nearly two years, but don't expect me to vote purely off the flow. I believe presentation is important, so unless you crystallize and make it extremely clear WHY what you say is important I will vote off delivery. Weighing is important as well; it should not be my role as the judge to intervene on a coin toss decision. Empirics are good, but make it clear to me why your cards matter and give me YOUR analysis and impacts.
