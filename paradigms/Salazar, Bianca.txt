  There are no "particular" args that I will/won't vote for. I believe every debater has their own style and favorite arguments to run, and I don't think I am anyone to tell you not to run them.
But I won't pick up any team that is blatantly racist, sexist, or says any bad thing like that is good. 
Since I allow you to run whatever argument your heart desires, explain your position, how it works, what it looks like, why it matters, you know... everything every debater should be doing.
I believe there should always be explicit reasons I should vote for a particular team and I think you need to do the work in your speeches to show me that. I don't like debates that are "two ships passing in the night," I want there to be clash. Do your impact cal, and write the ballot for me.
Enjoy what you are doing, don't be a jerk to your partner or the other team or it will affect your speaks. Its okay to be aggressive and passionate, but not all around voracious.
I don't count tech time as prep time, but I also can not stand teams who steal prep (i.e.- you shouldn't be prepping if there is not a clock running) - Just don't do it.
