  Debated at Middle College High School (Memphis, TN)
Policy Debate

Judging for J. Graham Brown School:

LD Paradigm:
1) Speed- Slow down on the tag so we can be on the same page. Speed isnâ€™t an issue just be clear where
I can understand you if I cannot understand you I will let you know.
2) Theory- I love theory arguments just make sure you know what you are talking about. Only thing is try
not to be offensive.
3) Critical Arguments- I am all for it just make sure you properly explain to me and your opposition what
your exactly saying.
Lastly, I am a very laid back judge but most importantly have fun and debate!
