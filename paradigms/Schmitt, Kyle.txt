  My name is Kyle Schmitt. I was a 3-year LD debater for Fremd HS and 2005 IHSA LD Varsity State Champion. I have been judging for about ten years now, almost exclusively LD but some PF.

Speed: I can handle a fair amount of speed, especially when coupled with clear enunciation, but I would prefer a reasonable rate of speech if I had the choice.

The framework debate is important to me. I want to know which V & VC I am looking at to weigh the round.

Give me reasons to believe your claims (you can even call them 'warrants' if you like but don't call it a 'card' unless it's actually on a card).

Tell me why it matters if your claims are true (you can even call them 'impacts' if you like), usually tying directly to the framework(s) in the round.

If you did actually win the round, tell me why with good voting issues. If I agree, I'll just transfer those right over to the ballot.
