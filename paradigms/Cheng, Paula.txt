  I debated for Pace Academy in high school and now for Emory University. 

My predispositions should not change the way you debate and I am willing to listen to anything. I mostly went for CP's and DA's in high school, but have gone for and will listen to anything. I default to tech over truth, but you still need to impact a dropped argument well. I probably call for cards less often than most judges. 

Don't clip cards. Don't cheat. Don't be rude to the other team. 

Topicality – I default to competing interpretations. Make sure you do good impact calculus and explain what the topic looks like under your interpretation. Stupid spec arguments are not a winner.

DA – A good DA/Case debate is awesome and probably my favorite debate to judge.

CP – Advantage CP’s or PICS are awesome. Consult, conditions, process, recommendation, or agent CP’s are probably not competitive and I tend to lean affirmative on theory questions. However, if these CP’s are your thing and you win theory I will definitely vote for it. 

Case – Good case debates are great. I love impact turns as well.

Kritik’s: Specific links. Good explanation. Reading a bunch of generic, pre-typed blocks will not be impressive. 

Theory – Impact calculus on theory is important.Reasons to reject the team and not just the argument need to be clearly articulated.
