  I just finished three years of Coaching debate at Ames High School in Ames, Iowa where I was attending college for math and economics. I spent much of my time prepping my Public Forum students and then Judging LD and Congress. Currently I am in a masters program in New Jersey.

I tend to be fairly open to all types of arguments as long as they are clearly articulated and well warranted.

Speed: If you can do it and annunciate, I can follow it.

Value/Criterion: I feel these are essential to LD. It is even more important to constantly be linking back to the value/crit. However.. See ++

Theory Arguments (a.k.a my opponent is being abusive, arguments): I would rather not vote on such arguments, however that doesn't mean you should stray away from these types of arguments. Just do not rely fully on them. If you feel your opponent is being abusive in her/his observation, definitions, etc., please point this out to me!

Voting Issues: I really like crystallization, so therefore I love voting issues. If you tell me a certain point is the most important, I will believe you. Tell me exactly how and why I should vote.

++In the end, I do not like to think a lot when it comes to filling out a ballot, tell me exactly what is important in the round and I will take your word on it.


If you have any questions, please ask. I'm very willing to talk further about my likes and dislikes.
