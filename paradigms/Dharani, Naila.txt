  I debated for four years on both the local and national circuits for Brentwood School.

Generally, I'm fine with most styles and arguments. Anything specific is mentioned below. I presume affirmative absent arguments to presume neg extended in the round. If I have to do "work," which I promise I'll do my best not to (and usually don't have to), I'll help the affirmative to balance out the neg win skew.

Speed
Fine with speed. I'll yell clear twice before I start docking speaks.

Theory
Fine with theory both as a way to check abuse and as strategy. However, if it's the latter, I am very receptive to 1AR RVIs.

Kritiks/Philosophical Positions
I'm not very well versed in critical or philosophical positions. If you are going to read things that aren't "standard," (examples of standard arguments: practical reason, naturalism, internal motivationism etc.) please go slower and be ready to explain the positions well in CX.

Skepticism/Permissibility
I'm not really a fan of these arguments, so be smart if you run them.

Extensions
I expect to have a full extension (signpost, claim, warrant, impact, implication) or I won't feel comfortable voting on the argument. I have a lower threshold for 1ARs (just a summary, author name, and implication).

Others
Please slow down on author names.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! Good luck! :)
