  Hello, I am a first-year judge, who is very interested in hearing everyone debate! As far as my choice in the round goes, I give my vote to the person who I believe is the most accurate and persuasive in their arguments. Just like all people, of course, I will try as hard as possible to refrain from letting any bias shift my opinion in the round. Whatever is presented will be judged.
Things I Look For:
- Confidence in speaking
- Well developed arguments
- Statistical Evidence wherever needed
- Examples

Things I Do Not Like:
- Speaking very fast (I would like to actually be able to hear your cases!)
- Shuffling papers everywhere
- Getting too aggressive during rounds.

Basically, I want all debaters to do their best! I really am very excited to be presented with new unique arguments. There is no need to be nervous; just be confident, and do your best!
