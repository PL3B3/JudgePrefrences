I am ok with reasonably fast speaking, but you need to speak in such a way that I can understand you. Moreover, you'll need to signpost effectively, and slow down a bit when you are reading tags.

In terms of my case preferences, I am all about setting up frameworks, your explaining why that framework is the best one, and why your arguments impact back to the framework.
