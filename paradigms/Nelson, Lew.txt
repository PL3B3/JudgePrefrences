  I'm one of the few judges you will encounter that is pretty strict about his philosophy. I am a traditionalist, which means that I probably won't vote for you on performance. I'm sometimes okay with kritiks, but I'm not an expert on the philosophy so I won't always know what you're talking about. If you can, try to make it easier for me by not going for a kritik unless it's blantantly obvious that you've won. I prefer a good case debate, but I'm okay with disads and counterplans if they make sense. Be sure to have good links to the case though when you do it.

As far as topicality, I will vote on it if I feel that the case isn't topical and that you've proven it to me. I usually err aff on things like reasonability. For theory debate, my best advice is try to stay away from it. I don't like it, and, unless it's something huge, don't bring it up. I'm sorry that I have to be strict like this, but I've never voted on a theory violation before so I really have to warn you.

I default to a policymaking framework. I don't like speed, so please don't go fast!
