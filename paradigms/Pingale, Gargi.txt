  General: I did LD in high school and know my around PF and IE speeches.
LD: I'm down for spreading as long as you're clear and slow down on the taglines. I like having critical debates (so I'm cool with Ks, DAs, etc.) but please don't make it a policy round. Also, I'm not a fan of theory, but I will flow it if it is needed; so please don't run it unless the round is obviously abusive. I am pretty chill when it comes to speaker points and tend to give high ones, but if you are unclear, obviously abusive, rude, or say anything offensive in any manner (racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc.) you will probably end up with very low speaks and might lowkey end up losing the round, so please try not to say anything that could be taken as offensive. I don't really care about sitting during the round or using a stand, etc, it won't impact the speaks. I'm down for flex prep, as long as both people are cool with it too.

PF: A lot of my LD prefs apply here too. Some things that are different: I love the presentation aspect of PF, so please try to stick to having a professional outlook during the round.
