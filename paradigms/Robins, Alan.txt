  I'm a parent judge; I've judged locally, this tournament (Harvard 2014) being my first national circuit tournament. 

Speed: Don't. I can handle a moderate speed, faster than normal speaking, but if you start spreading in a monotone at me, I won't be able to follow. The more complicated your arguments are, the slower you should go. 

Theory: No frivolous theory, I have a tentative understanding of it. If your opponent is truly being abusive, your best bet is to explain it clearly, and not in the form of a shell. Just explain what the abuse is, and what I should do about it. 

Plans/CPs, K's, etc: I tend to prefer to stick to a traditional case format, (value, standard and contentions). If you're gonna run a strange argument, it's best if it's in this format, it makes it easier for me to understand, and I can evaluate the round the way I'm most comfortable with. I can probably handle more complicated arguments, but break it down for me and make it simple. The more complicated the argument, the more clear you need to be. If I can't understand it, you'll get dropped, regardless of how nice your argument sounds.
