  I debated for four years at Loyola High School of Los Angeles. I can't remember a round I didn't read theory in in either my sophomore or junior year. I also can't remember a round where I didn't read a critical argument in in my senior year. 

I'm cool with spreading but I like slow spreading a lot more. As a general rule, being clear is more important to me than being fast. As a side note, flashing me the case before round would also be much appreciated.

I love good strategy when reading any kind of critical, theoretical, or plan related case. I will evaluate any argument, but, that being said, please explain why my role as a judge matters in relation to what you are reading. If you can explain the logical behind an argument and what it means in terms of the larger debate, I will be much more inclined to vote.

If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask before round. Good luck!
