I have been coaching at BAHS since 1995. In the past we have been active on the TFA, UIL and Urban Debate League circuit.
I would like to consider myself to be a Tabula Rasa Judge - meaning that it is all important to me.

Topicality: running a T argument is fine, just make sure that there is a clear link between the T violation and the Affirmative case. Affirmative can win if you prove that the Negative's violation does not link or your interpretation is better.

Kritik: A Kritik or therory argument is fine - just be sure you know your kritik. Just because you run a K does not mean you will win the round. You must prove your case.

Counterplans: Running a CP is fine. Make sure the Net Benefits are worthy and run your CP from the beginning of the Neg. Do not wait to enter your CP in the 2nd Neg.

Disad: Disads are essential - try not to end in global war or the human race becoming extinct. This is an old argument and we have not faced extinction to my knowledge?:)

Remember above all that you are a Public Speaker and I expect you to be polite to your opponent and to your partner. Speak so that I can hear you and understand what you are saying. I flow debates so if I can't understand what your case is about then I will have nothing on my tablet. I need to emphasize your main points and give my road maps so I know where to flow your arguments. I need you to teach me and preach to me about your case and persuade me as to why I should vote for your side.
Ultimately agree to disagree with one another, learn and have fun in the process.
