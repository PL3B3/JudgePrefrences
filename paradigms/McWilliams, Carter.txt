Conflicts: Ruston High School

My judging philosophy is relatively straight forward. I can appreciate and acclimate myself to speed, however if I can’t follow you it’s your job to be able to read that and work around it. I have an expressive face especially when I’m confused, I don’t like yelling at kids. I prefer to shape the actual direction and nature of the debate rounds I judge as little as possible. I’m not without bias and you should probably strike me if you:
Want to cheat and clip cardsHave a habit of going for neg on presumptionHave something against College BurnoutsWant to rattle off more than 10 off AND convince me that it isn’t absurdOther than that just make sure that if you want me to care about your theory or framework shell you slow down enough for me to keep up and always at least ask yourself what your mom would think and if you could interpret your position to her. Bonus points for wit no matter where it is directed and if you can make impact calc relative to anime I enjoy you’ll really be getting somewhere. Have fun but understand your limitations and strengths as speakers.
