  I am a Debate Coach at William T Dwyer High School in Palm Beach Florida. I am a traditional lay judge. Most importantly I require clarity, if I can't hear and understand your argument or what you are saying then it won't be counted. If you spread you will get lower speaker points and I will likely drop you in the round. Don't bring up new arguments in rebuttals, I will do my best to notice these, and if it is a completely new argument it won't be counted. Don't use progressive policy style tactics like counter-plans or kritiks, if you want to use those do policy debate, not LD. Argue the resolution as its stated and be fair and respectful to your opponent.
