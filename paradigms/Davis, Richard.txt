  Run what you're good at, run what you like, and run what you and your partner think is the best to win.
Speed: I'm fine with speed. Just be clear. If you're going too fast, I'll say speed. I'll only say it three times.
CPs: I'm fine with any type of counter plan. Just explain why I should prefer it over the aff.
Theory: I'm more likely to vote arguments down, not the team. If you want me to vote a team down on theory, you're going to have to do a lot of work on impacting your voters and explaining the abuse/potential abuse story line (same for T).
K: Run your thing. I like specific link analysis to the aff that articulate how the impact happens. Explain to me how the alternative works and what my role is in relation to the alternative.
T: I'll vote for it but make sure you show me the abuse and potential abuse and impact it for me.
Overall: At the end of the round, tell me what to vote for and why.
Keep your own time.
Recently I find myself voting more on structural violence than big scale impacts
