  I'm a paleo-LD debater who competed in the 80's, but these days mostly I judge Congress, speech, and PF. I'm largely indifferent to the policy-debatification of LD since that time, but I'd probably hate that trend if LD were my coaching responsibility.

I can handle faster-than-conversation speed, but much faster than that and I miss things. Some grad school classes help me understand po-mo arguments, but postmodernism (especially as it is deployed in debate) is not my native language, so it's best to explain everything and not launch into the kind of short-hand you could use for an actual circuit judge.

When I go to a tournament where I'll be judging LD, I try to read a few general-interest things about the topic so I'll know about the issues.

Maybe it will help to say that I was comfortable judging LD elim rounds at CFL Nats two years ago, but I probably wouldn't feel confident enough to judge LD at TOCs.
