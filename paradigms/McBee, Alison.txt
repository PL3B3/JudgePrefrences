  I prefer a traditional approach to LD. I understand Kritiks, disads, and counterplans to an extent, but am of the philosophy that if you want to do policy debate, do policy debate. I like hearing value and criterion clash. If you want me to buy your arguments, make sure that they are reflective of your framework- I shouldn't have to work hard to follow you and figure out why you are right.

I absolutely WILL NOT flow spreading- in my mind, debate has as much to do with a speaker's articulate and eloquent presentation as it does with creatively crafting, supporting, and defending arguments. My judging background is primarily PF, Parli, and Speech events.
