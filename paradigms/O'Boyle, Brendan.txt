1. The most important thing you can do is genuinely engage your opponent's arguments and develop a clear clash as the round progresses. I like to
see both a very careful consideration of all points on the flow as well as a larger explanation of how those points are playing out in the round.

2. Whether you're speaking at normal conversational speed or more quickly, make sure that you are very clear. That being said, I think there's some limit to how fast is reasonable.

3. I tend not to like really strange arguments that don't relate directly to the resolution because from what I have seen they either: a. Stem from honest intentions but wind up
sidetracking or muddling the debate; or b. Are used with the strategic intention of tripping up the opponent without adding any real value to the debate. However, I'm pretty
reasonable and am open to listening to off-beat arguments. Just make sure that you sincerely feel they're justified and explain that to me.

4. Rounds are easiest to evaluate when you're linking back to either a given value structure or burden. Regardless of what mechanism you use, definitely adopt a very clear
method of weighing the round and justify it if it's different from your opponent's. I will still evaluate and consider arguments and observations brought up that may not directly link back to the value structure or burden.

There's not too much to say other than that. Just do your best to be clear and logical. Always deal directly with the substance of your own and your opponent's arguments.

Good luck!
