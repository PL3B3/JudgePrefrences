  Overview: I've been involved in high school debate in one way or another for the last 10 years (debating, judging). I'm pretty much tab. I decide debates based on the best argumentation. I don't have a preference regarding kritiks, stock issues, theory, etc.. I will vote for the team with the most compelling arguments, period.

More specifically: For me, it's about the story. It's crucial that disadvantages, kritiks, CPs, cases, etc. have a coherent narrative. What I mean by this is that every argument should have a story (If case happens then Anwar happens then animals die then everyone is sad). I expect this story to be extended throughout the debate round in a meaningful way. Extending cards without extending the warrants in the cards, and WHY the cards are important in the debate round is silly. This story stuff goes for theory arguments as well, I want to hear an abuse story, a fairness story, an education story, whatever.

On the theory debate: I won't flow blippy arguments. Having 89 theory points on your PICs bad block does not win you the argument. I would prefer 5 well articulated theory arguments. Let me know which theory arguments are the important ones, I don't want to drown in a sea of theory mediocrity.

I have no preferences about speed, though clarity is important. That is to say, I would like it if the debaters were saying words. If the debater ever feels like she is going so fast that she is no longer saying words, she should slow down. This shouldn't have to be mentioned.
