  My name is Greg Foster. I competed for Wellington High School in PF for three years and now compete in Policy at Florida State University. 

I consider myself to be much more of a lay judge, however I am fine with speed. If you choose to spread, flash me or speech doc/email gregoryfosterh@gmail.com. 

I evaluate the round almost entirely on the flow. I prefer standard policy arguments with inherency, advantages, DAs, CPs, solvency, etc. However, I will evaluate Ks or kritikal affirmatives, role of the ballot, whatever. Be aware, I am not the most versed with kritikal literature. Feel free to use theory. I’m a fan of topicality and severance theory. For other theory, make very clear the violation that has occurred. When evaluating impacts, I dislike extinction impacts read every year. Probable, realistic impacts, such as effects from Trump’s stupidity, always outweigh impossible extinction scenarios. 

Ultimately, do whatever is most comfortable to you. I will try to accompany you as best possible. There are few things that would cause me to vote you down outright.

I award speaker points more on persuasion and argumentation than technical ability. I won’t give great speaks to someone who spreads every second of every speech. Put down the cards and talk to me.
