        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        LD: Value, theory, standard, non-policy, Critique's, Stories.

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        speak FLUENTLY

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        cannot speak fluently and enunciate. 

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        logical fallacies 

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        STOCK ISSUES FOR LD.

    
    
        Rate the following argument types

        Topicality: Okay
Theory: Awesome
Counterplans: Okay
Disads: Awesome
Kritiks: Awesome
Framework: Awesome
Speed/Spreading: Don't care

    
    
        Explain your ratings, if you like

        More of a traditional LD background, focusing on the logical flow and persuasive ability of the debater over quantity of arguments. 

    
    
        Comments on flowing or speed:

        doesn't matter, fluency does.

    
    
        Other things a team should know about?

        I did LD, I coach LD, I have competed at NFL Nationals, UIL State, TFA State and Bid at TOC for LD. I know what to expect from all circuits nationally. I also did a bunch of other events where I was also competitive, so I bring a sense of professionalism to the round.
