KASA/Baltimore Urban Debate League
I am a high school social studies teacher and a first year debate coach.
I have judged debates on the transportation topic in Baltimore and at regional tournaments.
I like to see strong, clear, passionate clash.
You don’t want to use a lot of jargon or focus too much on debate theory, and you want to watch out with speed: keep an eye on me when I am flowing. If you are going too fast, I will offer a warning. If you ignore it, don’t expect me to catch what you say. I will not
My teams run performance/critical race related arguments, so I am most familiar with that world of argument, but am open to whatever arguments you want to run!
I believe debate is about passion and love for what you are arguing, so my heart is with the K and with personal narratives; however, I have an open mind toward all valid arguments.
