  I am a parent judge and I haven’t judged before. However, I have watched many public forum rounds and some LD rounds.

General stuff:
Try not to use too much jargon--if you are using jargon make sure you explain it in lay-man’s terms.I don’t have much experience flowing, so don’t go fast. If you plan on spreading you should probably strike me.I am unfamiliar with pretty much all types of arguments. Whatever you are running make sure you explain it clearly and have a clear impact. If I don’t understand the argument (and I probably won’t the first time) I can’t vote on it.I like very clear real-world impacts and logical, easy-to-grasp arguments. Make the impacts very clear and have good impact analysis.With all of your arguments tell me why you win them and why they matter. Please do a lot of weighing. If neither debater makes it clear that they’re winning, I’ll probably end up intervening somehow and make both debaters unhappy.
If you have any other questions feel free to ask me before the round. As a general rule, try to make things as clear as possible to me and you should be fine.
