  I'M VERY LAY! MY SON WROTE THIS FOR ME! PLEASE DON'T SPREAD!

NOTE: If you wanâ€™t me to accurately judge your spread you MUST provide a copy of your case prior to the affirmative constructive or negative constructive for me to look at (for reasons of possible lack of articulation, clarification of a card, etc). Unfortunately if I am not given a copy of your spread (for ONLY the duration of the affirmative constructive, or negative constructive) I may not be able to judge your speech to the best of my ability. Please slow down A LOT on tag lines of cards, contentions, etc.

I'm kind of familiar with Lincoln Douglas jargon, but not too much. Instead of using jargon I would appreciate it if you explained what the jargon you are utilizing means that way I can try to understand it. I can judge super simplistic counter-plans, and basic theory however I prefer traditional cases. Make sure when debating a counter-plan you explicitly state why your alternative is better than voting on the resolution. Please be ready to show any cards or philosophy in your case on the spot after the second affirmative rebuttal to ensure a proper decision. I am uncomfortable with kritiks however I can judge theory shells. As a warning however I will NOT vote on theory if your shell's interpretation is bogus and the opposing debater refuses to respond. This being said if I find the shell's usage is appropriate by all means I will vote on theory if it is not competed with. I am also open to flex-preparation and will time all portions of the debate.
