  I am a parent judge. I have judged slow policy debate for one year. I am used to the stock issue for of debate used in the CFL state tournament. I cannot understand spreading, so you must speak at a usual pace for me to understand your arguments. I am not experienced with what they call off-case positions. Essentially, I am much more equipped to be a stock issue slow policy judge.
