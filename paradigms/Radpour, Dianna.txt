  I did LD debate at Anderson High school for 3 years and graduated in 2013.

Run anything that your heart desires; I think debate should be a forum for you to express your ideas freely and openly, and I don't think it's the judge's role to tell you via what style or type of argumentation you should do that through. That being said, I do enjoy hearing good Ks or disads, and I am not a fan of theory being run just for the sake of running theory. I do ask that anything you run, you understand (or at least make it appear like you do so) well. Anything is free game in terms of how I'll vote, as long as you make me feel compelled to vote for your position at the end of the round. Please do your best to limit the need for any kind of intervention. Please be polite and respectful at all times in your round. There is a difference between tastefully sassy and rude, and your speaker points will reflect that if I felt you were being disrespectful. Bonus points for super creative and unique positions, not for abusive ones that were clearly intended to just win rounds and not promote meaningful thought or debate. Speed is okay, but slurring should not be synonymous with spreading. You will most likely be able to tell by my non-verbals if you're doing something that I find to be atrocious (i.e. my face, or if I put my pen down).

If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask.
