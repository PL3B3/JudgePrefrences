pls have clash, line by line, and idk arguments with warrants and claims and impacts
don't say sexist/racist/ or otherwise generally offensive things
topicality: explain so it is not a wash, its ok, but like, please tell me why its /actually important
framework: impacts! explain impacts!
CP: not a fan of delay cp, but will still vote on it if you convince me. PICS are great if smartly executed and well explained
DA: link chain, specifics, impact analysis
K: you do you, but please understand what you're saying otherwise I will not pretend that I do...so like, clarity and avoid long overviews
K aff- sure
ill evaluate anything probably, but i prefer evaluating structural arguements, so i get sad when they're brought up but covered/become a wash
