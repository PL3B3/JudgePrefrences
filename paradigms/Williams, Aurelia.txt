I will vote for the argument that won. Argumentation is more important to me than tech. I am fine with speed as long as your tags and citations are very clear. Clarity takes priority over speed for me. I am a varsity debater in college so I will know most authors you are reading very well- that being said, you should too. Ethos is very important to me, and I will give high speaker points to those who really command their arguments. I do not like low point wins but I will grant them. Racism, sexism, misogyny, etc; in round will not be tolerated.
