  Speed- Medium to medium-fast (only really an issue if it gets in the way of speaking style, I don't like fast for the sake of fast).

Criterion- May be a voting factor depending on its use in the round, but not always.

Voting issues- fine to use, but I'll only vote on them if I agree debater won the argument.

Speaking style/evidence/argumentation- all important!!
