I debated for four years at Baltimore City College where I qualified to the TOC 3 times and also won the NCFL and NAUDL championships my senior year. 
Throughout high school, I mostly read critical arguments and senior year I exclusively read critical positions that mainly centered on the question of white supremacy and inherent racial practices present within the political spectrum.

Preference- I prefer judging critical debates over “traditional” debates because I find them more interesting and educational, however my background should not deter you from running traditional arguments. If you are a policy team, and don’t like going for the K, then don’t. I find it very annoying when debaters “over” adapt to the judges by going for an argument they are not totally comfortable with just because of the judge’s background. 

Evidence- debaters need to stop relying on evidence so much- I’d rather have a 2NC spend 4 minutes explaining their argument instead of reading 15 cards that don’t explain the argument for me. Debate is a persuasive activity so in the 2nr convince me that the states cp can solve for aff with actual reasons instead of saying our “x” evidence says so- over reliance on evidence will result in low speaker points

Please be nice
Thanks
