  I debated for Battle Ground Academy in Tennessee for four years and have taught at the Philadelphia Debate Institute (PDI).
I vote primarily off the standards -- the debater who impacts his/her arguments to the standard will win. Ideally, both debaters should attempt to resolve the standards debate as soon as possible in order to develop more clash in the round. Each debater must provide voting issues which clarify the main areas of clash in the round. I do not like theory. I find that in most circumstances, it is not necessary. In terms of speed, I don't appreciate it when arguments become incomprehensible due to excessive speed.
