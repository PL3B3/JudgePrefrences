This year ('11-'12) is my first year with debate (I'm an English teacher). To that end, please remember the following:


DON'T SPREAD! If I can't flow you, you will lose. If I can't understand you, you will get low speaker points.Please give me a road map before your speech, and signpost really well as you go.Pretend you are modeling a debate for a novice - explain acronyms, avoid overuse of jargon and abbreviations, simplify complex concepts.I'm looking to see that you understand what you're talking about, not just reading off of a card. I tend to judge heavily on cross-x, and how well you can explain/clarify your position.

I'm ok with shadowing and tag-teaming, as long as both teams agree. 

Don't be mean during cross-x, it shows a lack of confidence in your argument. If your opponent's argument is weak, and your argument is strong, you shouldn't need to use sarcasm or insults to show it. Rudeness will result in lower speaker points. 

I'm weak on things like T and K - don't be afraid to use them, but make sure to make it very understandable. 

I place much more emphasis on your arguments than on your cards. I am evaluating you on your ability to use the evidence to support your argument, not on your ability to plunk a bunch of research down in front of me.

Bear with me, I'm still learning. However, don't blow my evaluations off as those of an inexperienced judge - there are going to be some judges of my experience level or less in most of the tournaments you go to. I pinky swear to be honest in my comments, and as extensive and specific as my experience allows. Feel free to ask me as many questions as you like after the ballot's been turned in. 

Most importantly, relax and have fun.
