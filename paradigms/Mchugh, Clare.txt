  I'm Clare McHugh a judge for Hunter College High School. I have judged at numerous varsity tournaments including Harvard, Big Bronx, and Yale.As an experienced parent judge I walk into a debate round waiting to be convinced by clear and sensible argumentation. Although I won't disregard a theoretical or highly technical argument on principle, I will need these to have rational merit. Be forewarned if I can't follow it, I'm not going to vote for it, even if it sounds clever. I'll tolerate speed, but again if I lose track of what points you're attempting to make I can't vote off them. I appreciate good mannersâ€”all those little things like standing during cross-ex, shaking hands, and listening to one's opponent without sighing audibly or rolling one's eyes. I will disclose when I feel the round is easily decided, but I often take the time to ponder my decision after you leave the room. As this is for your benefit I appreciate your quick departure and gracious acceptance of my ultimate decision. I award good speaker points to debaters whose rhetoric and logic really impress me. Although I have only awarded about half a dozen of 30's in my two-year career, I have often given out 29's to speakers who bring eloquence and thoughtfulness to their speeches. Good luck and have fun!!
