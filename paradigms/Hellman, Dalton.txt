  I look forward to judging rounds for everyone. Below is some of my judging philosophy. As always, feel free to ask specific questions in round if you have them. Background: 4 years competing in speech and debate in high school (Canby) 4 years competing in college (Mt. Hood CC and Boise State Univ.) Debated almost every format and will judge any format of debate. How I view rounds: The start of the round is your space. Use it how you want to. I have clean pieces of paper in front of me at the start of the round and that is how I judge. If you tell me something, it is on my paper. I will evaluate a round how you tell me to. I believe the debate space is yours to use how you want. I will listen to almost any argument and would consider myself pretty progressive for debate. I am alright with you running: Kritiks Plans Counter Plans Theory I am fine with speed. I feel like I keep up with almost anyone. If you are going fast and aren't clear then I will either stop writing or say clear. In the end, I want to see a good round with clash and lots or arguments. I evaluate theory first and foremost unless you tell me otherwise and then go to offensive arguments before defensive. As I said, if you have specific questions feel free to ask me. Thanks!
