  Gil Gutierrez - Attorney at Law. I am a volunteer parent of a Policy Debater. I have a B.A. in English from U.C. Davis in 1975 and a J.D. from MLK School of Law at U.C. Davis in 1978. I practiced personal injury law in the Bay Area from 1979-1982 and local government law in Stockton, CA from 1982 to the present. I have approximately 30 jury trials and numerous court and administrative cases. I have orally argued before state and federal court of appeals.
 
I believe that oral advocacy requires a committment from the advocate to portray his/her belief in the position or view being espoused. In my opinion, an advocate portrays this belief by oral organization, voice tone, eye contact, smiles, posture and hand movements which display confidence in the position. I like advocates to display knowledge of the subject by describing the issue, rule, facts, analysis and conclusion. I like a reasonable, logical argument which sets forth the issue(s) and, after analysis, resolves them. While I like to be entertained by the oral advocates, I do not appreciate personal attacks, snide remarks ior insignificant battering between them. I am very impressed by the high quality of advocates/debaters in my first year judging. Good Luck!
