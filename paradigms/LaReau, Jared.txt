  BACKGROUND:

I debated at Rogers Heritage High School. My partner and I won the Arkansas Tournament of Champions. I also received top speaker. I taught at the Natural State Debate institute with a focus on Heidegger, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, and Kritik theory. I have coached individual teams for many years and I have been judging policy since 2012. I graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a Bachelors of Arts in Digital Filmmaking and Political Science.

Debate philosophy
 I am a tab judge. Speed is more than fine with me, but I do ask that you clear up your tags. If you extend a card but I can't find the tag that you are referring to, I can't help you. Give a clear road map before each speech.

As a tab judge, I have no inherent like or dislike of an argument. Kritiks, framework, and theory debates are more than fine with me. I prefer cross ex to be closed, but if both teams agree to open then that is what the round will be. I expect that both teams time each other during prep. You can time yourself during your speech. 

Speaks
 
Be clear on your tags and signpost well. I do not care if you sit or stand. Speaks can save you in a tournament. Every debater should be well organized with their time allocation, clearly analyzing the round, and focusing on delivery. All of these factors play into your speaks. So follow them and good luck.
