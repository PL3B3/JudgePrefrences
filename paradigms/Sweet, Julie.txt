  Debate is an educational activity. Its value is in developing critical thinking skills and the capacity to persuade audiences, as well as exposing its participants to new ideas. To that end, participants should respect one another (bullying your opponents or your partner is a red flag you don’t have confidence in the quality of your arguments or your skills as a debater), speech should be comprehensible (this applies to your rate of speech as much as articulating your ideas), and thoughtful ideas will carry more weight than rote arguments.

That being said, I do my best to evaluate the arguments as they are made. I won’t do a lot of work for you but I also do my best not to prejudge an argument. I’m a fan of language and of the activity so I enjoy a good debate on topicality, critical theory, and the rules of the game more broadly.

I've debated, coached, and judged high school and college policy. If you make the debate interesting, enjoyable, and challenging and explain to me why I should vote for you, odds are pretty good that I will.
