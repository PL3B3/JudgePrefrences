  I debated two years and currently judge and assist coaching under Houston County High School. 
I've judged most Georgia tournaments including the Barkley Forum.
Though personally I do not like the K, I am open to the K debate as long as the debate is fleshed out and developed on all parts focusing heavilly
on the alt debate because this is where I find myself voting.
I generally have a high threshold on theory debates. Clear, in-round abuse must be proven or a substantial impact on debate through potential
abuse must be proven.
All else is fine and should be left to the debaters to orchestrate in rounds.
Personal prefs: I keep a rolling clock, and for paperless teams (which is mostly everyone), prep time ends when the flashdrive leaves the computer. 
I try to stay away from calling for evidence unless the debate is unclear or underdeveloped where the central focus is. All other indicts must be 
called by the debater in round (i.e inditing and author, validity of clarification of an argument or evidence (like with K evidence), clipping cards, 
speeches incorrectly flashed, etc.)
