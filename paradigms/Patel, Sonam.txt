  I competed in LD for 4 years in high school. I prefer a values debate and clarity is important. 

I will accept all arguments that are relevant to the resolution and clearly explained. However, don't assume that I will understand all debate specific jargon. 

Make sure to extend arguments. Weigh arguments by relating back to the values debate and crystallize.

Avoid excessive speed - if I don't catch it, it won't count.
