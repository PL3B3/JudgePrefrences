Coach, college and high school debate background.

I make a very concerted effort to be open minded when considering your arguments. Run whatever you want. Wanna run a traditional fiat strat? Word. Wanna shit on some paper and read a poem? I’m down. But please don’t fiat/shit just for the sake of it. Make an argument. Defend a framework. Make some offense/defense comparisons for me. Simplify the round. That being said, please feel free to ask me any specific questions you may have before the round.
