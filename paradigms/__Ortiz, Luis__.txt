Varsity Debate Coach at Elizabeth Learning Center

For me debate needs to be fun and exciting. I like the speed of policy but if you spread you need to be clear and slow on the tags. I really enjoy analytics in a debate because it shows you know your AFF and how current events affect it.

-AFF:
The aff must show me how well you now your aff, how it works, its necessity, and how it solves for your harms. You need to paint me the picture not let me figure it out. You have to win every single part of your aff in order form to vote for you.

- K Aff:
Make sure you have a clear framework and objective and again you need to show me how well you now your aff, how it works, its necessity, and how it solves for your harms.
You have to win every single part of your aff in order form to vote for you. This is a type of debate I am not really familiar with so you are going to have to be VERY clear and understandable.

- Topicality:
I only vote on T if their is a clear abuse from the AFF and if the neg shows me that the AFF is super abusive. The neg must make sure they show me the real abuse and how it affects the arguments and their education during the round.

- Kritick:
As far as the kritik goes I enjoy hearing the arguments but the alternative usually falls short. The only possible thing I can see an alt solving for is some kind of in round impact. Make sure that you do impact calculus so that I can know whether to prefer the impacts of the aff or the K first. Also make sure that the Alternative and Links are explained throughout the debate round, this makes the round flow smoother.
- CPs:
Make sure the CP Topical on the topic and you have clear solvency. Witch means do your research on the party or group doing the action. Mush show how it out weights and solves better than the AFF plan. Yu must have a clear answer to any perm and show me how it does not work with your plan.

- DAs:
You must show me a real link or a direct link to the AFF not any Generic links. Its okay okay to run generic links in your 1AC but make sure you solid links and don't hope a generic link gets through the round. Also make sure you impact the DA and have a solid impact. Again you need to paint me the picture don't expect me to put everything together. You also need to make sure you explain the net benefit to either the CP or K.
