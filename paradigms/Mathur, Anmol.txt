  Bellarmine College Preparatory parent judge.

I am a completely lay judge for your purposes. I have only a few rounds of prior experience on this topic, so it is advantageous to you to explain what's going on.
I will judge by the stock issues paradigm. In other words, the affirmative needs to defend Harms (a problem exists now), Inherency (there is no current solution in the status quo), Solvency (the plan solves the problem), DAs (the plan has no disadvantages big enough to outweigh its advantages), and Topicality (the plan falls reasonably within the bounds of the resolution). If the negative wins any of these, they win the debate.

If I am judging your round, please go slow. If you go fast and the other team does not, it does not matter to me whether you are better - I will vote against you. If both teams go fast, the decision will be a coin flip, and speaks will be very low.

Thanks and good luck.
