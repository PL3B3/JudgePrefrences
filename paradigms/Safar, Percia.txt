  I debated for Monte Vista and graduated in 2009. I competed on the national circuit and at state/nationals. 

I a have no bias against speed, but clarity is important. If I cannot understand you, there is little chance I will be able to vote on your arguments. Given that I have not judged in a while, I would err on the side of caution.

You can run whatever types of arguments you want, but explain how it operates in the round so I know how to vote. 

Ultimately, I prefer clear and substantive rounds. Be smart and have fun!
