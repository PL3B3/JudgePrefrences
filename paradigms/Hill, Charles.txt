  Background: debated LD and a bit of PF at The Woodlands. Gained a bulk of my debate knowledge from UTNIF. Now I'm just an argumentative college student at UT Austin (Finance and Plan II majors). Feel free to ask me questions about UT after the round!

Here's what's up:

You know that one case you have that you wrote with your friends for the hell of it, the one that is absolutely ridiculous and should never actually be used in a debate round? Run that case. Reasonability is going out the window â€“ spice things up a bit. My favorite round I ever debated was when I ran Martyr Theory at Harvard '14 (essentially you tell the judge to down your opponent so that he/she complains to others about it and sparks up conversation about the resolution). Make this round interesting! Shenanigan cases are welcome here.

Ks/theory/fw/plans etc-
I'm not a pro but I'm fine with it; I ran a bunch of Ks. If you get really trippy then I'm not going to understand it so watch out for that because I'm not going to vote for something I don't understand. For theory it'll be a question of competing interps.

Speed-
If it looks/sounds like you're choking on a carrot while you're debating then you're doing it wrong. I'm fine with speed as long as you are saying words, not gasping out syllables. If that's not clear then just ask me about it before the round and I can clarify.

Misc-
-trigger warnings are important if you're going to run something that might need one. I'm totally fine with you running it and won't censor the debate, but it's just respectful.
-high speaks for Kanye references
-I'm not going to drop you for reading extinction/oppression/terrorism is good etc. but I hope you don't believe it in person
-If you're clearly more experienced than you opponent, don't make it a bloodbath. It's awkward when someone starts crying in-round and it just hurts the spirit of debate

Let me know before round if you have any other questions.
