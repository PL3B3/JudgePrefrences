I consider myself open to anything. I personally don't like to hear a debate about topicality but that doesn't mean I won't vote for it, I do have a high threshold for topicality though so choose your battles. Theory is fine but if you intend on winning the round on theory you have to prove that it has significantly hurt your ability to debate or learn in the round, don't just whine. I generally listen to everything and unless told otherwise will view a k on the same level as politics. It is your responsibility to tell me how i should look at the round and what is apriori. I understand the k fairly well, i ran several in high school, but you need to explain it and it's importance, don't assume I know the argument by name. I listen fast but if you are unclear I will yell 'clear' twice, after that I won't flow what I don't understand. I won't look at cards after the round unless they are contested in round because frankly I'm too lazy to. If the opposing team doesn't contest it they concede it as true. I will only half listen to cross-x so if something is said during cross-x that you want me to take note of then make sure I know. I have no problem with alternative forms of debate but speaker times will not be changed in front of me. Most of all run what you feel comfortable running and it will probably go smoothly in front of me.
