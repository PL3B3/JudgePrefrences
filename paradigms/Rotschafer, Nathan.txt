  Hi, my name is Nathan Rotschafer, my pronouns are he/him/his and I don't go by Nate. 

I debated on that national circuit for Millard West and then coached Omaha Bryan a few years back. I've been away from the activity for 12 years.

You can think of me as a traditional judge, but a few things:

Argument Style: I don't outwardly reject any argument from a competitive standpoint, ex. a kritik or a counterplan, though I am not too familiar with them.

I won't flow blips/spikes without warrants and impacts fully fleshed out. 

I'm more comfortable with philosophical arguments/frameworks, and I minored in philosophy in college. 

I find definitional debates silly unless it is critical to your position.

You should tell my how to vote and where through both your crystallization and weighing. This is super important! What I think is important for you to win may not match what you think is important for you to win, so clearly articulate what you need to do win the round and how you meet that.
