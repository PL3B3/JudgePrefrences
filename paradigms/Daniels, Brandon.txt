  I ain't about to lie to you and say that I love watching a good traditional policy round. 

I debate at UT, and before that I was at UTSA. I feel it is fair to warn you that I don't read a plan text for my personal debate rounds. I would love to tell you that I am a "tabula-rasa" judge (whatever that means,) but I am not. I very much clearly ENJOY watching a round that contains critical elements versus a policy debate round. In fact, I think the best way for me to explain how I evaluate rounds is to list my favorite genres of debate.

These are the debates that I enjoy watching. DO NOT READ THAT AS: don't run these arguments in front of me. I feel like it should probably go without mention that I will try my best to evaluate the debate regardless of my ideological disposition. At least I am being open about being an ideologue right?!?

Here is some free coaching: it is probably a bad idea to before the round starts plan on going for theory. You will have to do a lot of work in order to win a theory debate in front of me. 

I will shit on your speaker points if I think you create a hostile learning environment.
