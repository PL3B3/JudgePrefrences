Debate for San Francisco State University (JV Division) 

I will vote for anything. Effective debate is explained in debate. I am not voting for a one-liner or a blippy argument just because it was dropped. I would rather a team privilege clarity over speed. Use your brains; the cards don't explain themselves. You need to explain the value and application of your evidence. I am unlikely to read evidence at the end of the debate so you need to persuade me by discussing the content of the evidence. 

Topicality - Cool with me. Make the violation clear. Explain the Standards and Voting Issues. 
Case Debate, Disadvantages, Kritik's, & Counterplan - I am a fan of clash. Don't avoid the aff when you are neg.
