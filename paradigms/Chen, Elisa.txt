Guidelines 
• As long as you are speaking clearly, flowing will not be an issue. That being said, speaking extremely fast does not impress me.
• Do not drop arguments. 
• Incorporating warrants and adequately explaining their impact on the resolution is important; value clash is the most important.
• Cross examination questions should not be wasted. Where possible, please reference back to CX during your later speeches. 
• In rebuttals, please clearly delineate the voting issues of the round and why your side is superior.
• Be resolute, but also polite!
