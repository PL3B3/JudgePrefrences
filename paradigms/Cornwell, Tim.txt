  I have been active in Forensics since 1993. I have judged PF at 4 Nationals(NFL and TOC) plus many, many regional and national tournaments.

PF Debate:

Since it is public forum, speaking clearly and using language suitable for the "public" is very necessary. This is not Policy Jr!

Solve!!!

Better bring that evidence to the round, abstracts and incomplete articles won't carry any weight with me.

I will bring my Tabula Raza so don't make me intervene. IMPACT!!! (I will buy anything as long as it is logical and supported by evidence) If I am forced to intervene because of zero impacts in round, I am left of center economically, as far left socially as one can be except on death penalty(when not used as a tool to eliminate minorities), and center-right on gun control.

Crystallize your winning arguments and give me offense. 

Rude, belligerent debaters will be penalized.
