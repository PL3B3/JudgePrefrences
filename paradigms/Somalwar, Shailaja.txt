  Hello,

I don't have much experience with judging debate. Please speak at a conversational speed and explain your arguments clearly. I will be looking for clarity and crystallization. Make links in your speeches--I will vote off what is said in the debate, not what I must infer. Not a fan of kritiks and theory arguments--keep arguments straightforward.

Thanks!
