  I was a local/regional/national circuit debater in both LD and PF for 3 years for Timothy Christian School, but I will mainly judge PF because I spent my senior year debating solely PF. I now am an assistant coach for the team that I debated for throughout high school. I have judged multiple rounds this year for every resolution, meaning I have an idea of what is going on in rounds.
Some things that are necessary for you to win the round:
1. Extensions. If you want me to look at an argument in your final focus, it is essential that you extend it during your summary.
2. Outweigh. Give me a reason as to why your 25% is more important than your opponent's $200,000. Tell me how the people you are affecting are more important than your opponent's. Essentially, do not make me assume anything and do not make me pick which is more important.
3. Write the ballot for me. Give me clear voters during the round. Literally, tell me what to write on my ballot. Again, do not make me pick which is more important. Tell me why your side is more important.
I will vote off of the flow, so make sure to signpost. I will only intervene on the account that there are no voting issues during the round and no real arguments standing, that being said be clear and very selective.
Regarding speaks, make sure you are respectful, or I will not hesitate to lower your speak points.
Overall, debate is about having fun and gaining knowledge, so make sure you that every round is focused around this.
