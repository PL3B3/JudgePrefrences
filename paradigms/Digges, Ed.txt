  I am the coach/parent for the Heights' Debate team and have been judging for a few years on the local and national level. 
I am traditional. Presentation and sign posting are very important. Strike me if you feel the need to go above 250 wpm, run a K, or multiple T shells. That being said though I am fine with more policy-like arguments such as DA's or CP's as long as the links are clearly demonstrated and the tags are clear. If I don't understand you, you didn't say it.
Let me repeat: If I didn't understand you, you didn't say it!
--> It is also very important that you sign post on your opponent's case, I want you to summarize what you are going to say and where on the flow you are going to say it before you say it.
If you want to win a round with me the most important part is crystallization. Just a summary at the end of your speech saying what you arguments are, why they stand, and why you win is enough for me.
Args I like: 
Util, and generally logical arguments 
Args I don' like:
Social contract f/w, most Deont, meta-ethics, K, performance cases and the like
