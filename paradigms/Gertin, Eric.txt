  I am judging LD from McQuaid Jesuit in Rochester, NY. My background includes engineering and teaching science, so I would like to hear evidence in an argument, although if an opponent does not specifically challenge, neither will I. 

Speaking should be done in a clear manner - I find slower speech is usually more clear. It will also be concise. If speech is rapid, I will lose the thread of the argument. If you must rush to complete your argument in the allotted time, perhaps some editing is in order.

I will look for competitors to link their contentions to the value and criterion. The rebuttals should address the opponent's in a similar manner. 

Respect and professionalism should be adhered to at all times. This would be reflected in speaker points and probably win/loss.
