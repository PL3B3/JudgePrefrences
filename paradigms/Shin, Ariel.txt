  I debated for four years for Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, CA. I went to TOC my senior year. 

Theory/T: Fine with me. I think theory/T is a great strategic tool but if you run it just to mess with your opponent and the round goes terribly I won't be very happy. I default to competing interps, drop the argument, and no RVI's absent those arguments being made. 
PLEASE BE SUPER DUPER CLEAR ABOUT HOW YOU WANT ME TO EVALUATE THINGS. SPEND TIME WEIGHING AND SAYING EXACTLY HOW I VOTE. 
Kritiks: Also fine with kritiks. If its really complex, make sure you explain it. If I don't understand it, I won't vote off of it. 

Policy Args: Also fine with me. Do a lot of impressive weighing, and get higher speaks. 

Skep/Permissibility/Presumption: Not a big fan but if you win the argument, I will vote off of it. 

Micropol: Not the greatest fan. Ask me about the specific position before the round. 

Speed: I'm fine if you go fast but you're going to need to go slower than your fastest because I haven't flowed since VBI 2014. 

Other things: Bring a corgi, win 30. 
I presume neg. 
If you have any questions, you can ask me before the round.
