  I have been coaching and judging Lincoln Douglas Debate for 16 years. I believe that LD is a value debate and I look for value and VC clash. I prefer a few good arguments to many, as usually this means arguments that are not as develloped or excessive speed. I am not fond of speed as this is a speaking event and to convice a judge that judge must understand you. I like to hear good use of philosophy, reasoning and or evidence to extend and impact arguments. I expect crystalization of the round and voting issues.
