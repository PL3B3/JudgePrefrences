Strike - Tricks

- I’m good with speed, but be clear. I’ll call clear if necessary but if I have to too much I’ll dock speaks.
- I won't vote for an argument if I don't understand it, it is your responsibility to explain that
- Add me to an e-mail chain when the round starts
- Flashing is prep, so when the flashdrive leaves your computer I’ll stop timing
- I’m a fan of disclosure but I won’t vote against you if you don’t or if your opponent reads disclosure theory
- Default CI, DD, and No RVI, but open to changing if argued in round
- Evidence ethics violations are an automatic loss, and if you initiate evidence ethics claims in round and they’re not true, then you lose for it
- Please weigh, compare, and give good overviews. If your speech is easy to follow and well set-up, I’ll give bonus speaker points.
- Overall, have fun!
