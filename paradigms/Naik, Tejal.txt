  Judging philosophy is simple, the best argument wins. While style points will not swing the judgement, it is important to be passionate about your side, and expect a lively debate. Clarity in addressing the key points raised by the opponent is as important as your own arguments.Do not belittle the opponent or be condescending. It is the debaters responsibility to convince the judge. Be succinct and take into account that while you may know your arguments inside and out, the judge does not. Be careful and deliberate. The delivery rate should be moderate. Evidence is important to give an edge to your arguments. Quality of arguments, combining evidence with common sense, and making sure that your arguments are consistent through out will make a difference.

Scoring is typically between 25 and 30. Will take fairly rigorous notes, and no verbal or non-verbal cues will be given. Ok to have the debaters move around and be animated if they so desire.
