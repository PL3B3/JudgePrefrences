  I debated Lincoln Douglas on the national circuit for three years.

I can understand speed and most philosophies but if you run something really obscure make sure you
explain it well.

I prefer you debate the topic, and only run theory if an actual abuse occurs.

In order to win, you must extend a well-developed argument. One sentence arguments and a priori will
not be a deciding factor.

The main thing I am looking for when choosing a winner comes down to weighing the impacts of your
arguments.
