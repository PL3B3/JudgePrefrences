  Hi!

tl;dr I like strategical decisions - make them in the round and we will all have fun.

My name is Will and I'm a freshman at Harvard University studying Economics and Sociology. I debated LD for William G. Enloe High School in Raleigh, NC and was primarily a lone-wolf debater. During my time in debate, I attended NSD and third week VBI in addition to clearing at a few bid tournaments and receiving a bid to TOC my senior year.

That being said though, I also debated pretty heavily and did well on a traditional circuit which makes me receptive to both traditional flow and tech rounds. (I actually really enjoy a good traditional style round.)

SPEED
Given that it has been awhile since I have done debate, I'll have a harder time understanding super fast spreading but I probably can still manage if you read tags clearly, slow down, signpost well, and enunciate what your standard/VC is.

I will yell clear or slow if I view it as necessary.

FW
I'm best at evaluating util/consequentialist FW's since I was pretty LARP-y in high school but feel free to run whatever you want as long as it is well explained and weighed over your opponents. However, I'm not receptive to AFC at all.

K's
I enjoy a good K (but not a generic one to be found in a backfile) since I am very interested in issues regarding intersectionality and structural power in the world. However, if you run a K, please give me a clear role of the ballot/judge. Additionally, I'm less receptive to hearing rejection alt's so please be creative and give me a good alt. Furthermore, I'm not too experienced with performance K's so be careful if you choose to run one in front of me.

In terms of beating a K in front of me, please make good weighing arguments or contextualize the K in regards to your own case.

THEORY & T
If you run theory and T please don't make it frivolous. That will only make me receptive to your opponent getting an RVI if they have won the RVI debate.

I default to competing interpretations.

Additionally, I think there generally shouldn't be RVI's on T unless the T is unreasonable.

RVI's
I strongly believe both aff and neg should get RVI's on theory, however, if you're going to explain why they don't in an underview, please do it well.

LARP
Personally, I like a good DA however if the links are weak, the links are weak no matter what - I enjoy hearing weighing arguments or weakness of link arguments against DAs.

For CPs, please for your own sake ask about the status of the counterplan(s) in CX so that things aren't awkward when your opponent decides the status without you. Forewarning though, I don't really have too much experience debating or evaluating dispositional CPs so be careful if you make that the CP status.

EXTENSIONS
You don't need to do that much work on extensions if you've won the argument, but please at least verbally extend the argument.

SPEAKS
Generally I'm pretty lenient with speaks. I'll start people off at a 28 and go up and down from there. Things you can do to get more speaks:

-Be polite and nice to your opponent in CX (but this doesn't mean you can't be aggressive)
-Make good weighing arguments
-Try making an impact turn
-Make strategical decisions in rebuttals that may be risky/aren't the most intuitive
-Crystalize the round well
-Be humorous

DON'T DO (can result in drop or losing speaks)
-Be racist/homophobic/sexist/generally offensive in round/out of round/at all
-Be rude
-Steal prep/prep time
-Card clip
-Run oppression good arguments

OTHER
-Please be a decent human being and friendly to your opponent. At the end of the day, I really want both opponents to learn something from the round or come out of it feeling accomplished regardless of who I voted for.
-Be careful when it comes to gender pronouns (if you're not sure - ask about PGPs - my PGPS are he/him/his) and running positions regarding race (search up what a racial microinvalidation is).
-Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions - life, debate, college, clothes, movies - you name it.

Now that you've read all of that (I hope), here's a meme:



Also, if you come up to me and tell me the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise during the tournament, you will have my ever lasting respect.
