I debated for 4 years at Glenbrook South High School, competing 2 years in policy, 2 years in LD. 

I am willing to vote on anything as long as at it is well articulated and impacted relative to your opponents arguments. That being said, if you are going to run spikes in front of me dont expect to win on the argument "they dropped it," if you are going to go for this it needs to be clear and very well impacted. These debates aren't my favorite to hear, but I will listen. I am fine with speed, read as fast as you like but if you are an incoherent spreader do not expect high speaker points.

Theory
 If the other debater is being abusive, run theory and if it is run well ( impacted and anaylsis of in and out of round impacts) I will happily vote on it. Theory is meant to check abuse, not your go to in round offense. Again, RVI's and presumption I will vote on, but I would prefer not to.

CP/DA/PTX/K
Run them well and I will vote on them.
