  I debated for 3 years at Anderson High School. 

The biggest thing for me is clash. If I have to make arguments for you, you are getting lower speaks. Other than that, I will evaluate almost any argument (excluding innately ridiculous strategies like inequality inevitable vs CRT), as long as you justify it. 

If there isn't in round abuse, I normally default reasonability on topicality debates; same with theory, if you read ASPEC as a strategy with a core aff that has been proliferated around the debate world, you have to give me a pretty damn good reason to vote for it. 


Bonus points for teams that reflect genuine topic understanding with specific and relevant arguments against the other side.
