  I did speech and cx debate for St. Mary's Hall High School for four years and attend Bard College now.

I am a tabula rasa judge in terms of argument choice, however I have a few preferences for what a debate should look like.
I appreciate a thorough story in either side's last speech with an overview, and prefer if debaters would refrain from speed reading/spreading.
Please strongly impact your arguments throughout the debate and explain to me why you win at the end of the round (not just why the other team is wrong/loses).

Other small things -
-conceding a claim of another teams means it is true.
-look at me during cross ex/crossfire, not the other team.
-clarity over speed 
-I appreciate humor, if you make me laugh I will reward you with speaker points.
