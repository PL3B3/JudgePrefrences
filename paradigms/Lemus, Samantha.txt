  Experience Debating:
I've had three years of policy debate experience and have been judging tournaments for 2 of the three
I do have a good amount of experience with this topic and look forward to judging more rounds.
I judge rounds based on how well you debate the arguments and style, presentation, and volume go under speaks
all debaters should understand: substance over style in debate
debaters that are disrespectful to their partner, opponent, or th debate space will get their speaks docked.

Affirmatives (How I like them run)
I do like creative affs. personally i'm a policy type person but do receive performance and k affs warmly.
as long as you debate it well.
you don't have to be T but I do prefer that you at least engage with some portion of the resolution

Negatives:
Policy Options
I vote on all CP's (potentially)
creative CP's are great

K's:
K needs to be clear and concise. 
I am familiar with ontology, methodology, epistemology, and language K's

havent voted on a performance K

T/FW/Theory
this is not a problem, but the arguments need to be flushed out and contextualized to the debate
