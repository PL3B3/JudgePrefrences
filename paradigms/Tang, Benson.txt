  I debated for Lynbrook HS on the local and national circuit for 4 years.   

On the most fundamental level, I am okay with any argument so long as it makes sense/is not utterly ridiculous BUT I would enjoy hearing arguments with substance and creativity and ones that demonstrate critical thinking on the part of debaters.  With that said, I feel like debate is a game of persuasion so your main goal is to give me a reason to vote for you.  The team that warrants their claims and does comparative analysis and frame the debate for me will probably win my ballot.

Basically do what you're good at and be smart.   

Oh and be funny. If I am not audibly laughing at the end of every speech you should honestly fear for your speaker points. That includes the 1ac. Costumes are worth extra points. And magic tricks
