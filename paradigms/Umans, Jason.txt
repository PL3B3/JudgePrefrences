While I may judge on dropped points, the burden to rebut minor poorly-developed arguments will be VERY low. as it is for rebutting frank untruths. I am relatively unable to judge "theory" cases intelligently, so these should be avoided. Speed is usually not an issue, except in extremes, when I will make it obvious that I cannot keep up the flow.
