I debated in high school for CCC from 2002-2006 & debated for a year in college before becoming an assistant coach for CCC & Perry.

I don't have any preferences, the round is yours to do what you want & run what you want. I have voted on just about any argument & run just about every argument. Whatever you do will be fine with me.

Each year I judge dozens of tournaments & have been judging since 2006.
