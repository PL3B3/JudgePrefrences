  I debated at brophy from 03-06, currently teach at, coach, and judge for brophy. Have judged practice debates and multiple tournaments on transportation topic. Do whatever you are good at, and have fun doing it. I've debated and judged everything and prefer that debaters are arguing about things they have practiced/thought about the most. Be courteous and be funny and we'll get along fine. If you are not funny, don't try, that doesn't work for anyone.
