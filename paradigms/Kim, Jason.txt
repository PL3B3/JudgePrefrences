  I competed for four years for Monte Vista High School ('11) in Public Forum, Extemp, and Impromptu. I'm currently an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. Please feel free to ask questions before the round. Here are some thoughts:

1. Please be polite and ethical and on time if you can
2. Although I was an experienced competitor, I am not a frequent judge. I am not familiar with this topic
3. Overall, I prefer a lay style of debate. This means speed will likely not help you here.
4. I don't really understand theory debates, and I don't think they have a place in PF. If you're going to go for it, you better be (a) really sure (b) able to explain what it means to me (c) not be counting on the opponent dropping your theory debate as an auto win
5. Please don't give an off time road map. This was my biggest pet peeve when I debated, so if you do it
6. I really like a good framework. Absent that, some impact and direct comparison between you and your opponents is necessary
7. There's a reason PF speech times get shorter - please emphasize voting issues for me at the end of the round to make it easy to vote for you
8. Please stand during 2-way CS and sit during 4-way CS.
9. I think evidence wins Public Forum. If you refute arguments really clearly and logically but without evidence, you'll probably get high speaker points but lose.
