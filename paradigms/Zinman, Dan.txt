  I am a parent judge for Harrison High School in New York, and am a practicing attorney.
  
  I have limited experience in judging debate.
 
I will flow what I can, but you will need to speak slowly. 
  
 Please signpost.
 
 Please time yourselves.
  
 I will vote for the debater who persuades me more. You should not pref me unless you are highly persuasive.
