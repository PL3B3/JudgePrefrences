  I was a former debater for Centennial High School. I have not judged on this year's topic yet.

I debated for three years (9th grade to 11th) under capitol debate. I'm not a fan of cards and evidence so much. I could really care less about how much evidence you have or how much better it is. I care about logic based arguments more. I also prefer a few short and concise arguments that are good rather than a bunch of arguments. In fact if you can make a good argument in 5 minutes then don't use all 8 minutes of your speech and waste my time and yours.

Argument wise I'm a fan of the disad and not really anything else. In fact I'd say anything besides a disad and counterplan is pretty ridiculous.
I also tend to err aff unless your disad and counterplan was incredible.

Be clear with the role of the ballot and why this round was valuable.

Speaker points- I do not tend to give very high speaker points unless you were very impressive. Spreading really fast doesn't mean impressive- in fact, I will probably have a harder time listening to you if you spread rapidly. I consider 27/30 speaker points very good, 24/30 average, and I won't go lower than 21/30.
