  I debated for 4 years at scarsdale high school in ny and got a bid to the toc. I go to Amherst college now. Lex 2014 is my first time judging.

I’m fine with anything, but i haven’t judged so don’t expect me to know anything about the topic or the current trends in debate. The most important thing is to give me a way out in the round. Slow down and tell me exactly what you want me to vote on. I want an easy way out.

You can go as fast as you want, but I am terrible at flowing, so u should slow down a lot on important args. It’s also very possible that I lose focus on the round so if something is very important, make sure to get my attention. I also really don’t care if a really good debater kills a novice. Just don’t be a dick.

Theory: I like it. I default to cometing interps, drop the arg, and no rvi. But I’ll evaluate theory in whatever way you want me to as long as you make the arguments. Probably best at evaluating theory, but that’s just my opinion. I haven’t judged yet so I could be completely wrong.

Tricks: I like them a lot. I don’t want to have to sift through a messy round, and if the round is messy, I’ll probably make the wrong decision.

Util/LARP: Not too familiar with any of this stuff besides like DAs and plans. I don’t really like them tho, and will buy a lot of the common responses to util.

Ks: probably shouldn’t do it. I never ran them and there’s almost a 100% chance that I won’t understand ur K.

Skep: Don’t hate it and ran it a decent amount.

Speaks will be completely arbitrary/ dependent on my mood. If you are funny/I like you, you will probably get higher speaks. If you try to be funny, but are annoying or if I don’t like you, you will get lower speaks.
