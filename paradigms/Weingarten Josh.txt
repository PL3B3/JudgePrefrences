  I think that debate is the most fun and important educational activity in the world. I expect it to be both fun and educational. I believe that debate and rhetoric is an especially important tool for deconstruction of privilege. I tend to prefer teams who are making use of the debate space to that end. I'm willing to judge your hege debate if that's the type of fun and education you really want, but I think there are probably more important things to talk about.


I'm a former coach of a national circuit team which experienced a fair amount of success during my tenure (I was mentioned in the thank-you speech of the team who won the 2014 TOC). I've been focusing more on my day job for the past couple of years and therefore haven't judged many rounds during the last couple of seasons. Don't assume I know the jargon specific to this particular year or your particular case, even if it is a camp case, as I may have just learned the resolution in the judges' lounge. I'm good on jargon specific to debate and I can still flow speed and all that good stuff. At the end of the day, have the debate you want to have, make it the best debate you can show me, have fun, and I'll reward that.

P.S.: Keep it tight on time. At most tourneys, the tab room holds judges accountable for running the rounds on time. Stealing prep can get me yelled at (by coaches/tournament directors who are friends of mine, most likely!) or even potentially cost me money in some cases. You'll understand why I therefore have little patience for side-tracks and delays.
