  I am a parent judge from Ft. Lauderdale High School. I have judged PF on the national circuit, and LD locally. 
I dont have any preferences as to arguments that I like or dislike. Just make sure you are prepared and convincing, however I make my desicion based on the arguments made in the round.
I like a good cross examination, and feel it can be an important part of the round.
I do not prefer spreading, but can understand quick to moderate speaking. I will give a signal if you are speaking unclearly.
If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
