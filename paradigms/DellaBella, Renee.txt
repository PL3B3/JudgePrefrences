  I have been judging LD for 2 years and I am a lay-judge. I dislike "spreading" as I cannot understand or comprehend what the debater is saying therefore , losing. I like respect to the opponent to be able to finish a point or sentence. I also like a lot of eye contact instead of straight reading . Sometimes the debater just reads and a lot of times doesn't even know what they are reading as though someone else wrote it for them. I'm okay with nervousness as it can be very unnerving to present an argument especially in front of a judge. Additionally, I do not like theory, so do not use K's, Counter-plans, etc. Thank you, and enjoy your debates.
