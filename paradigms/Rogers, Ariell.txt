  Yo I'm Ariell Rogers. I graduated in 2005 from Whitney Young High School where I debated for 3 years then debated for SIUC for 2 years. 

That said, I'm a pretty young guy and well schooled in debate theory. I don't have any problems with any arguments, and pretty much open to everything. You should be trying to do all the weighing for the round for me, I can't do the work for you. So I like impact calculus.

I have been judging a little over a year now and there are some fundamental things I expect. Don't just throw around debate jargon unless you know what you're talking about. 

I will admit to being a critical debater, the K done well is my weakness. However if I'm not getting a clear framework as to how to interpret the debate and weigh it, I always default to policy style, that is who has the better impacts. 


I'm good with speed but clarity would be more beneficial towards your speaker points and me flowing all your arguments. The less arguments you go for, is usually the best option.
