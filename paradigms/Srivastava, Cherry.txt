  I'm currently a Junior marketing major at the University of Texas at Dallas. I used to do mainly PF when I was debating, therefore I will be more of a lay judge in LD. I have judged LD on numerous occasions. 
I can largely understand spreading, but if a point is really important, I would like you to emphasize it. If I need you to go slower, I will say clear. 
I flow everything you seem to make important in your speeches.
