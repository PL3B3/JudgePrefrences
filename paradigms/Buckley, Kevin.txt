  I attended Ridge High School in Basking Ridge, NJ. I debated LD for three years and spent the last year experimenting in various speech events as well as Student Congress. I finished up my high school career at the NCFL and NFL nationals in Student Congress.

I appreciate a good speaker in the traditional sense, but that doesn't mean I'll pick you up just because you speak eloquently. I can handle speed to a certain point - so when you speak really fast, understand that I just might not be able to flow everything you say. It's never been the case where speed alone has kept me from flowing a point - but general clarity at that speed. IE if you are going to speak really fast, make sure you're able to speak clearly at that speed.

I have no problem with any form of argumentation (prima facie, theory, K's, etc.) as long as you warrant its use. That generally applies to anything in the round - if you make a claim and can back it up, I'm fine with it. Just make sure they're actual warrants.

Also, don't be evasive/refuse to answer questions in CX - be a proud debater and stand up for what you're arguing about.
