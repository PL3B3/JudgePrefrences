  Have limited coaching/judging experience on the JV level at national tournaments. I was a Public Forum debater in high school, second at TOC. I can follow some speed, but not circuit-level. Familiar with arguments if you explain them well enough, but don't expect a lot of jargon. I will nod and be active showing if I understand what you're saying.
