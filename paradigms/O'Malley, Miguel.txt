Types of debate judged: LD, PF

Debating experience: First year debater in TCNJ Parli. Debate society

Preferred style: Lots of analysis rather than a ton of arguments. Any form of argumentation you see fit to use is fine as long as it's convincing, fully hashed out, and you don't expect me to know anything. (Please, try to stay away from debate lingo/references to obscure philosophers if you have no intention of fully explaining why it matters.) 

Speaking wise, all the obvious things, don't speak so fast that you lose me, be coherent, etc.
