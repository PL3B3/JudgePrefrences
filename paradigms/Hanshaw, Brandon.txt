  This is my second year coaching and judgind debate. My judging philosophy is simple. Generally, the debater or team that convinces me their argument is best that follows the rules and conventions, wins. I'm not a fan of spreading as the practice makes it too difficult to follow an argument. I wish for debaters to speak at a normal rate that allows time for each point to resonate in my mind. I do flow each round and find it helps me to track rebuttal. I think I do a very good job leaving my own personal beliefs at the door before I enter a round.
