  Hi, my name is Winnie Huang and I am a traditional "mom" judge.

I evaluate the round based on the specific standards/VC set up by each side. Whoever has the strongest link to the winning framework wins the round. I am most familiar with straightforward moral frameworks like utilitarian ethics or deontological-based morality. Abstract and intellectually bankrupt frameworks do not appeal to me because of their inherent conceptual density and use of philosophical jargon.

Spreading is a no for me, not necessarily because I don't appreciate its potential educational value, but because I find it difficult to arbitrate a round where hundreds of words per minute are shot off on each side. On the other hand, a slightly brisk pace is fine.

On that technical note, please keep in mind I am a traditional judge when planning your strategies with me. Sign post your arguments and crystallize your speeches to tell me exactly why you are winning. Make the decision easy for me.

Have fun!
