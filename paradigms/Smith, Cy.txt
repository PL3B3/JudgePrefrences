  Cy Smith – Baltimore City College High School
Left to my own devices, I will act as a policymaker. But given a good argument as to why I should take a different approach, I will gladly follow it. Once upon a time, this was known as being tabula rasa. Speed is not a problem; if I am having trouble understanding you, I will let you know. I prefer debaters to be courteous and polite to each other, and in extreme cases points will reflect that. I will disclose my decisions on request, but not until I have finished making my decision and writing my ballot, which may be some time into the next round.
I returned to debate several years ago when my daughter began debate as a freshman in high school. Many years before that, I debated for four years in high school in Northern Virginia and for four years at Dartmouth College, with some success. I taught at the Dartmouth, Georgetown, Redlands, Louisville and Augustana, S.D. institutes (some of which may still be around), and was the assistant debate coach at Dartmouth for one year after graduating but before law school at the University of Virginia. As a result of my break from the activity, I may not know every single one of the current theoretical constructs (especially by acronym), but will do my best to keep up.
In real life, I am a trial lawyer and so I appreciate organization (such as clear signposting and organized arguments), hard work, skill, and creativity. I will gladly answer any further questions about my preferences and/or philosophy, which aren’t necessarily the same thing.
