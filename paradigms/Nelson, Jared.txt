General:
Tech > truth in every situation. 

A conceded argument is true, but still needs an impact.

Spin is important.

I like ev indicts, good author indicts, ev comparisons, etc.

Theory
 Condo is good. 

I've also voted on it occasionally.


It helps if they drop it. 

Anything else is a reason to reject the arg.

Judge kick is a thing If the 2nr says it is (unless the 2AR says it isn't) 
CPs:

They should compete on specific mandates of the plan and not likely outcomes of the plan. 

They should also probably have solvency advocates

Kritiks:
I'm not the best judge for them.


They are core negative arguments and if they have specific links to the plan or advantages I'm all for them.

I generally think extinction and death are bad.

I'm receptive to frameworks that prioritize impacts other than extinction.


Topicality:
*see warning at top of page*

I like these debates.

Evidence is important. 

So is spin. 

There are legitimate warrants for why competing interpretations are good.

There are legitimate warrants for why reasonibility is good.
