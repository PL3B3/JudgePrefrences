  Experience
- LD for Strake Jesuit for four years (2011-2015).

Speed
- Comfortable with speed so long as you speak clearly
- Will say "clear" twice, then begin deducting speaks

Preferences
- I never considered myself a progressive debater, and I don't really care for policy-style arguments. Having said that, I ran Ks, theory/T, plans, and CPs as a debater and I capable of and comfortable evaluating them. I just won't enjoy it. Keep in mind I haven't been on the circuit for a while, and running things I'm less likely to understand carries a risk. 
- I will default to reasonability until you make an argument for competing interps.
- I like a good framework debate. You're more likely to get good speaks if the round goes that way.
- I will generally assign speaks based on strategy/general performance (with the exception of deductions for speaking badly)
- Essentially, you can do whatever you want, but be sure to explain and justify it well.

Other stuff
- Guys, if you're wearing a jacket, for the love of God don't button both buttons. I will judge you (as a person), and I may become distracted in-round and miss something important.
- Try not to be a dick to your opponent. I know that's difficult for some of you, but try.
