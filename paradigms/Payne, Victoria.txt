  I am a new varsity high school level debate judge in Policy. I am a coach who did not compete in high school or college. I prefer a slower pace of speech, but can tolerate spreading at a medium rate. I feel I am a combination of a stock issues and policy maker style judge. I like to see a few issues argued well, rather than just a list of arguments without any depth. Kritiks are not my favorite, but if they are logical I will consider them. I always consider the ethics/morality of what you are arguing for.
