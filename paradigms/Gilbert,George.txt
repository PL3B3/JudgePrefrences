  Hello Everyone!
Here is my paradigm for Lincoln-Douglas debate. I have been judging on and off for about 1 year. In addition, I have experience lobbying at the local, state, and
federal level on a wide range of issues.

If I am one of your judges, I will be looking for the following during your round:


Analysis – The debater will clearly present a logical argument and also effectively refute the opponent’s case.
Proof – There should be a sufficient quantity and quality of evidence to support the case. More evidence is not always better. The contentions should also link back to the value.
Organization - There should be a logical and orderly presentation throughout the round.
Refutation/ Clash – The better debater will demonstrate the ability to critically analyze the opponent’s arguments and develop clear and logical responses with effective use of evidence and examples.
Delivery – The speech must be understandable, interesting, and persuasive. An LD debater should demonstrate effective oral communication skills including; effective reading, clear and understandable delivery, persuasive vocal argumentation, presence, and eye contact.
A last note: I have observed that LD debaters who try to use speed sacrifice a great deal of understandability and persuasiveness. Typically, the amount of evidence added to the case is not worth that sacrifice. As a result, I dislike excessive speed, as I have difficulty flowing the argument, and it seems as though speed becomes more important than persuasion.
