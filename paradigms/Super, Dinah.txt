  Background: 
I debated LD at Lexington High School in MA and graduated in 2007. I also served as Speech Captain for Lexington Debate, and coach people in public speaking. 
As a judge, I flow all arguments, and provide plenty of feedback after rounds. 
Philosophy: 
Theory arguments are fine, as long as they are topical and have real world implications. Please be prepared to explain how you are using this theory, and be able to explain the theory itself in a brief, clear statement. 
Evidence is very important in proving arguments and backing up your case. Please use it. 
Clear, strong and understandable language allows your arguments to be heard, and reflects well on your conviction. I will not allow a person to lose solely based on speaking style, but it can have a strong impact on the way your arguments are heard by anyone. If I can not understand what you are saying, I will yell clear. If I still cannot understand what you are saying, it will be difficult for me to flow it. 
Clearly tell me when you move between arguments so that I can make sure to follow you correctly
I look for crystallization of your arguments by the end of the round, including the real world impact of your arguments and voting points that I should consider. Be sure to iterate voting point by the NR and 2AR. Tell me why you should win, and why I should vote for you.
