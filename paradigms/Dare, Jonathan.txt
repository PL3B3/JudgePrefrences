I'm comfortable with most arguments. I still don't consider myself a good judge for teams that don't read a topical plan, but I have voted for teams that take this approach in the past. As long as you don't read death good I should be fine with it.
Some things I like to see in debates:
- Look at me during CX
- Make arguments that compare the relevance of impact calculus filters. Is magnitude or time frame more important? Why should I disregard low probability arguments?
- Spreading is fine, but when you are speaking make sure you are clear, and show you understand your arguments. If you are clear during the body of the evidence you will definitely get better speaker points. I think it is important to highlight evidence coherently and emphasize your warrants.
- Harmful or intentionally disrespectful conduct will tank your speaker points.
- When explaining your kritik don't be vague. Make sure your 1NC cx and the block makes it very clear what the alt does.
