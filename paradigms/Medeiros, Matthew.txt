  I recently graduated from Coral Springs High School in Broward County, FL with three years of competing in local circuit LD under my belt. I don't have an issue with theory or speed whatsoever. I like to see a road map before each rebuttal. For speaker points, I lean more towards the form of speaking and content then I do speed, but if you do choose to speak fast then be easily discernible. Non topical arguments will be ignored.
