  I debated Lincoln Douglas throughout high school in Youngstown, OH. I am now an international business student at American University. This is my 3rd year judging LD and PF, and each year I accompany several local teams to the state and national tournaments as an assistant coach.

I am comfortable following any speed or style that allows you to present coherently and persuasively. My only warning here is not to give such rapidfire analysis that I am forced to logically piece your ideas together as you signpost. Subsequently, I hold you accountable for every argument you add. If you introduce an excess of information, don’t assume that I’m tallying your auto wins just because your opponent did not address specific cards along the way. 
If a piece of evidence, a subpoint, or a question from crossfire was important, you are responsible for bringing them to my attention. 

Weigh and prioritize your arguments. Attacks should be linked back to some sort of value/criterion structure though I am open to alternative formats. It’s most important to me that you provide the most comprehensive analysis of the topic, so whichever style gives you the ability to realistically frame the topic is acceptable by me.






I prefer clear voting issues linking back to framework. Generally, an effective crystallization will support your value structure, draw my focus to the heaviest points of contention, and evaluate the two worlds proposed by you and your opponent.
