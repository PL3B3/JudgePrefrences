  I did LD Debate for four years at Catalina Foothills High School in Tucson, AZ. I have a B.A. in International Studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I'm currently an MBA student at University of Iowa.

Speaking: You can go fast as long as you are clear. Again, please be very clear as I will not ask for evidence after the round. I am pretty generous in awarding speaker points, in general.

Value/Criterion/Arguments:
I am open to all sorts of argumentation, as long as you articulate why I should vote on an issue. Tell me how your arguments function in terms of the round, and I like when debaters weigh arguments. I am comfortable voting on theory or anything else outside the scope of the resolution. That being said, make sure you clearly explain your arguments if you choose to run something unique.

On the substantive level, please make clear extensions and impact back to one or both standards, as I will not give you much leeway if you make weak extensions and don't articulate the warrant, link, and implication.

So, make the decision easy for me by doing all of the above. Also, feel free to get in touch with me at kcagrawal7@gmail.com.
