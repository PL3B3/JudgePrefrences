  Four years of policy at Blue Valley North HS on the Kansas and national circuits. I have not judged on this topic yet.
I like old-school policy a lot (the politics disad *insert heart eyes emoji*) but wil still happily vote for the k on the neg. 
That being said, no plan text, no win.
Everything else is fair game.
