  I debated for Wellington High School for 4 years and competed in Public Forum. I attended NSDA nationals 3 times twice in Public Forum and once in World Schools. I also attended NCFL nationals twice in Public Forum. So if you have not guessed already I would strongly encourage you to be incredibly clear when speaking and not become incoherent. If at any point, I put my pen down you better slow down.
1) I strongly believe that debate is about communication; I want to arguments interact with each other not just my case outweighs theirs for 27 reasons. Debate is not 2 ships passing in the night.
2) I prefer a more traditional element of debate and would strongly encourage you to make sure all your arguments connect to the resolution in some way shape or form. Please don’t use out there arguments as a way to ambush your opponent I will write them down but will likely not be happy if that is what you are trying to win off of at the end of the round.
3) I will write down all the arguments that I can understand however the arguments must be backed up if you assert something once in one line of your first case chances are when you come back to it as to why you win at the end I will not vote on it. I want to hear you declare voters. I want to hear the arguments with supporting facts.
4) I am down for any kind of arguments you have but it must be understandable; I shouldn’t have to do a bunch of work for you to understand your complex theory argument. If it doesn’t make sense to me, its not on my ballot and I will not vote on it.
5) I am not a point fairy but I am not overly strict. However, I WILL NOT tolerate abusive language or negative remarks about your opponent. You must flow the round on your preferred medium and interact with your opponent’s arguments I don’t care if you think they are stupid this is still a debate round debate.
