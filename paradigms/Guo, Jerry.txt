  I am a new LD parent judge, very traditional so fancy tricks like running Ks, Ts or theory or obscure LD jargons may not work for me to win my vote. I will pick up the one who clearly explains the implications, standards, evidence, framework and especially the crystallizations which convince me. Please don't spread and please slow down as I will have a hard time following everything since I am not used to the LD debate yet. I prefer you disclosing your case to me or emailing me your case before the debate as reference in case I need that to follow you during the debate. For all debaters: clarity: enunciate and make sure you are not going too fast I cannot understand Please explain your evidence in the debate so I may consider and award you points accordingly Be nice and show respect to your opponent.
