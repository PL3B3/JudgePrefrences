  My paradigm is:

Make arguments
Tell me why they matter
Tell me why they mean you win
Obviously, I have preferences (I prefer substantive arguements to procedural ones, I prefer topic specific arguments to theory, I prefer moderate speed to lots of speed or really slow debate, I prefer arguments that are true) but I won't intervene if you do not do things they way I like. I will, however, probably be bored or unhappy. If you are going to do something unusual, though, I prefer that you justify that in round, as part of the "why your arguments matter" part of my paradigm.
