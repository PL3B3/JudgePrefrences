  I have judged over 50 rounds of Varsity Parli. I am comfortable with speed but will call "clear" if I can't understand you. Please terminalize your impacts and provide me with clear sign-posting in your argumentation. I will default to Net Benefits and encourage you to provide me with impact calculus in your final speeches. Make sure you show why your impacts carry more weight than your opponents.
