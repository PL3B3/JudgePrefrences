  Background: Policy debater for 3 years in high school. Currently a junior at Berkeley. Have judged for the past few years at Berkeley.

Winning: Clear and concise, logical flow of arguments wins me over. Establish a framework for each round. Make things easier for me by telling me what criteria are the most important to the round. No new arguments in any rebuttals, you should already know that. If you try to extend an argument that is questionably a new argument, make it convincing for me that you are not trying to bring up a new topic. Basically, have a warrant to every argument. Emphasize your winning arguments, aka what I should be voting on at the end of the round.

I can and will vote on topicality, counterplans, disads, and kritiks. I am more skeptical of T arguments as most of the time, they're run just to suck time out of each speech.

Speed: Do not spread. You can speak fast as long as whatever you are saying is still comprehensible to me. I will ask you to slow down because I do want to hear all the arguments and judge the round as fairly as possible.
