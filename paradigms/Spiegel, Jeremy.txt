  I have been coaching debate in Georgia for the past 9 years, but recently I've become more of travel agent than a coach.

I did not debate in High School or College, for what that's worth.
LD:
We just recently started an LD program at JCHS. I don't know much about it. If were debating in front of me, I'd pretend like it was mini policy round.
Policy:
I like debaters that are flexible. I stress the ability to be just as competent going for the K as a policy argument.

I like good evidence, not lots of evidence. Please ridicule your opponents evidence. There isn't enough of this in debate.


Ks:

I like the K; I find them to be pretty true, but that does not mean that I'll always vote on them. Honestly, if youre a one off K team, I'm probably not the best judge for you. But, dont be scared to go for the K in front of me.

T:

For the neg to win on T, the aff needs to be untopical. Just because you win the standards debate, doesnt mean that you win the T debate.

Theory:

I need a good abuse story.

Speaker Points:

I've discovered recently that my speaks are pretty low. not sure why.
