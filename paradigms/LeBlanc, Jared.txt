  Hello,
I am an experienced Public Forum judge. I am in the process of learning how to flow. Here is what I am looking for in a round:

1. Define your terms
2. Frame your arguments in a manner that appeals to a citizen judge.
3. Use strong sources to validate your claims.
4. Weigh arguments
5. Drive home your impact during Final Focus


Things I love:
Humor
Really nerdy positions that involve higher-level math and science
Statistics
Explaining how standards function logically in the round
Grouping arguments
Turning arguments
Exposing contradictions

Things I hate:
Telling me what LD/CX/PF/SC Debate is supposed to be (bad theory arguments)
Telling me that something is "against the rules" (bad theory arguments)
Debaters who do the "things I love" badly
Speeches I canâ€™t understand
Strategies that rely on the opponent missing something
Unimportant constructive arguments that are then blown up in rebuttals
Jargon
Misunderstanding economic theory
STUDENTS WHO ARE RUDE AND NASTY!
