  Adam was a four-year debater at the Barstow School and a member of its top team his senior year (class of 2016). He was a 2A/1N and read a wide variety of arguments. He prefers smart, substantive clash on a range of different arguments. You should feel comfortable asking him any questions before the debate: he is a very friendly person.
