  I am a parent judge. I started judging novice LD in September 2013, and varsity in September 2014. I can flow spreading to some extent, as long as it is very clear. I will say “slow” and “clear” as needed. I like plans, counterplans, and disads, but I will vote on essentially any argument as long as it is clearly explained.

I am not well read on critical philosophy, so if you chose to run a K in front of me, make sure it is explained. I am fine with ROTBs.

I am not experienced at theory or topicality, if you chose to run it there is a good chance I will not know what you are talking about.

I am okay with extensions that quickly explain the argument and its implication in the round. As long as I understood the warrant in the first speech, you don’t need to repeat it while extending.

You will get high speaks if you sign post well, are efficient with your time, and do very clear crystallization. You will get low speaks if you are rude at any point during the round, including cross examination.

I am fine with flex prep and will not take prep for flashing cases. Don’t use a lot of jargon, and clearly explain impacts of arguments.
