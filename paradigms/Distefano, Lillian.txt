  My judging paradigm for Lincoln Douglas, LD, Debate is a clash of values. The value represents a means to an idealistic, just world. The criterion is the standard by which to measure the opposing values and to ultimately define the value that should be upheld. The contentions are used to uphold the value. Value, criterion and contentions must be clearly stated by both sides.Therefore, the debater that upholds their value and criteria with the strongest contentions and strongest cross x will receive the higher points, thus (generally) the win.Points that are imperative for me in order to judge an LD debate :
Speak clearly and a reasonably appropriate rate- no spreadingMust be clear with your value and criteria Contention and it's value MUST BE crystal clearI do not allow flex timeTime yourselfArgue on logic not emotionsQuotations have no meanings without explanationsMake logical and sensible arguments AND explain your arguments.There is a difference between a passionate and an abrasive or condescending debater-check yourselvesThe debater that most clearly present a logical argument AND effectively refute the opponent will be the victor **Cross X is very important to me and at times defines the winnerMOST OF ALL ENJOY YOURSELVES WHILE PERFECTING YOUR CRAFT
