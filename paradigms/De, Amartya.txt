  My judging preferences are more traditional than progressive. I have over 5 years of coaching experience and did LD as a student.

Speed: I don't prefer that you spread, but you can speak at a quicker pace than conversational.

Theory: I prefer to hear non-theory debates. At times, it might be relevant to the round, so in that case, make it good theory and not bad theory.

K: I don't know enough about K's to vote on them.

Framework: It is essential that you lay out your FW in the beginning and EXTEND throughout the round. Don't just assume I know what your FW is. Also teams may agree with FW if they wish.

Evidence: I do not like teams that misconstrue evidence. If you do this you risk getting dropped. Make sure you always cite your evidence. Similarly, if you are refuting evidence, don't misconstrue THEIR evidence!

Cross X: I flow it. Be courteous. Extend any important points from Cross X in your speeches.

Crystallization: I prefer in the last speech, you don't do anything other than crystallize. No line by line refutations at this point - just give me voters.
