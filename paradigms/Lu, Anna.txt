  I debated for Palo Alto High School on the national & local circuit for 4 years and now attend Columbia University. 

I will try my best to evaluate the round based on what arguments are made as long as they are clearly impacted and warranted (speed is fine). I am willing to vote on any argument that you win on — topicality, friv theory, Ks, policy, tricks, framework — but if you’re reading dense/uncommon Ks or frameworks, go slower and be clear about what it means. 

Slow down for tags & authors. If I don’t catch your arguments, I won’t vote on them, so be clear. I will call “clear” and “slow."

I’ve been told I'm a speaker point fairy. Speaks are awarded for:
Overall strategyClarity & crystallizationBeing a good/kind/polite/cool personWeighing & impacting
My threshold for extensions is author name, claim, and a semblance of a warrant. (I will not vote off an extension of only the author name, but my threshold is also lower for conceded arguments)

Please try to provide a copy of your case to your opponent (flash, pass pages, email chain, etc.) 
Don’t steal prep. You don’t have to take prep for flashing, but don’t take inordinately long or I’ll dock speaks.

Have fun and please don’t be an asshole
