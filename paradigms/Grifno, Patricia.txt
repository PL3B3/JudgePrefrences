  I do not enjoy spreading, arguments need to be clear and well-developed throughout the debate. I rarely give low-point wins which means that speaking, clarity and argumentation are generally what I will look at first. Here our some specifics: 
Case: Case is great--aff make sure you take a clear stance, no severence or unclear advocacies. Neg, case turns are GREAT if they are well done. 

Kritiks--I don't enjoy kritical debates because I prefer debating the resolution, not whether or not the resolution is bad or the starting place etc. I prefer role playing to discursive/mindset strategies.
Theory--I do not like theory debate and will not evaluate RVIs. Unless the debate round has truly become abusive, don't run it I won't buy it and frankly find those debates bland and uninteresting.
High speaks: be clear, concise, polite, and stand during round. I rarely give 30s, but if it is earned I am open to the idea. 
Finally, with all of this said, a good argument is a good argument and I will do my best to evaluate everything.
