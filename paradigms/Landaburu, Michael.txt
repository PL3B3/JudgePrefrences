  Michael Landaburu: Christopher Columbus High School

I competed for 4 years as an LDer for Christopher Columbus High School. 

Speed is fine when clear. I strickly vote on standard debate and think some type of standard is always needed. I do not vote on theory, counterplans or extra resolutional arguments. 

If you have any questions, ask me prior to the round.
