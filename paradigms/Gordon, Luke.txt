  Overview
Debate is a game so play it as such. I am not a games player because I feel that ruins the very point of debate do it as you want. I love seeing different arguments and I evaluate it as a game. I debated for 4 years and am now helping out coaching on the high school circuit. I am a tabs judge I judge solely off the flow. I was a K debater in high school and loved every minute of it.

Speed:

I am fine with speed slower on the tags help but please do get the arguments out there. Like I said this is a game and I am merely the observer.

T:

I have a high threshold for T. You really have to prove the abuse to me I am not one to vote on potential abuse that doesn’t mean I haven’t though. If the aff is being abusive please don’t let my philosophy scare you from running T. I ran T a lot in high school and recognize the strategic value it creates. T I view as more of a gateway issue

Theory:

Fine go ahead just make sure you explain why I should drop the team because of the abuse

CP:

These are fine I am good with the PIC but I look down upon them. I understand why they are ran however don’t make it such an abusive PIC that I lose sleep at night for voting on it.

K:

The K is cool, however I know how abusive they are. I LOVE FRAMEWORK BEST! I know debates are won and lost by it. I love reading philosophy and love keeping up on it. I also realize that the K is abusive in all ways but love the game that they present.

Aff:

Performative aff’s are fine but the more sketchy and screwy I think you are the more ground I grant to the neg to answer it. I do judge off the flow but if I think the aff is just spiking out of everything I am more apt to listen to the neg’s abuse story. But then again I ran those aff’s in high school so please if you do run them correctly!
