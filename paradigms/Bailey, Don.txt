  My ideal round that I would like to judge includes debaters exploring the limits of verbal execution and comprehension meaning speak as fast as you want, I debate college LD so I can flow it! Additionally, I enjoy when debaters are able to defend multiple responses to a single argument, not only does it make my job easier but it makes the debater feel a lot more confident about the clash. This could have been a much shorter judge file to read if I would have simply stated that I am willing to hear any argument as long as it links, if it doesn't, I may still vote on it unless your opponent tells me it isn't topical. The winner will always receive perfect speaker points from me and if permissible the loser will as well, otherwise i default to the next closest number. I feel that a debater's unique style of speaking is his or her own view of perfection and I refuse to punish a debater for doing an inevitable task... i.e. expression.
