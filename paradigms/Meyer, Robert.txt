  I am a new judge. The Yale Invitational will be my first experience as a judge and spectator of LD debate. Anything you can do to make my flowing easier will help you in the round, so a well laid out argument with clear value/criterion/contentions and concise voting points at the end is recommended. Arguments must be relevant to the resolution. I donâ€™t care much for esoteric points that do not affirm or negate the issue at hand. Please do not go any faster than what is considered a fast conversational pace: I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to argumentation. Define any debate jargon that a layperson wouldn't be able to immediately interpret. Don't try reading Kritiks, Theory, or any micropolitical arguments- I will not vote on any of them. If you present well thought out arguments about the topic that impact back to a framework in a persuasive and well-paced manner, you will get high speaker points and have a better chance of doing well in that round.
