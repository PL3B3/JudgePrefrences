LD Paradigm:
I'll listen to pretty much anything. I like good clash and clear articulation of why your arguments should win the round.

I'm pretty liberal with speaker points as long as you are a clear communicator, keep eye contact, and don't do anything particularly silly like swear or physically assault your opponent. 

feel free to e-mail me if you want some sort of clarification: grandsham@gmail.com
