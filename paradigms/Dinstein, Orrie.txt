  I coached LD in the 90's as a volunteer for Francis Lewis high school in Queens and we won the NYC championship in 1995. I am now a parent judge for the Byram Hills high school team.

I am a pretty open minded judge, and willing to accept all styles but do have some preferences:

1) I like real debate meaning debaters who engage rather than ignore each other and just look for dropped points.
2) I like arguments that are warranted with legit cards (just because you found a quote by someone doesn't mean it's a legit card). And if you're going off the reservation (supporting genocide or relying on space aliens) you'd better have a really well warranted case and a bad opponent.
3) I'm fine with speed (to a reasonable extent) - just remember - if i can't flow it - it's your loss.
4) I like crystalization at the 2NR and 2AR - give me voters. Don't assume i remember every brilliant comment you made.
5) Don't waste your time chasing minor points that often don't matter - focus on the VC and the key contentions - they are usually what will win or lose your round.
6) Although I'll obviously take into account dropped arguments, a dropped argument doesn't get you an auto win so don't start cruising just because your opponent dropped a point.

Happy to answer any other questions you have before a round.
