  Experience: I debated for American Heritage in Plantation for four years on the national circuit for Public Forum. I have experience judging on the national circuit.

TL;DR: I am the epitome of a flow judge. The definition of tech over truth. I do not care how squirly the argument is as long as it is well warranted, heavily carded, linked, and weighed appropriately. Bonus speaks for jokes (I like sarcasm, If you think your opponents responses are terrible make it abundantly clear), 30s for food, 20s for quadpods, and card dumps expected. Auto win if you have chipotle come and cater in the round...I don't think this will ever happen but if it does props to u!

Cases: I don't care what the argument is, but you need warrants, cards, and links. Cards need source names. You can put framework if you want, I don't really care, but if you will be extending framework throughout the round I would rather you put it in case. I'd rather no quotes at the top; huge waste of time.

Rebuttal: Makes sure you actually respond to their arguments because I hate beating around the bush. The more cards the merrier.

How I Vote: If you don't give me weighing mechanisms then I get to vote for whatever I want. I'll still vote for whoever I think should have won, but weighing makes my job a lot easier. Anything you want to say in FF should be in summary besides terminal defense. The way I vote is by looking at the whole of the args presented and using the framework set out to me by both teams I make a decision. Impacts are incredibly important so make them clear.

Misc: Although I am a progressive judge please no K or theory debate. Jargon is fine. 
Of course I am not going to flow cross but that doesn't mean I don't want to see a show. Expect a full discloure and helpful comments after the round unless you or tab specifically asks me not to. Also, I will not disclose speaks. 
Any questions feel free to ask before round or email me at msorbet@ufl.edu
