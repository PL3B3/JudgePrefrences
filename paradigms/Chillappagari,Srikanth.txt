I like well-explained arguments and impact analysis in relation to those arguments.

1. CP/DA
- Again DA's need to have well explained internal links and impact calculus.
- CP's are ok, I need to know how it is competitive.
- If you choose to make a permutation make it well explained.
2. K's
- These debates are the ones that I am the least inclined to, I will evaluate it, but you need to explain how the K affects the debate space and the real world.
3. Phil
- I am probably going to have the most trouble judging these debates (along with Kritiks) unless it is simple/traditional.
4. Theory
- Go slower on theory and explain super clear what the violation is and how theory as an argument functions to resolve it.
5. T
- Same as theory explain why their definitions or whatever is bad for debate and how T solves it.
6. Traditional
- Yes.
