  Hello!

I am a former LD debater for Lake Highland Prep (1st year out). I debated on the national circuit with decent frequency for five years and am familiar with most argument styles. I debated locally as well. Any type of argument is fine in front of me. I've read K arguments a lot and have experiences with those. I am not a huge fan of theory and wouldn't recommend reading it unless it's necessary.

In general have a nice, civil debate and everyone goes home happy! Yay debate!
