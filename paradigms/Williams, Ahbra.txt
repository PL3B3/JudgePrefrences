  I debated LD for 4 years at Mercer Island High School and am now a junior at University of Michigan.

In rounds, I will listen to any argument as long as the debater explicitly relates it to the resolution. Assume I do not have any particular background in a certain argument because I appreciate when debaters state the argument rather than only vaguely hinting at it. I like at the end of the round when debaters crystallize and show why I should vote for either side; I do not want to have to pour over the flow at the end of the round trying to decide who should win, both debaters should paint me a picture as to why they should win and make my job easy for me.

I do not really like education arguments, they seem to me to be a cop out. I also do not really like speed with the intention to spread opponents, and if I feel a debater is doing this I will dock speaker points. Also, I hate new arguments.
