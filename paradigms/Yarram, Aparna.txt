Types of Debates Judged: Congress, PF


Debating experience: Advancement chair for TCNJ's Society for Parliamentary debate team; have been debating in American Parliamentary Debate style (APDA) for about a year.


Preferred Debating Styles: Paced speaking and limited debate jargon. Arguments should have warranting and impact and the use of numbers or concepts thrown around without any context will win any favors. I don’t really have any biases against any arguments/cases so run what you run best. Analysis is a huge factor in decision and rebuttals are generally meant for issues to be applied in new ways. Humor is good, snarky/mean isn’t. Decision based on what is on flow. Please provide clear framework for the round.
