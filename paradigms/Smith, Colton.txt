  My name is Colton Smith. I graduated in 2013 after debating for Wenatchee High School in WA. I primarily debated on the national circuit and qualified to the TOC my junior and senior year.

Novice, JV, and Traditional/Local Varsity Paradigm: Do whatever you're best at or want to do and enjoy them novice times.

Varsity Paradigm:

I default to competing interps. Fairness is a voter, education may or may not be. 

Things I will not vote for under any circumstance:
Skepticism (Using skepticism to justify a framework is fine)Framework triggersA prioris or NIBs that are unrelated to the standardPermissibilityUnwarranted arguments
Things I enjoy:
ArgumentsUtilPlans, CPs, and DAsPermsImpact turnsImpact defense (I believe in terminal defense and give more strength to defense than most judges)Weighing (Debaters do not do enough of this but it will take you a long way in front of me)Extinction first argumentsTextual advocaciesTheoretical reasons to prefer utilCX checks
I base speaks purely off technical proficiency. If you are aff, make your 1AR good and you will get good speaks. 

If an argument is conceded you do not need to extend the warrant, just the claim.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round!
