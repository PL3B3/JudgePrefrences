  I debated competitively in high school from 2005-2009. In the meantime, I've been out of the debate loop, but did a BA at Georgetown and MSc at LSE. I've judged this year, so I understand what's hip, but I'm still a bit of a curmudgeon. That being said, when I debated in high school, I was a fan of experimenting with the form and structure of debate. So, as many other judges say, I'm open to whatever as long as you give me a good reason.

I like theory and philosophy, but only when the debaters have a deep understanding of the text. I am really bugged when debaters utilize theory for the sake of exclusivity.
