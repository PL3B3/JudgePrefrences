I will judge the flow.
Weigh your impacts at the end.
Don't be mean at all.


Policy:

I tend to try and be as tabula rasa as possible, but:

I default to judging the round in an offense/defense paradigm, as a policymaker who weighs the net benefits of the plan against the status quo or some alternative advocacy. I default to competing interpretations on topicality, and abuse on all other theory arguments. I generally do not think topicality can be a reverse voting issue, but I am open to criticisms of topicality. I generally think that Plan Inclusive Counterplans are fine, and that dispositionality is preferable to conditionality.

I would prefer that you go for the arguments you are best at running, whether it be a critique or politics/process CP. I also enjoy impact turn strategies and good topicality arguments.

Critical arguments: Yes - but give me an alternative text.

Speed is fine as long as you are clear.

Paperless Debate: I prefer to be on an email chain so I can look at the evidence you focus on during cross-x. Prep time ends when the flash drive comes out of your computer or the email is sent.

Public Forum:

See the haiku.

I expect arguments to flow through the summary speech.

Lincoln Douglas:

Read the haiku and the policy paradigm and then ask me if you have questions.
