  This is my second year judging LD. I like to see fully developed arguments that include examples and evidence, as well as a clear link back to the resolution.

Speed is OK, but if I don't understand you, or can't follow you, I probably won't be able to appreciate your case.

I think it is important to define terms when their precise meanings are necessary, but find many debaters wasting time defining uncontroversial words and not saving time to provide evidence for their contentions.
