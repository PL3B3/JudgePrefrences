  I am a relatively novice judge but I have prepared myself extensively

I would like the debators to be loud and clear. Excessive spreading will make me want to take off speaker points. Be prepared to show your evidence if it is questioned. Make sure you extend your arguments and make your impacts prominent in the final rebuttals.

My philosophy is simply to listen to both sides and determine which
arguments best win me over in each round, independently. I am in no way a
professional at all of this and do not respond well to outlandish kritiks or
things that appear extra-topical unless they are well formulated points with a
clear outline.
