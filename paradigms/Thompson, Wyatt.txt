  I can hang. I like a good framework debate best. I did debate in Texas in HS and have been judging the national circuit for a couple years. I'm a tabula rasa of course (name that philosopher). But having preferences is unavoidable (name THAT philosopher). 
Things I like:
Insightful argumentsCrystalization and Big Picture [Like for sure do this. If you understand your argument, you can say it in less than 3 sentences at the end and it'll help me connect my flow]FrameworkRespectCreative argumentation
Things I do not like:
An assumption that I've already heard your T-ShellCalling your opponent by their first name---it weirds me out. I don't know you guys.Disclosure Theory---bleh. I'll vote if you make me. But I won't be stoked about it.Spreading the content of your evidence to the point of incoherence.Doing work for youOh! Don't read a tagline and then start A,B,C,D. Say interp, violation, etc. The assumed format is annoying and being a Tabula Rasa, if I don't understand it, I won't pick the pieces up for you.
I'm a good judge. Every person I've ever voted for really deserved it.
