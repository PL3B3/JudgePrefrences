My two main concerns with LD Debate are:
1. Underlying Values--LD should primarily be a debate of underlying values, and arguments should be given for why the values should be accepted. LD arguments should not be focused on the practicality of implementing a proposal. In addition, I expect to see a meaningful clash of values.
2. Crystallization--I place great value on each debater offering a concise explanation for why they believe that they have won the round. This explanation needs to include a summary not only of their own arguments but the major arguments of their opponent as well. A weighing mechanism should be included in crystallization

Other concerns:
-Some speed may be helpful, but I don't believe that spreading is needed. If I do not clearly understand the argument, I cannot evaluate it.
-I am far more interested in a few well-reasoned arguments that many arguments with little support.
