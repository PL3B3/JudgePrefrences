  I'm a tab judge. Explain why I should vote on your arguments, instead of just explaining what your arguments are. I don't mind speed, but if I can't understand you then I can't flow your argument. I'm not a huge fan of critical arguments, but I will listen to them as long as they are explained clearly and have a clear link.
