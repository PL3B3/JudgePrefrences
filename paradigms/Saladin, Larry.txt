LD Judging Philosophy:
I am a traditional judge. The basis of my decision rests on the value, criterion and contentions in the round. Competitors should be crystal clear as to why their value is more relevant than their opponents. I will not evaluate any theory arguments and I will certainly not base my decision on the extension of some incomprehensible spike in a beefed up framework. Present well-developed, well-warranted arguments that impact back to the standard. I absolutely deplore speed debate. I want to clearly understand how each argument functions in the round and it is up to the competitors to make that clear to me.
