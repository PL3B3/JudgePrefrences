  I have judged at many tournaments before, but I am new to LD, so don't run arguments too complicated for me to understand. Make sure your arguments are realistic and make sense. Be sure to make eye contact, as it makes you more convincing. 

Speak clearly and do NOT spread. Don't be rude during crossfire/cross examination. Your speaker points will be docked if there is rudeness or unnecessary aggression during the round. Be emotional when you speak, it helps me think that you care about what you speak about. Most importantly, have fun.
