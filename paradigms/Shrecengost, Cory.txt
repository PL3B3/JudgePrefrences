  My name is Cory Shrecengost and I am a freshman at the University of Nevada, Reno, studying business. I was heavily involved in speech activities during high school and debated collegiately for UNR. I competed in parliamentary debate for UNR and PF a few times in high school.

Short Version
-Plans/DA/CP are okay with me.
-I have a basic understanding of the K, although you need to clearly explicate the literature.
-Procedurals are fine with me. I prefer substance but I have no problem pulling the trigger on a really well executed T debate.
-I believe that debate is equally a speech event and good presentation is important. I can handle a slightly faster than conversational pace, but if you spread in front of me (and ignore my paradigm) your speaker points will reflect it.

Long Version
I consider myself to be fairly tabula rasa, although that said, I prefer more traditional arguments. I’m fine with/enjoy that policy style debate has started to become more prominent in LD debate, meaning I’m fine if you want to run Plans/DA/CP in front of me. I have a basic understanding of how a K functions, although that said unless you’re either really good at explaining the literature and how it functions in round, I’m probably not the best judge for this type of argument. Also, your K needs an alternative or I won’t vote on it. Procedurals are fine with me, although unless they are being genuinely non-topical, I would prefer a more substantive debate.

I value presentation in debate and don’t like the shift towards all out speed versus clear articulation of arguments that the community has made. Please do not spread in front of me, otherwise your speaker points will take a hit.

Most importantly, be respectful. If you are rude or verbally abusive in round your speaker points will drop drastically.

If you have any questions that aren’t covered in this paradigm, feel free to ask me before the round! I’m a fairly new judge so I haven’t had much time to fully develop this paradigm.
