  I'll be judging under the name: Ashutosh Jog for Cal Invitational 2014

Experience: 3 years in HS Varsity LD. Made it to outrounds at Stanford and Berkeley Invitational. I have since left debate, so treat me as you would a lay judge.

Speed - I can flow pretty well. However, if you do spread or speak fast and I don't catch what you say, I'll ignore the argument.

Fancy LD stuff like (theories, K's) - I'm not particularly familiar with them and I generally don't like them.

Arguments:
- I like smart turns
- Please don't impact or accuse your opponent of supporting genocide or something similar, I will shoot you down on bad impacts, even if your opponent does not respond
- Don't fire cards one after another without impacting

**I believe that debating involves presenting equally as much as arguing. Hence, I'm not a fan of spreaders (sorry), yellers, very rude people, etc. I believe a good debate involves a clear and understandable exchange of arguments and respect. I will award a significant amount of speaker points on this.

I wish you all a good debate.

Brian.
