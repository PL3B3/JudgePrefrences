  I am not a circuit judge, and did not debate when I was in high school. That said, I have judged local rounds in the WBFL league all year. I value persuasion, communication, and clear convincing positions. Do not spread. I prefer slow, persuasive style of debate. I also tend not to vote on theoretical arguments. I prefer traditional LD.
