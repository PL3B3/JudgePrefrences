Do not call me judge.

You need to debate like you want to be debating. Ask for pronouns, be respectful, and you'll be fine. I've been on both ends of the spectrum. At the end of the day this is YOUR debate, not mine. I'll vote for whatever is on my flow, unless told otherwise. I will listen to anything as long as your arguments have a claim, warrant and impact. Below are just little bullets about my debate background, take them how you wish. If you can stay on the line by line and know how to make arguments, I'm probably a good judge for you.

I work at multiple debate camps over the summer, meaning, I probably know some of the lingo you're using. However, that doesn't mean you don't have to explain it.

Minor things-
-Tech vs. Truth- Just because an argument goes conceded doesn't mean you automatically win. You need to warrant out and communicate to me WHY it's important.

-I really don't care if you defend a plan or if you don't defend a plan.

- Trigger warnings are important. Do not forget this. 

-I did/still do a lot of K debate (Latina/oism, performance, Fem, Anti-Blackness, Queerness, etc) However, that doesn't mean I don't know the ins and outs of "traditional" arguments (I've worked at camps that solely ran traditional arguments). Although, because of my experience with literature, I'll admit, I'm a better judge for K debate.

-I think Framework becomes a wash when the 2nr just goes for "bones". If you're going for Framework in front of me you need to give me substance and throw out a lot of the jargon in later speeches. If you're a K team, debating framework in front of me shouldn't be a problem. Also, if you're reading framework, fairness is not an impact to go for in front of me. However, if fairness is the only thing ya got, then do what ya gotta do. 

-I actually like T, but the same comment about framework goes here. If you're going for T, I want more than just bones. Take the T debate and package it to fit the 1ac. I want a contextualized T/FW debate over blippy blocks.

-I was/still am a very techy debater, but if you're going to be techy make sure you package your arguments accordingly. I hate when someone is going for more than one thing and they don't clash well together.

-I don't like restricting debaters from what they're good at and I couldn't mean this more. I've voted for plans, DAs, T, Ks, Cp, Condo, theory, case turns, etc. Do what you need to do.

-If you're a high theory team, I want more than just your cool 10 syllable words. I want you to unpack the 10 syllable word and apply it to the debate. Otherwise I'm lost and you will probably lose.

-Have Ethos. Lots of Ethos.

-Partner feeding you an argument for your rebuttal/constructive speech? I'll probably just flow it, regardless if it comes out of your own mouth. I think it's important to have partners that catch your slips and think this is totally fine with me. The line is drawn when it's repetitive. Do not interrupt a speech continuously. It's annoying, and makes your partner look bad. 

-I flow everything. 

-Case debates are a lost art. Make the art great again. 

-Permutations need net benefits

-Performance? I dig.

-Offense vs. Defense.

-I'm known for being really direct. If I say something that comes off rude/mean, I promise I'm not trying to be mean. I just really want everyone to do better. I also have a resting mean person face, but i'm actually really nice. 

- I relatively give high speaks, mainly because I think speaks are arbitrary. However, if you sound like a dying cat, I'll adjust accordingly.
