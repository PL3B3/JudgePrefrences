  I am a parent judge. I like to hear debate about the resolution. Counter plans are okay. I have a background in teaching and real estate and I am politically moderate, though these won't intentionally change the way i judge-I'll listen to any argument. Go slow and explain arguments, and be persuasive. I don't understand technical language, but I will take notes and attempt to evaluate the round based on the arguments made. 
I have judges at several tournaments. 

note- I am a bad judge to read very complicated frameworks or theory arguments. If i dont understand them it will be difficult to vote on them.
