I like a good line by line, if i have to try to find your argument i wont vote your direction. Show me a clear clash and give it reasonable analysis. I'm not a fan of speed but i can follow it if you are clear, however it will not neccessarily help your case and i would rather you just didn't.

In the debate make sure you say everything that you need to and make sure that you don't leave it up to me to figure it out, I like good impact debates and really like to see clear clash on value and criterion debate as well.

Have fun.
