  Coaching and judging high school policy debate in my second year, I am not a great theory judge. However, I love Kritiks!
As an "outsider" at the Dartmouth Debate Institute, I learned to appreciate unique ideas and hard work. That is critical in a good debate. Your ability to use what you have to the best of your ability is imperative.

Anything that can make a debate interesting and extend the intellectual challenge of the debate is a plus. However, a good framework is also welcome to defeat the K. I look for solid arguments with unique analytics. Analytics alone without evidential support is weak to me, but using limited evidence and a great analytic is often brilliant and wins my approval on that front.

Solid disadvantages with current evidence is also great asset in policy debate that is greatly admired. Unique affirmatives with great blocks show the effort of the debater in research that is also greatly appreciated in the round.

I expect clarity. The ability to spread is a great asset. However, as a judge, it is expected I can hear clearly your arguments or they are not on my flow. Emphasize your tags!

What I extremely dislike is attitude toward the opposing team. Your intellect and preparedness is what should win, and if it is a close round filled with great clash, all the better. However, condescending attitude and an attempt to humiliate the opponent in a close round could cost you a win. Be professional and show your best abilities. Most of all enjoy the learning!
