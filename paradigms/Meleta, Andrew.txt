  UPDATED for Harvard 2018 

I debated for four years at Timothy Christian School, NJ from 2009-2013 at the national level. I coached for Timothy Christian from 2013-2017 while in college. I graduated from George Mason University in May 2017 with a BS in Economics. I currently work in Washington, DC at a think tank. 

I haven't judged much in the past 1-2 so do not assume I am the most up to date with frequently used evidence, strat, norms, etc. I'm ran almost every type of arg in high school and am comfortable understanding most things at high speed. But slow it down a little bit from your fastest. This is best for me to understand what you're saying.
