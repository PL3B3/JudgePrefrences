  This used to be a detailed paradigm, it isn't anymore. Just run what you are comfortable with, keeping these four guidelines in mind:
Please identify clear voters. I won't search the flow for reasons to vote for you, it's your job to figure out why you are winning.Evidence is awesome, internals matter more than taglines. Don't overtag. If time/rules allow, I WILL CALL FOR CARDS.Kritiks are fine, but I rarely find them persuasive on a cost-benefit level. You need to provide solid framework analysis. Do not assume that I know your authors.I like theory debates provided that you give well-justified and well-impacted standards. The Interp-Standard-Violation-Impact framework is usually effective. My threshold is probably a little on the high side.
About me:
I debated for three years (2008-11) with South Anchorage HS (AK) in LD. However, I've always preferred CX when it comes to observing/judging. The Alaska circuit is small/traditional, but I've come to prefer more progressive argumentation gleaned from some national circuit exposure. I've debated in front of parent volunteers, college parli (Worlds/BP-style) debaters, and experienced circuit judges, so I guess my background is kind of a combination of many different approaches. I attend the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (non-debating).
