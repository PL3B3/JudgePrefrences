  I debated 03-05 for Federal Way and have judged ever since. I am not a Tabula Rasa judge, so don't let me catch you on any BS.

1) speed is fine. If not I'll say "clear."
2) you can literally run anything you want in front of me. All I ask is that you validate the use of it. Be very sure to keep this next point in mind, since 05 I have not gone out of my way to read topic literature or look into the nuances of various debate strategies that have evolved since 05. So, if you try to PIC, trigger skep, etc, I might know what you're talking about or I might not. Its in your interest to assume I don't know, and proceed to explain it to me. However, I always lean towards reasonability so if you're running something crazy just understand you'll need to do a little more work for me.
3) when using theory you better make it really clear why the round justifies it. I have serious concerns about debaters resorting to theory in every round. Unless actual in round abuse is occuring I frankly won't care, and if you make the round stupid because of it I reserve the right to judge you harshly for it.
4) I'd appreciate not having to default to my own preferences. Make it really clear what should come first in the round; theory violation, link to a k, or standards debate.
