  I have judged around 25 LD rounds in total, including rounds at bid tournaments.

I am what most of you would consider a “lay” judge or a judge who is not progressive. That being said, I do not like spreading and will not flow or vote on any argument that I do not understand. I do not understand how theory or topicality functions and will not vote on either – debate should be about the resolution, not about how each side should debate.

I prefer stock arguments that anyone can understand. I am not well versed in philosophy, so I will probably vote on the contention level offense rather than the value criterion debate. That does not mean that I will disregard the framework completely but rather than in a muddled framework debate, I’ll vote off of the contention level.

I prefer not to hear kritiks, plans, counterplans, etc. I am fine with listening to disadvantages, though, as long as you explain their function in the round clearly. Just to reiterate, I will not vote off of any argument unless I know how it functions in the round and the content of the argument.

I will base speaker points on strategy and speaking skills.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me before the round. Lastly, remember to enjoy the round! Debate's a great activity, so always make sure that you're having fun.
