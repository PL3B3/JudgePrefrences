When it comes to LD debate I'm pretty old fashioned. I don't like speed and I think there is little or no reason to allow an argument to go unaddressed i.e. I don't like drops. Critiques and overviews are fine and a properly run counter plan is not a problem with me in the right context. I expect debaters to be cordial and persuasive; I don't mind aggressive stances but I don't need to be yelled at. I'd rather hear a good argument then technical jargain, but I do believe in fairness when it comes to the responsibilities of each side (no new arguments in last rebuttals, no important drops, and the like).
