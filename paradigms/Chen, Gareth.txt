  Experience: 4 years of Policy in high school *(with a caveat)
Affiliation: Debate Rhode Island

I debated 4 years for Bellarmine College Prep in California. *However, I debated almost exclusively in a local league, for parent judges. As a result, I'm not as well-versed in a lot of the more esoteric arguments in policy (Ks, CPs, Theory, etc.). That being said, I know what they are, and if you can explain them well, I will vote on it. Moderate speed is ok, but I'll either ignore or interpret things I don't hear as I see fit. I like hearing clash, and I'll give you points for particularly good questions in CX. I also don't have a lot of experience judging, so make sure you signpost and impact clearly.
