  I was a Lincoln Douglas debater in high school. I graduated in 2010 and now attend Knox College. I’m majoring in International Relations and Psychology. I haven’t exactly kept up with the debate world since then, but I do judge at tournaments during winter break.

If I can’t understand you I’ll tell you once. If I say something it’s probably because you’re speaking too quickly. If after that I still can’t understand you, I won’t get all of your arguments on my flow, and I won’t take them into account.

I would prefer that you have a value/criterion, and that you relate them to the resolution. If you don’t, be sure to tell me how you want me to evaluate the round.

If you have any other questions just ask me before the round

Public Forum

I debated public forum once during my junior year of high school. It was really fun and I vaguely remember how the coin toss, times, etc. work. I'm pretty much open to anything you want to argue, and I'm pretty well versed in most "debate jargon" if that's what you're into.
