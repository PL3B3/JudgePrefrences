Bio: debated mostly on the circuit, received five bids to the Tournament of Champions and mostly read util/theory/topicality and a few simple framework args.

I have no idea what the Jan/Feb topic is so please read theory :D 

Util: 1
Theory/Topicality: 1/2
Kritik: 2
Framework: 3

TL;DR - I am not biased towards arguments, but limited by my ability to understand certain ones.

Speed - Keep in mind:
1) i'm a sleep deprived college student
2) i didn't flow when I was a debater
3) spreading has no valuable skills in the future unless you're really good at rapping
4) If you're breathing really obnoxiously, I don't know if I'm supposed to call an ambulance or perform CPR

Please do an email chain if you're spreading fast: my email is hbw2118@columbia.edu

Framework -

Kant - I heard he's a racist person so I probably would not trust him.

Theory/T - How else are you supposed to win rounds without doing prep? It can be as frivolous as you want.

I default competing interps, drop the argument (but easily convinced by drop the debater) no RVIs, presuming aff but permissibility negates.

Please don't read spec cp status i've heard my teammates go for it too much.

I EVALUATE DIFFERING THEORY SHELLS AS STRENGTH OF LINK. I WILL NOT IGNORE A SHELL JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY TOPICALITY COMES BEFORE THEORY

K’s - please explain the links well in cx or in the speech + how the alt solves

High Theory - describes the condition the authors were in when writing their cards

Util - love it!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (do i need more exclamation marks)

Util - Amazing i can't describe how great it is (notice i put a specific section for util and one for kant!)
I love plans, disads, cp debate but also love good topicality debates.

Tricks - debated four years and still don't understand burden structures so let's stay away from that unless you're good at explaining

Brackets - :'( i'll live

Evidence: please weigh between pieces of evidence! please also do not read evidence that isn't comprehendible in normal english (aka anything by kant)

Amidst all the kant hate, I will evaluate it if it makes sense and you actually explain the offense and why it's not circular or why the ends don't matter.

Speaks:
29.5 - you're gonna bid
29 - you should clear
28.5 - middle of the pack


stuff to get extra speaks
- crack a funny joke!
- don't make me evaluate kant
- if you own a s'well water bottle and drink from it! (protect the environment no plastic bottles woo)
- win the round easily
- don't muddle up the round
- clear explanations of arguments
- clear spreading
- start the round on time
- don't be rude to your opponents
- disclose your past positions if you're not a new debater/reading new args
