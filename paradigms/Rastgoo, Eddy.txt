Longer Version

About me
Hi my name is Eddy Rastgoo and I am a freshman at GW. Please just call me Eddy and not "judge" and don't be scared to ask me any questions. I read many arguments when I debated, from race ks to impact turns, so I am familiar with pretty much everything and I am open to whatever you want to read, unless explicitly mentioned below (like bad theory). If you are wondering who I am, I am a short Persian dude who always has a hat. Good luck!

DA/CP
You can read any and every DA and CP that you like, I really like the substance debate, I will vote on every DA/CP doesn't matter how outrageous they sound (I read a Radiation Good DA my senior year) just make sure u link
I actually think that PICs are very strategic so run them, but also believe that they can lose on PICs bad theory if you don't cover their theory arguments well enough

Kritiks
I know the most and am most read on Race (from Lat Crit to Afro pessimism) and Cap/Neolib and am somewhat knowledgeable on Fem ks, however I will admit I am probably not the best judge for you if you are reading Kritiks other than those listed above, simply because I don’t know much about the literature.
I have read a lot about neolib/cap and race arguments and have actively researched these topics for a few years now and I feel very comfortable voting for these kind of arguments.
If you cannot explain your Alternative, don't read the Kritik (this is my rule of thumb)

Theory
I am ok with you reading theory (although I am not the biggest fan of shifting through the theory debate) but I will never vote on frivolous theory (if you are wondering what I consider “Frivolous” please refer to Tim Alderete’s “Bad Theory” list on his paradigm)
Topicality – You can read any topicality argument u feel like
RVI’s – If you respond to an RVI with “RVI’s are stupid, don’t vote for it” I will not vote for the RVI, but if you do not respond to the RVI at all and they extend it, I have no choice but to vote for it, please don’t make me do that
I default to competing interps

Impact Turns
Run these - I love impact turns 
I will even reward you with extra speaker points

Speaker Points
If you are a bad speaker I will give you less than 28.5, if you are meh probably something around 28.5, if you are a good speaker I will give you above a 28.5 and if you're a great speaker I will give you above a 29
I am ok with any sort of speed, go as fast as you want
I will say clear 3 times if you are unclear

These following things will get you extra speaker points:
-Clarity
-Bring me some sort of food (Most popular and effective method)
-Bring me lemonade (Second most popular and effective method)
-Wear Lakers gear (or somehow prove that you are a Lakers fan)
-Give me your flow at the end of the round (If its good I will give you extra points)
-Don't be a dick :)
