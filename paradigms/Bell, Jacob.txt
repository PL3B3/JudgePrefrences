  Education:
Midway High School 2011-2015 - I debated for four years in High School, on the incredibly tiny UIL circuit in Texas, the TFA circuit in Texas, and the national circuit. I was in three bid rounds and got 10th place at NSDA nationals.
TAMU - 2015-2017
UT - 2017-2019

Actual Philosophy:

(I feel bad that I actually need to include this):
1. Cognito Ergo Sum
2. Arguments must be falsifiable, and the burden of proof lies with the person making the argument.


I like arguments. I like teams that don't shy away from actually engaging their opponents. I like arguments that question the staleness of debate, be it policy or critical leaning.

I am plagued by my own identity and the predispositions that come with it. I try to actively avoid letting it impact how I judge debates. I truly believe that debate is a product of the ideas of the teams present. I judge the debate based on these ideas. Debates are organic. Every debate is unique. My job is to discern the validity of the ideas presented, not to utilize my own understanding of your arguments.

I think debate should be a safe space to share ideas and to have fun. Don't take yourself too seriously. Have fun, and remember that we're all different, and think about the world differently. You do you. If you rock the politics DA and case defense, go for it. If you rock the Cthulhu mythos anthropomorphism aff, go for it. No one form of debate is "better", or "right". Do what you do best, and have fun doing it.
