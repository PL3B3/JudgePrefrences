  I competed for 2 1/2 years in high school at G. C. Scarborough high school in Houston, Texas. Since graduating high school, I competed for a year at the University of Houston and I have been judging for 2 years.

I tend to be very open when judging a debate, however, there are a few guidelines that I ask all CX debaters to follow:

I love COUNTERPLANS, but please make sure it is well constructed. All EVIDENCE should be well cited and must be presented when asked by your opponent. No copy equals no evidence. I don't usually vote for TOPICALITY arguments. Don't turn to a T argument as an easy way to win the round...unless your opponent is clearly off topic somewhere in their case. SPREADING is allowed. However, if I or your opponents cannot understand you, then you need to slow down. I will make an attempt to signal you when this happens. If you decide to ignore the signal, IT WILL effect your case. Remember: quality over quantity. DISADS are great and the link story is very critical in the 1NC.

As usual, do not introduce new arguments in the rebuttal. You don't have to like each other but you must be respectful. PLEASE HAVE A WELL ORGANIZED CASE.
