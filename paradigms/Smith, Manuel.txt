  I graduated from Valley High School in 2016. At Valley I did LD debate for 1 1/2 years and public forum debate for 3 years. I qualified to nationals (and cleared) in PF, as well as advancing to elimination rounds at state and at several tournaments throughout my career. 

I evaluate rounds based on the flow. If you have more specific questions, feel free to ask.
