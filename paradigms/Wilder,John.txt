Years judging: 4+
Rounds judged per year: 60-70

How I'll decide the round: I will be flowing the round, listening for the points, drops, claims about drops, turns etc. At the end I'll review my flow to see what's in play, and work from the top down, i.e. who's winning the value, then the criterion, and then the individual contentions. Ideally, someone will give a great summary at the end that matches my flow and explains why they are winning the round. In that case the decision is easy. Otherwise I have to weigh and construct a rational for who won.

What I like
A substantive debate on the resolution itself, including solid reasoning and argumentation backed up where needed with evidence.Responses that explain why you are right and your opponent is wrong.Signposting so I can get things right on the flow
What I don't like
Arguing the trees and missing the forest - the details need to matter.Theory arguments on why your opponent is being abusive. Usually they aren't.
What I'm OK with
Arguing the ground/interpretation of the resolution - that's part of the debate.A priori's - as long as you can explain why they are a prioriOff cases and other unusual case structures - no problem, I'll listen.
Speaking style - A persuasive speaking style is not going to win the round, but good speaking will make you arguments easier to understand and it does play a major role in speaker points.

Speed/spreading - I get writers cramp and I stop flowing. If I don't flow a point, this is bad for you.
