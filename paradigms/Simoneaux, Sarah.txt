  Experience:

Currently, I am a PF coach for Dominican high school in New Orleans, LA. I coached novices and judged LD primarily on the local Louisiana circuit for Jesuit High School in New Orleans.

I am a traditional judge, but I am familiar with "trendy" arguments, having judged VLD at a few national tournaments, but this in no way means that I should be treated as a stock "flow judge." A few issues:

I am HUGE on standards/value criterions. Present me with one, win it, and link your arguments back to it. It needs to be made clear what the standard for the round ends up being and ALL arguments must link back to it for me to consider them.

I am NOT ok with crazy critical advocacy/kritik stuff. I will NOT vote on them, so don't run them in front of me.

Theory is generally OK, but I view theory as a defensive issue, a reason to reject your opponent's argument not an offensive reason to vote for you.

I'm cool with counterplans and stuff as long as they're clear and link to some standard, this means not just assuming some standard of like "consequentialism" and expecting me to create some standard and then link your arguments there for you.

Finally, and this is big, varsity speed is NOT Ok. I can handle some speed, but only like JVLD speed, not VLD. If you speed through your case at VLD speed, I won't understand you, and you'll probably lose the debate.

Ask me any questions before the round to clarify any issues if need be.
