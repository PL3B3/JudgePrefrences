Policy Debater for PCDS high school from 03-07. Have judged HS debate since then at least 2 times a year, including AZ out-rounds. I'm not that familiar with this years Resolution, however.

Spreading is fine, I can flow, don't worry, I'm not a lay judge.

I will pull the trigger on T and Theory. T is actually one of my more favorite arguments.

I debated the K in high school a lot. Dunno if that makes me more or less likely to like your K args. I do know that I often need a framework debate to vote for a K.

I sometimes ask for cards after the round. I give oral RFDs.
