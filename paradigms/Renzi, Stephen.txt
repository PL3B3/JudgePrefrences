I do not have many preconceived ideas on current LD practices or arguments because I am largely unfamiliar with them. Explain your argument and give me reasons to prefer your side of the resolution. Speed is fine, do your best to be clear where arguments are being made on the flow.


When considering theory I look for in-round abuse. Without that I will easily vote on cross-x checks, no voters, reject the argument not the debater and try to decide the round elsewhere.


Have fun, be respectful of one another and ask questions before the round.
