Award-winning Author
I earned a master’s in international relations and diplomacy from Schiller International University, Paris, France and a bachelor’s in political science from the University of Rochester. I’ve held high-level managerial positions with international organizations overseeing food security, child protection, health, and education programs in Africa and Haiti. I have put my career on hold to devote my time to raising my two children, and will soon publish the second children’s book from my Africa series. 
I am a parent judge, and this is my first year judging high school debates. I view debating as an important and essential tool for self-improvement and expression.
Philosophy for debates:
I will evaluate how well the debater has researched the topic, and organized and presented contentions in a clear and succinct manner. Please be mindful of the following:
Adequate research is key to presenting an effective argument. Please conduct thorough research prior to the tournament.Stay on topic and do not introduce unrelated material which will negatively impact the delivery of contentions.Keep time. It pains me when a debater goes beyond the allotted time for each activity.Don’t spread, and please deliver articulate and concise arguments.Please remain professional and respectful of counter positions. I abhor pettiness and detest demeaning personal attacks.
