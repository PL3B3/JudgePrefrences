During the round I flow all the arguments I am able. I critically listen to all arguments; however, I want the debaters to tell me what matters in the round.

Speed: This is fine as long as you aren’t distracting in your style and you don’t blur all the words together.

Framework: This is quite important to me since it gives me a fair standard with which to evaluate the round. It is important that I am given some weighing mechanism to evaluate the arguments.

Warrants: All arguments must have warrants. Additionally, it is important for an opposer to point out lack of warrants.

Weighing/Voters: The debaters should be able to weigh the arguments presented in the round and impact them back to their standards. Debaters should be able to pick out the most important issues at the end of the round and tell me why I should look to them over others.
