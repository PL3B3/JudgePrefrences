  I prefer a few well developed, well supported arguments that are designed to genuinely sway my opinion towards your stance on the resolution over many technical, flimsy arguments that are designed to tally up more points on your side of the flow. An argument is more compelling if it is presented with proper composure at a reasonable speed. In other words-- this is an oral exercise in persuasion-- not just what you say, but how you say it matters. Quality over quantity. I generally find kritiks and avoidances of the societal context of a resolution to be easy copouts and generally hold that type of argument against the debater. Finally, please don't tell me 'he can't do this, don't let her do that, I win because of this, she loses because of that'-- just make your own arguments and counter your opponent's arguments.

I am a parent judge for Hunter College High School and have judged at 7 major tournaments over the past few years.
