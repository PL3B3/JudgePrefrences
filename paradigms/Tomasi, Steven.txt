  Short Version: If you debate like Adam, do not pref me very high.

Long Version

I'm a traditional judge. That means I'm highly unlikely to vote strictly on the flow. Just because Aff dropped the #2 on the standard doesn't mean I give it any more credence than a better explained and more persuasive argument. I'm also not super experienced with the activity (I never debated in high school or college; my first experience with it was judging Novice LD in 2011) so if you ask me hyper-specific questions about my RFD after the round I might not have a definite answer.

No speed, tricks, or lots of jargon (I'm still getting used to terms like "PIC" or "kritik"). Also, just because Adam runs util does not mean that I'll hack for it. You can run it in front of me, but I won't hack for it.
