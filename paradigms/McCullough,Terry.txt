My general philosophy is to reward thoroughness, clarity of argument and especially support of argument with specific source and DATE references. I frown upon multiple references to personal opinion unsubstantiated by facts.

Well organized speeches include introductions that greet the members of the chamber, clearly state whether the speaker is arguing in the affirmative or in negation and a summary of how the speaker would like the members of the student congress to vote. In either the introductory remarks or summary remarks there should be a brief listing of key supporting facts.

Clear diction is important, as is comfort level in the chamber.
