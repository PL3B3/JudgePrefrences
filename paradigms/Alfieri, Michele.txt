  Iâ€™m a parent judge from Harrison New York and I am new to debate. 
General: I will do my best to listen to and flow your arguments but I do have a hearing disorder so please go as slow as possible and be clear. Please time yourselves.

I don't like and won't understand most debate jargon. I will vote for the debater who has the best arguments, tells me why they win and which arguments are most important. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask me before the round.
