I did LD in high school and was on the forensics/debate team all four years and led it as a senior. As a judge, I really appreciate creativity. Also, debaters ought to be able to communicate effectively because it is quality, not quantity of evidence, that counts, so please, please do not speed through a round. As a philosophy junkie, debaters who use philosophy in LD have a slight advantage because they can draw in theory in addition to the real world. Evidence is also powerful and important, especially when making general assertions. In general, I like a traditional, clear argumentative development. It's all about the flow, and I dislike a huge pile of loosely connected information for me to digest and interpret.
