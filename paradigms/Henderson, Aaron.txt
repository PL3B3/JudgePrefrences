  I am a parent judge and have been judging for 3 years (as of Jan 2011). I have worked in the computer/software industry my adult life and understand how to sell things and enjoy the logic inherent in all activites. So, I am looking for the best argument with solid backing. I understand the LD process - if the competitor doesn't refute I win the point - and yet will not give credit for points that don't have logical, be it philisophical, support.

Given I am a parent judge and was not involved in Speech and Debate in High School, I don't speak the LD lingo fluently. I understand the different styles and approaches, but can get lost in jargon. I do flow every debate. I follow the Value, VC, Contention format the easiest.

I have gotten much better at following quickly spoken cases, but cannot follow spreads well. It is better to use a couple strong VC's than to try to overwhelm me with quantity. If I can't follow, I won't give credit.
