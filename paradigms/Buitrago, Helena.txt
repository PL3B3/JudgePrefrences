Things you should know if I’m your judge:
I’m willing to vote on both “policy” and “critical” considerations. Make sure the kritik is not generic and applies to the specific advantages of the plan.Debates should be heaviest at the link level— explain to me why you get to access your impacts. I know nuclear war is bad, but it doesn’t help me if both teams are claiming to prevent it. I need a clear analysis explaining why your evidence is better or your scenario for war is more probable. I adamantly believe topicality is a voting issue. I think it is the burden of the neg to prove the aff is unreasonable—preferably do this in terms of limits. That being said, I am also willing to vote on “our counter-interpretation is a bit better.”Theory: To win on theory, you need to persuade me to “reject the argument and the team.” I am not easily persuaded by claims that PICS and conditionality are bad. I also give the aff quite a bit of leeway on perm arguments and am unlikely to vote on severance or intrinsicness. I’ll flow all speeches and likely call for evidence after the round. In terms of evidence comparison, warrants and qualifications are important; use them to your advantage. I also give weight to well-reasoned analytical arguments.
