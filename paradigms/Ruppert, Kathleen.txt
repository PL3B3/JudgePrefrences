  I am a 2nd-year coach in a fairly traditional LD program. Speed is not a problem, unless it interferes with clarity. I tend to keep a rigorous flow, but still expect debaters to crystallize and present voting issues -- The more you can crystallize, the happier you will be with my decision. I expect cases to be thoroughly researched, but please do not just rattle off cards without impacting them. Clear sign-posting is appreciated and weighing is a must.
