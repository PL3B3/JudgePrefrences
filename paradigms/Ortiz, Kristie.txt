Hi! I enjoy well-structured and insightful speeches. More importantly, tell me why it matters.

I competed in several tournaments for Rancho Bernardo and I continue to study light debate theory today.

Spread if you will. I will yell "clear" if need be. If you are going to run Ks or theory, make it clear.

Speaker points:
✓ Organization
✓ Engage your audience
✓ Keep it cordial

x Lack of impact analysis
x Being non-topical

Thanks for reading. Enjoy!
