  I have no formal debate training. I’ve never debated. I’ve been an English teacher in the NYC Department of Education for sixteen years and a high school speech and debate coordinator for six. I’ve judged in the BQCFL, the NYSFL State Championship, the NYSDCA State Championship, the NCFL Grand Nationals as well as some national circuit tournaments such as Yale, the NYC Invitational, Princeton, UPenn, Bump, and Scarsdale. 

I prefer what would I’m sure be termed “traditional” rounds. I am not the best person to judge rounds with spreading, theory, off-cases, and jargon. To put it another way, if you like to be judged by former policy debaters, then I’m not your man. I don’t plan to vote against these methods on principle, but as someone from outside the “debate camp” culture, it is quite hard for me to understand the language use developing in that culture.
