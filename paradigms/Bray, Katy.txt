  Tabula Rasa - I go into a debate round as a blank slate. Each team will need to use reason, logic, and critical thinking to win my vote. I value strong arguments comprised of recent events, theories, statistics, ect. I look for drops and holes in argumentation. Good communication skills and organization is equally important.
