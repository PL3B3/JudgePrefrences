What do you think the Aff burdens should be?
The aff must prove their case to be topical, and to have significant advantages over the status quo.

What do you think the Neg burdens should be?
The negative must prove why the affirmative is not a solid policy option, or why it should be rejected. They must apply their arguments as specifically to the case as possible.

How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)?
I prefer quick, rather than fast, although I am comfortable with either. Please punch tags.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks?
I feel generic Disads should have as specific links as possible, and the links should be explained well. CPs are a great negative strategy, but I will listen to CP theory. On Kritiks I generally don’t know the literature very well, so explain your links, impact, and your alternative.

How I feel about case debates?
A good case debate is fantastic to judge. Please make your case attacks as specific as possible, and explain the story.

Other Comments/Suggestions:**
PLEASE tell me why you win and weigh the round. I prefer good analysis of evidence rather than a massive flood of evidence. Impact calculus needs to be well done. I prefer not to vote on theory unless there is in round abuse. (I feel this happens on most abusive strategies). On Topicality, please keep the line-by-line clean. I err aff on topicality, so explain the violation and ground lost well.
