  I debated for four years at Strake Jesuit, debating primarily on the national circuit.

I'll vote on anything so long as it is warranted and not repugnant. That being said, I've probably been influenced by how I debated as a debater. I mostly read theory and framework/philosophy by my senior year, but I also read some LARPish stuff, just not extensively. I read some Ks and post modern stuff from time to time, but I am probably not the person you want in the back of the room if you are going to read some high theory position. If you have any questions, feel free to ask since this probably isn't a satisfactory paradigm, but oh well.

Speaks are a reflection of argument quality and strategy.
