  A quick background. I was a high school policy debater at Wheeler High School. I have broken at National Tournaments in Varsity.

I am fine with all types of arguments.
DA: Offense is much better than defense. Link Turn and Non-unique the disad instead of just running impact defense. Also, it is surprising how many teams run really dumb disads. If you think the Disad is terrible, just explain your analytics.
CP: You must explain solvency well. Explain the Perm and how it solves.
K: Contextualize your kritik alternative. Do work on how it works with the aff.
Theory: I usually lean towards the neg on condo, but there are many strategic way to read condo. Extending Condo briefly in the 1ar can put the 2nr in a tough spot, but don't do this unless you know you can properly invest enough time into everything else.
T: I love a good T debate.

Misc:
You need to flow. Flowing is usually the difference between good debaters and bad.
Try not to answer stuff from line by line in the Overview. Doing good line by line will vastly increase your speaks.
As always, clarity > speed.
I buy explained analytics as equivalent to cards but only if they are logical and properly explained.
Why does everyone except me to time everything? Yall should time all your own speeches and prep time. (speech times are a construct anyways right????)
DO NOT STEAL PREP! If a timer is not running, you should not be prepping.

Everyone keeps asking me if I take prep for flashing. The answer is no unless you're slow.
