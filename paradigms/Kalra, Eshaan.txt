Nontraditional: "I strongly believe that the affirmative must defend they hypothetical implementation of a topical plan by the United States federal government. It will be excruciatingly difficult to convince me otherwise and a mildly competent extension of framework will be sufficient for me to vote against a non-traditional affirmative. 
Translation: Strike me"- Michael Wimsatt 


Overview
Be RespectfulTech > TruthJokes are appreciated, especially ones related to sports.I wont take prep for flashing unless it becomes a problem – we all know how to work flash drives and emails Don’t steal prep, I will be watching youPlease flow Evidence comparison is highly encouraged. CLARITY > SPEED!!!!Please be clear. If you are unclear and I can't understand your argument, that argument does not exist in the debate. Clipping = L and 0 SpeaksDebate is really fun. Enjoy!

Impact Calc/Framing­- 
This is the most important to me. Tell me how I should look at the debate after the round is over. This is especially true with the last rebuttals (but should be started earlier). You need to explain the impact and compare it with other impacts. Along with these come framing issues on how I should look at the overall debate. This needs to be explained because the last thing I wanna hear is “Look at the UQ debate through the lens of PC” and no explanation. These framing issues also need to be answered and compared- these are the best debates to judge. 


DA
- I love disads sooooooo much!
- If politics/elections isn’t in the 1NC you're doing it wrong.
- Impact calc is important as explained above. Impact calc that turns the internal link of the other impact are the best. So generic turns the case like “oh war turns the environment because of nuclear war” is not a good turns case analysis.
- Uniqueness from the last decade is greatly appreciated.
- If one of your “DA” authors is named Baudrillard just sit down. You’d get higher speaker points in front of me sitting down than finishing that 1NC.

T
- I love T debates – make sure you explain why the negative/affirmative vision of debate is bad and vice versa. I think you should do evidence comparison on whose interp is best. I default to competing interpretations unless told to do otherwise.
- I would much rather see impacts on T that are outside a debate round – so fairness and education is good and all but explain how it affects debaters outside of rounds, AKA advocacy skills, creativity etc.
- usually default to reasonability 

K
- I have not read as much into K literature so I am not as familiar with some arguments. I REALLY do like some K’s such as neolib and security but if you are those one off Death K’s or K’s that make me rethink my existence I am not the best judge for you.
- These also have implications- link debate is hella important like most other judges- CONTEXTUALIZE IT TO THE AFF- I hate K debates that are general

CP
- Yes please...
- make sure they are competitive
- “If I hear judge kick one more time I'm gonna judge kick you in the face” – Andrea Reed.


Theory

- Pretty neutral on conditionality, 2 condo is pretty standard. Don’t really mind if they contradict either as long as the neg doesn’t make the cross applications that the aff says.

- Most of the time it’s a reason to reject the arg.


Case
- Love this so much. Do some research and make it specific. NOTHING and I repeat NOTHING is better when you embarrass the aff team in CX, because YOU did research on THEIR aff.

*Please don’t be the team that just reads impact D- specific 1AC indicts and internal link defense will be rewarded BUT I do think that impact D is important in the 2NC so the aff cant just claim try or die.
