  I judge from a solely objective perspective. I decide rounds, only based on arguments and debates related to the topic of discussion. 

I will not entertain any separate issues, theories, or off-case positions. 

I mainly judge speech events; however, I am very well aware of the rules and regulations of formal debate. 
That being said, participants will be judged on their accuracy and their establishment of well thought out, factual arguments. 

I will not answer any questions regarding score or effectiveness of argument after the round is done.


All critiques and comments will be left on the ballot.
