  I have judged LD for six years in California's Central Valley, and throughout my experience I find that I vote for those debaters who persuade by using credible evidence, analyse their opponents argument critically, and explain through clear communication why they should win. I favor those who employ professional courtesy and make good use of their time. I admire those debaters who truly engage in the clash, and are willing to delve into the complexity of the issue.


I will warn you if you are not clear.



I am not a fan of empty arguments and hot air sales pitches.
