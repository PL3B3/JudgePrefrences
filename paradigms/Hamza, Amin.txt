  Spreading is ok with me, but clarity is the most important factor. If you can't spread with great clarity, slow down. It will be reflected in speaker points as well as the number of arguments I am able to flow.
I love a great framework debate, but debate whatever makes you comfortable.
Kritiks are cool, I'm familiar with most of the literature, but there is no reason you should not clash and present well warranted arguments.
Be decent and polite.
