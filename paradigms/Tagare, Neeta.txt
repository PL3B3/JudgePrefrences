  I am a parent judge. I have judged in the local CFL league for 3 years but am only accustomed to slow debate. This means NO SPREADING. If I can't understand you, I won't listen to your arguments. I am okay with policy style arguments such as plans, counterplans, disadvantages, etc... however refrain from using debate jargon because I may not understand. The key for me is crystallization in the rebuttals. If you persuade me that your side is true, I will give you the ballot.
