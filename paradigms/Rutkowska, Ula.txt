  I debated for Georgetown Day in high school, I go to Brandeis now.
Debate how you want. I will be neutral in my evaluation of every argument. Don't be mean.
I will list some of the things that I think below:
don't make silly theory/framework arguments.
i generally think that states and international cp's are good for debate
i am not the biggest fan of the aff making framework arguments against the k
explain the k/don't just read a ton of cards and expect me to do all the analysis for you. please know what you are talking about (this applies to everything)
if you're negative, then try to have a good link story for the k
i generally view topicality in terms of limits
