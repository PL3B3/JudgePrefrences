UCLA '20, studying philosophy and economics

When it comes to judging, I do not favor any argument over another. Run whatever arguments you want to run. Warrant and impact with your claims â€” tell me why you think this argument should win you the round.

For reference, was primarily a kritikal and theory debater in high school. I read a lot of Lacan, Agamben, and Coloniality. Most of my 2NRs were on the K or on theory.
