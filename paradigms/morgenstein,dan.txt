  I'VE JUDGED PUBLIC FORUM, LD , AND CONGRESS, AND MY PHILOSOPHY IS CLEAR AND CONCISE ARGUMENTS, NO SPREADING, AND FOR THE VALUE TO BE THE CENTRAL PART OF THE CASE. TRADITIONL ARGUMENTS TRANSLATE BEST WITH ME, BUT IF YOU'RE USING THEORY MAKE SURE YOU GIVE A THOROUGH EXPLANATION OF HOW ITS BEING USED AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING IT CORRECTLY.
I LISTEN TO REBUTTALS , AND I'M LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY OF INFORMATION AND ARGUMENTS ACROSS THE FLOW.
PERSONAL BELIEFS SHOULD NOT OVERCOME THE CASE, FRAME YOUR CASE BASED ON THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO ARGUE YOUR POINTS. BE RESPECTFUL AND COURTEOUS TO YOUR OPPONENT.
I VOTE BASED ON CONFIDENCE, PRESENTATION, AND PROPER USE OF INFORMATION, AND YOUR ABILITY TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU HAVE UPHELD YOUR VALUE AND WON THE ARGUMENTS.
