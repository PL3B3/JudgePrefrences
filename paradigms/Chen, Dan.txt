  I debated for 4 years for Whippany Park High School in New Jersey on the national circuit.

Speed: I'm fine with speed but clarity is also important. If you're being unclear, I'll yell clear a couple times before docking speaks. Most likely, if you're going too fast or are too unclear, you'll be able to tell because I'll stop flowing. 

Theory/T: Theory is fine but make sure your theory arguments are clear and warranted (preferably in a shell). I don't like unnecessary theory but will vote on it if it is warranted. Bear in mind if it's unnecessary, it won't take a lot to beat it back. 

Extension: You should extend the claim, warrant, and impact in some form. You don't need to repeat every word but don't simply say "extend x".

Kritiks; I'm not very familiar with Ks so run them at your risk. I'm not predisposed in anyway toward Ks but I might misunderstand some parts of it.

Critical arguments: Again, I'm not very familiar with many of these critical authors so if you want me to vote on them, make sure they are explained clearly in case. 

General:

I default to the standard in terms of weighing the round. Any a prioris/off cases that are prestandards must be clearly warranted as such (keep in mind my threshold for aprioris is pretty high because they're abusive most of the time). Offensive and defensive arguments must also be labeled as such. Any offensive arguments on your opponents case should be labeled as a turn or offensive in some way. Signposting is also extremely important. If you're signposting is unclear I won't follow your arguments and you might lose speaks.
