  I am new to judging as I have only been judging high school for about a year. I come from a science background that highly informs my decision making when judging debate. Logic and evidence are key.

To be brief:

1. Logic
Logic and evidence tend to be of paramount importance to me. I can’t stand logical fallacies. You will quickly lose my confidence and your credibility if you use them. This is especially true of using slippery slopes in disads. I don’t buy them. You need to make clear, credible, easily believable links if you are going to go there. I am also impressed when someone calls their opponent out on a logical fallacy. It drives me crazy when someone uses a logical fallacy to make their argument and the opposing side lets it stand.

2. Evidence
I appreciate recent, well vetted evidence.

3. Speed
My ear for speed is not as well developed as many. If I can’t understand or follow you, I can’t fairly judge your argument. I don’t feel speed is necessary to win. A single, well vetted argument based on really sound evidence and use of excellent logic will beat a less valid argument that has a ton of shaky evidence spewed out fast enough to make a listener dizzy. Talking quickly is fine, spreading is tough for me to follow. Quality over quantity.

4. Civility
Maintain civility at all times. Do not be rude to your opponent. You can be tough and hard-hitting without being mean. Resorting to incivility does not damage your opponent’s credibility, it damages yours.

5. Topicality
It’s important. Again, it goes back to my emphasis on logic. If I don’t logically buy the topicality, I’m not buying much of anything that follows.
