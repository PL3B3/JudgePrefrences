What you need to know about me:
- Do not spread technical jargon
- I will only vote for arguments I can understand and you should only read arguments that you understand too
- I do not vote for arguments that do not have warrants even if they are extended
- Don't ask me how to get a 30
- Do not label things as turns when they are not
- I don't like tricks or theory and will most likely get bored if you read it

Have fun!
