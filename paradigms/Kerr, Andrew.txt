I debated policy for three years at Reno High School(04-07). I am now a coach at Peoria Notre Dame High School. I am a Stock Issues judge. I like T, DA’s, CPs, and on case arguments. I am not a philosophy buff, so please no K. That is not to say I wont vote for a K, but if I don’t understand your K I will not vote for it. Good Luck!
