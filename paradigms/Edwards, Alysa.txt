I did 4 years of policy in high school for Juan Diego but no longer debate. I now assistant coach debate for Juan Diego.

I was primarily a policy team- I like CPs and DAs a lot. All the same, I still read Ks and will definitely vote on them, just explain yourself well. I'm not familiar with specific K literature. What arguments I vote on are not limited to the ones I like- feel free to read what you want but be prepared to explain it. I want to hear impact analysis and comparison- make it very clear how and what you are winning. Don't just assume I know the thesis of your argument. I also think debates on evidence are valuable so have warrants and if the other team is power tagging, point it out.

Flashing is not prep but please flash all the evidence you plan on reading when the other team asks. Make sure your mark where you stopped reading as well.
