  About me:
If I debated in this current era I would be a framework debater.
I do this activity because I love the strategy and critical thinking involved and enjoy being able to give back to the community. I have not read every piece of critical literature that you have read to write your arguments. I have competed and judged for a combined +13 years.
Communicating:
I am not a cranky old person telling you to slow down. I do however think it is worth reminding most debaters that I am (oftentimes) not looking directly at your evidence as you read it which means that varying tone/speed on tags is necessary. Since the transition to a paperless debate era the visual cues are virtually gone and we are now exclusively an auditory experience. Only be rude if you can back it up.
What I aim for:
I believe that the debaters ultimately frame the debate round. I will default to a policy maker/utilitarian if no one tells me otherwise. Overall, I aim to evaluate the round as close to the flow as possible.
Biases:
Debate is a game; create your own rules. However, ensure that they provide competitive fairness to both teams. I believe the alternative needs to (exist, and) be argued well in order for the kritik to be a legitimate position. I also firmly believe that the K needs to provide a fair division of ground for the opposing team to argue - you need to persuade me your alternative is what I should vote for, not simply that the plan is what I shouldn't.
Things I like:
Make signing my ballot very clear and easy; take the easy way out. Creative topicality violations. Uphold competitive equity.
