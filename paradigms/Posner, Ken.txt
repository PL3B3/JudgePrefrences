  I enjoy judging Lincoln-Douglas debates. I have been introduced to LD in a traditional manner, however, I am intellectually interested in more progressive styles of debate. I am capable of comprehending advanced level argumentation, but the specific links of the arguments need to be communicated coherently. Additionally, please take time to explain the layers of the debate, the interaction of arguments, and weigh specific impacts. Please specify your voting issues. I will evaluate any argument as long as it is clearly articulated and a decision calculus is explained. I am comfortable with speed, but prefer measured argumentation over stentorian celerity. Please ask any questions you have before the round begins. I look forward to judging.
