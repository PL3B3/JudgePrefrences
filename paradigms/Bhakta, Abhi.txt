  I'm fine with generally anything you want to run. I'm not as up on my k literature as I used to be, so you might want to ask some questions before you run the new one. Speed is fine, but you have to be clear, and I'll let you know if you aren't. Again, I don't have many argument specific predispositions, as long as I understand what you're trying to do. If you have a specific question about arguments, just ask.
