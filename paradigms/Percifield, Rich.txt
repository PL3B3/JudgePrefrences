  I am very much a flow judge. I qualified for CX Nationals in 1980. I did debate the National circuit 1978-1980. I am a very issues-oriented judge, though am open-minded to new types of debates. I have limited exposure to K debating but am open to considering this type of argument. I don't mind speed as long as it is understandable and as long as their is some level of persuasiveness.
