I haven't attended school in a LONG time :-)
I coach, so I judge a lot of rounds
29 years judging experience


Topicality - If it reasonable -- If the case is CLEARLY topical, don't bother running it!
The Kritik - I think this is an absolutely ridiculous position. I understand it, but if you want to debate rhetoric, make an event to do it. That being said, however, if it is run, I have to consider the arguments in the round. My preference would be don't run it.
Performance -- Again - silly argument - don't waste your time. Same comment as above though with regard to if it is in the round, I have to consider it.
Counterplan theory -- Same philosophy as Topicality -- If the Counterplan is a reasonable response to the Aff, then it should be run. I lean toward traditional CP theory.
No "favorite" arguments, but I would like to hear specifics over generics.

LD preferences -- Please have a value! :-) Pragmatic arguments are fine as long as they link to the philosophical. Don't drag bad policy arguments into LD. I am a pretty traditional LD judge.
