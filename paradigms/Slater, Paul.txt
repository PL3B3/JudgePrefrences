  I am a lover of human debate. I can hardly understand spread. If you talk to me quickly though, like any human being, I'll understand you.

I'd like to hear about space because space is cool. If at all possible, stay on that. The same goes for topicality. Don't bore me.

I can't flow too well, but if you speak like a normal human being you'll be fine.

As the great philosophers Bill S. Preston and "Ted" Theodore Logan say, "be excellent to each other."
