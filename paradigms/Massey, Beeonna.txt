  For starts my name is actually Breonna Massey. I am a former high school debater. I debated for Baltimore Polytechnic Institute where I debated for three years. I am currently attending University of Maryland, studying a government and politics. I think the debate round should come down to arguments that are the most pragmatic. I feel like debate should challenge norms thus I prefer for there to be a little petty arguments as possible but instead I think the big picture should be drawn in order for me to evaluate the debate round. I hate speed reading. I think that speed reading does nothing for education and unless you are planning on being an auctioneer there is no use for it outside of the debate space. I do give harsh criticism that will help debaters improve. At the end of the day I want debate to be a fun learning environment.
