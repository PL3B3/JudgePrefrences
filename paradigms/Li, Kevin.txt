Some people that have influenced me in debate: Lee Thach, Rashad Evans. Look in their philosophies for things I’d probably agree with. I read an Asian identity aff for my last 2 years of high school, and went for anti blackness arguments in ~80% of neg rounds. That said, I’ll vote for most things if you’re winning the reason why I should vote for it. 


T
I evaluate it almost like a disad so you should be creating impact scenarios beyond words like “fairness” or “education.” 


Theory
If you’re going for theory, it should probably be the only argument in your last speech. Explain in depth what each of your impacts mean, and what actually voting for that argument means. I also think the reject the arg, not the team argument is very persuasive, so if you’re trying to win theory, explain why rejecting the team is necessary

DA/CP
Not much to say here, disad debates are usually pretty straight forward. Well impacted disads as net benefits to counterplans are good. Impact framing is also good. I like PICs, but be careful with theory debates if you’re reading more than one. 


Kritiks:
A large part of my debate experience has involved critical arguments, but I won’t say I’m well versed philosophy or critical theory. I know some things about identity arguments but not very much about Heidegger, so it’s best to take the time and explain what you’re trying to say. 


K Affs
I think as far as I’m concerned, there’s no resolution until the 1NC reads T. Make sure you have justifications for what you are doing, and focus on the meta level framing, impact calculations, and what your aff actually does. 

FW vs K affs:
I don’t really like FW args that demand an “instrumental implementation of a policy action” by the aff, but I like nuanced framework arguments or disads that discusses how critical arguments function within a debate sphere
