  Debate experience: I debated for Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for four years in high school. Nearly all the tournaments I attended were on the South Dakota circuit, which lends itself to a more traditional style of debate. Currently, I am an assistant coach for Rapid City Stevens High School in South Dakota.

 Paradigm: I consider myself a policymaker, and love to see arguments applied across the flow, to create a more complete view of the round.

 Kritikal args: I don’t have much experience with kritikal arguments, but if you’re able to apply them throughout the debate, in such a way that it becomes the best policy option in the round, then it should be fine.

 Topicality: I’m not the biggest fan of topicality. It shouldn’t be in the 2nr unless there is in-round abuse.

 CPs: I really enjoy strategic cp/disad combos – it’s the best strategy in my opinion. I’m fine with conditional cps. Not the biggest fan of PICs, but I’ll listen to them.

 Everything else: As far as disads, and case arguments, the biggest thing is to just show me how voting for you is the best policy option.

 Note: I have been doing some coaching on this topic, but haven’t judged any rounds this year, as of the Omaha Westside tournament.
