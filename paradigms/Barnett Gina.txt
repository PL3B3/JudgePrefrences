  I coach for Crenshaw High School where I am a teacher. This is my first year judging so I am still very new. You should not speak faster than a conversational pace. While I know the basics of debate, you should err toward explaining your arguments and not assume that I know what your acronyms mean and understand the complexities of your arguments.
