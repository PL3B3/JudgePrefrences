  I debated for two years at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. I was a performance debater and I ran critical
arguments that centered on feminism and white supremacy. While I prefer judging critical debates
because I believe they are more interesting and educational, it should not stop you from running
traditional policy arguments. I will vote for you as long as you tell me how to vote. Just make it clear to
me what I am voting for, if I don’t understand what you want me to vote for, I’m very likely not to vote
for you. I would rather you run what you are comfortable running rather than try to adapt to my
preference and run an argument that you are not comfortable with. Just focus on the analytics of your
argument and explain to me why I should vote for you. I especially need for you to set a framework and
a ROB for the debate round for me to evaluate the arguments under and then you must explain to me
how you meet them and win those in the debate round.
