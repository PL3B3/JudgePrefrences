  I am a lay judge. Very lay. I can understand maybe 90% of what you say if you talk super fast, and will definitely have trouble processing it. Also, I don't like theory. At all. I don't want to hear a debate about the rules of debate. Be clear and persuasive. Even though these debates have moral and ethical frameworks, I like empirical impacts. That's what persuades me most that you should win.

And I know this is not what a lot of you have prepped for, and I am sorry for that. But I will miss a whole lot of what you say if you spread, and the result will be random, and that's no good, either. Thank you
