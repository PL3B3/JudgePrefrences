  I did four years of policy debate in high school at Bellarmine College Prep. I have never judged LD before, but I have experience in circuit policy.

The best ways you can get my ballot are to stay organized, be polite, have fun, and tell me why I should vote for you. In-depth impact calc will also highly increase your chances of winning.

Please stick to the topic -- performance and blatantly non-topical cases are not my cup of tea and will most likely not get my vote. 

Clearly articulate your value, value criterion, and framework and give detailed analysis with as much clash as possible explaining why yours should be preferred. 

I can handle some speed (I competed on the policy circuit for about 2 years), but the slower you go, the less I will miss. Persuasion trumps speed in all cases.

Logistics
Flashing time is not prep time. Please don't abuse this or steal prep, it's just bad.
