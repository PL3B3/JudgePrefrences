  Currently coaching Phillips Academy TC, Westlake EE
Head of Debate at the Collegiate School (NY), 2015-2016

Competed in LD in Arizona for 2 years, in CX at Cornell for 3 years.

I start running your prep if saving a doc takes more than a minute; exceptions allowed for tech. 

The short:
I believe it is for you to decide what types of arguments you enjoy running and find strategic. Generally, I will vote for anything that is extended and contextualized in round. Speed is good. I would ask about my current thresholds for theory, extensions, etc, before that given round. 

Ask me questions any time! I am more than happy to discuss how I view debate or a particular round in more detail. My email is kuo.phb@gmail.com 
Above all else, be nice and have fun. I care a great deal about this activity; please do not be rude. I really enjoy debate and I think you should too!

The long:
How to get better speaker points
 Be strategic in rebuttals--consolidating when possibledon't go for everything in your last speechmake beneficial concessions when possibledon't reach for a new sheet of paper when you can win somewhere elseorganize organize organize30s are for people I think are a model of what debate should and can be in that given round. It's not enough to be good at debate, I think there should be incentive to be good for debate. Here is a useful scale; it is the points scale provided at the 2013 Shirley, with some modification.

T/any theory
 I won't vote off: NSDA rules theory (not the same as an ethics violation)plans bad theory"need an explicit text" interps novices and traditional debaters must disclose interpsI don't buy jurisdiction args. It is inconsistent with my paradigm to believe that I am no more than a W/L allocation machine.I WILL intervene if you run theory against someone who is an obvious local, traditional debater or a newly pulled up novice. (Particularly at the Harvard tournament)I am sympathetic to a "gut-check" on bad theory (if I am in some kind of mood, it may be easier than trying to win reasonability, etc.)idk how I feel about disclosure theory. Historically I have found these debates uncomfortable to judge, particularly because I don't often look at speech docs until after the round. Good interps to run: condo bad; abusive perms bad (severance perms, intrinsic perms, etc);abusive CPs bad (delay CPs, etc); abusive fiat bad (object fiat, multiactor fiat, etc). If I'm being honest, I don't enjoy flowing more than 20 sec worth of spikes/theory pre-empts in the AC; just read a better AC with more substance. "progressive" things
 high threshold for explanations on high theory. don't read model minority.good LARP is good.anything is fine.
Other 
 -I have a bad poker face. My face is very expressive; if this is an issue, just strike me. I've also been told I nod or shake my head a lot or fidget, etc. It just means I'm listening and the wheels in my brain are turning; it doesn't mean I am buying it or that I agree/disagree with it. I really just have a problem with not moving around. I leave the round/room a lot to get water. Again, if any of this makes you uncomfortable, then go ahead and either strike me or let me know very early on. 

-Please don't go for everything in the NR/2AR.

-I have a relatively high threshold for extensions, ask me for any clarification before the round. A conceded argument is not a game over issue, you still have to extend it and do impact analysis. 

-empirics--you can totally read #s in front of me. Just know that I flow it as "#s". I don't care about your #s. Because the #s function as a reason/warrant the claim is true, e.g. "X increases Y". And if someone answers with more #s, it's just defense (not a turn) and doesn't drastically changed what I hear in the round. What does change is if someone says "the method/statistical model for arriving at those #s is flawed", in which case I see that as an indict of the warrant. I always roll my eyes when people start comparing %s and #s (the "his/her study says 60%, but mine says 70%, so if I did my math right, that should be 9348534059245 people"), because you should know, I really do just flow "#'s". 

-Presumption is a silly "argument". If your winning strat is "presume aff/neg", I don't know if you are going to win. I just find it a waste of time, because I only care about presumption if there is nothing to vote on in round. Hint: there is almost always something to vote on. If you must know, my default is presume neg. 

-Do the work to resolve arguments so that I don't have to. This means a lot of weighing. I have so much trouble voting on "independent voters" because, believe it or not, they interact with the rest of the debate. Calling it independent doesn't make it independent from the rest of the reps/performances/args in the round. Just spend another 15 seconds explaining how it relates to the framing of the debate and why it outweighs, instead of focusing on the fact that it is "independent" or conceded. 

-I understand "flex prep" to mean you get to ask questions during your prep time if your opponent wishes to answer them. You can't just jettison your CX in favor of additional prep time, lol.
