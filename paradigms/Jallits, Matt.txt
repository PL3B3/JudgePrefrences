I don’t really care what style of debate you prefer, I’m interested in your ability to defend and advance advocacies of your choosing. The complexity of policy debate is something to be celebrated and all strategies, arguments, and styles are welcome and I will do my best to adapt to you.

Overall, to win my ballot, you need to:

A) Give me a reason to vote for you.

B) Win that your reason is more important than the other teams reason.

Absent A and/or B, I will attempt to logically infer A and/or B as best I can given the debate.

Other tips for debating in front of me:

1) I try not to over-think my decisions. Simplest explanation for why someone wins and/or why someone loses means less intervention on my part.

2) While I appreciate good evidence, it is secondary to what you do with it. Controlling the spin on evidence and argument framing gets you further then robotic extensions and block reading.

3) Direct refutation is easier for me to put together than implied arguments.

4) While I don't flow cross-ex, I'm listening closely. It's my favorite part of a debate and I enjoy watching the direct interaction between debaters.

5) I would prefer to not preside over accusations against others for what they may or may not have done outside of the round I'm judging at that moment.

6) I don’t time flashing speeches. However, poor paperless behaviors will be reflected in speaker points.

Ask me any specific questions before the round and I'll gladly answer them!
