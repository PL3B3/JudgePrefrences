Speed: Speed is not a problem I will be able to flow anything.

Arguments: I will vote on anything and I'm fine with any argument you want to run. 

Theory: I rarely vote on theory; I recommend that you only run it if opponent is legitimately being unfair. Otherwise, theory will not be a voter but it may be used to help weigh the round.

Voters: I like a good framework debate. Every argument must go through a framework in order to have credence in the round. Make sure you don't use blanket statements while arguing v/vc like "my value encompasses more than my opponents value does, therefore prefer my value." Make sure there is substantial work on the v/vc side of the debate so you can make sure your offense is actually relevant. I need clear impact calculus and the impacts must go through a v/vc. If they do not, you essentially have zero offense. When I am deciding the end result in the round, I need the round to be clear and all extended arguments need to be impacted through a vc and must achieve a value. I will choose one framework to weigh the round so make sure you are winning the v/vc debate, especially if you and your opponent have vastly different vc's.
