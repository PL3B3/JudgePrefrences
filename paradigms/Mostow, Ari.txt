  I debated for Oakwood (CA), doing Lincoln Douglas debate on the national circuit level for 4 years. I don't care which arguments you choose to read; I will vote on just about anything as long as I understand it, and I award speaker points based on strategy and efficiency--even if the arguments don't excite me very much.
Important things
1. I default to drop the debater, competing interps, and no RVI's on theory unless you say otherwise.
2. I will vote on any argument, but I am most confident evaluating framework, then theory and tricks, then heavy util debates, and then kritiks. But hey, I'm fine voting on a K--just know you need to explain the warrants very clearly.

If you have any other questions, I encourage you to ask me before the round or email me at arimostow2021@u.northwestern.edu
