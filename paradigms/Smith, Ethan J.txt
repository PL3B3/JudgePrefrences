  Experience:
High School: Congress, 4 years, maybe 10 tournaments on the local circuit
College: 1 year of policy, 4 tournaments, competed on both Novice and JV levels

I’m fine with progressive debate and with speed. I can handle theory, Ks and other more complicated arguments. Just do a good job explaining them.I appreciate good signposting between and within arguments, especially if you’re moving quickly. It helps me to flow and understand the argument.Arguments are more important than speaking pretty.With that said, I still have to be able to understand you.I appreciate good use of weighing at the end of a round.I want you to tell me why you win. Give me a reason to vote for you. Tell me how to evaluate the round.
