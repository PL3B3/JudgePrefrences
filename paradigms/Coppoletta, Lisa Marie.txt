Pedagogy/Background
Feel free to ask me any specific questions prior to the round. I have always been open minded about argument theory and “run kritiks” on a daily basis as an activist in San Marcos, Texas. Debated for SWTSU, now TxState (1988 NDT) and coached at University North Carolina, Charlotte and Texas Lutheran University (early nineties). As an adjunct Speech instructor, for me academic debate is an extension of the classroom, and this reflects a mutual respect among competitors to facilitate a holistic learning context.

Substance
Academic debate is real world. You create any paradigm you wish with sufficient theoretical and substantive constructs and support (evidence or narrative) and go for it! I am well versed in pomo, critical theory, critical race theory, and the academic literature on narratives. Tell me spoken word, your real word experiences making a difference, or go old school policy perspective, just be passionate about your advocacy. Convince me you really believe what you are defending or attacking. I respect alternative visions of expressions for academic debate.

Style
Back when the Triceratops roamed the earth there was a significant amount of on case debate. Turns….I like case turns. If you run counterplans explain them clearly and slowly. If you are speaking to fast I will tell you. Please sign post. Please articulate your cards when you read them. If I can’t hear the advocacy from the evidence it will not make the argument convincing. If you are rude the speaker points will reflect that and the reflective is also true (if genuine).
