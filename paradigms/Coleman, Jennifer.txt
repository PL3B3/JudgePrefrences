I consider myself a traditional style judge. I don't like speed. If I can't understand your arguments then I can't flow them. If they're not on my flow then they don't exist in the round. I value the framework debate heavily when making a decision. If you can prove your value and value criterion is best and your contentions link in well, you'll get my vote. I want to you to debate the resolution and I hate theory and K's.
