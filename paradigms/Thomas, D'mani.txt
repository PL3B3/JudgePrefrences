  I did policy debate for 2 years in high school. Competed at a few tournaments in my first semester of college. 
I don't have any specifics for your debates, just explain the arguments. Make the decision clear for me, because if the debate gets messy I will end up voting for the argument that makes the most sense considering the flow and the world you all set up vs. the "debate jargon" thrown around during the round that may or may not convince most other judges.
