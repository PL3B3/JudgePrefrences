  Experience: I debated in high school, doing British Parlimentary and Public Forum Debate. I also do APDA since I joined the debate society of UC Berkeley.
Basics: I would love to vote for the team with a good framing. It will be brilliant if you can structure your speech clearly and strageticlally. Your need to show me the link between your argument and the motion, the relation between your story and your arguments. Please do tell me why your argument matters to the motion and do tell me why your arguments matter more than those of your opponents. If you let me weigh all the arguments on my own, I can't guarantee that your argument will have large impact to me.(Well, to me, swallowing five boxes of shampoon certainly doesn't damage a person as much as a hard CS exam does.) 
Strategy: Do take POIs at the right time and avoid taking too many of them. Please do point out if something your opponents say is False because the default value of your statements will be set to True. (If your opponent says that aliens will overtake this planet tomorrow, please tell me that it's not possible. Otherwise I have to belive it and prepare a spaceship for escaping the planet.) Also, I value teamwork. Cooperate with each other and never contradict your own arguments.
Theory: I really don't like theories! Please don't use theories in your debate. 
Speaking preferrences: I would really appreciate it if you have a clear structure, some easy-to-understand arguments (Avoid lecturing me about Nietzsche's view of life, I find it complicated and depressing.), and a not-so-loud voice with clear utterance. (Am I asking too much?) And really, do respect your opponents, avoid profanity.
Final Remark: Debate is about having fun and I really don't want to end this judging philosophy with all kinds of ways you could lose a debate or the standards you need to achieve. Enjoy yourself, otherwise, what's the point?
