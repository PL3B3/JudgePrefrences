Lindale HS (TX) ’15 
Texas Tech ’19 
Pre-nationals season update: 
-rounds on surveillance topic: 75+
-rounds on China topic: 50ish 
General 
-Yes, I want to be on the email chain (email above). Also, it would be dope if you could send me a doc with all of the cards compiled from each side. 
-Do you, I have no argument preference. I would rather see good debate than bad debate any day, so don’t conform to me, do what you’re best at. 
-I stick to my flow to determine the round. I hate intervening it rounds just because it makes me do more work than I want to do. I flow taglines, authors, dates, and warrants as I hear them in the ev. I also try to mark every piece of ev that you mark, but obviously this isn’t always a guarantee so please do this for yourself and email a marked version after the speech. 
-Tech > truth (with the exception of rhetorically violent arguments) 
-If you wanted the alt/cp judge-kicked, tell me explicitly to do so in the 2nr otherwise I will not kick it and will evaluate the offense under the advocacy. 
-Offense > terminal defense > defense 
-I tend to find myself in the middle of the spectrum on speaker points. As of Winter, 2016 my average with speaker points is about 28.5. My highest given out was a 29.5 to Crayton Gerst (if that gives you any insight to my speaker point allocation). My lowest given was a 27.4. My speaker points are given almost entirely on strategy, clarity matters little to me so long as I can understand it. If I cannot, I will clear you.

Aff 
-I tend to believe that affs should either be in the direction of the topic or an indictment of debate
-Performance debates are fun. 
-Small, hyper-specific policy debates are fun. 
-Role of the ballot is less persuasive to me that just framing arguments for me. 
-I think affs get away with too much on perms. If you read a general heg aff and read reformism good, you will need to tell me how your aff is a reform and not just an extension of the system to win access to that arg. 
-I’ve voted aff for K affs against T/Framework about the same amount of times I have voted neg on T/Framework. 

Topicality/Framework 
-competing interps frames my decision unless explicitly told why reasonability is preferable and why you win under reasonability. 
-T version of the aff is not an aff argument 
-Caselists are dope 
-Arguments that boil down to “get out of debate” against identity affs are not persuasive for me. Arguments like predictable limits and dialogue are much more persuasive. 
-I think T is under-utilized against policy affs and love T debates. 
-I tend to think that an untopical aff doesn’t cause extinction, but that may just be me. 

Disads 
-Uniqueness determines the direction of the link unless told why it’s the otherway around. 
-The more specific the link the more persuasive your 2nr will be. 
-There’s such thing as zero percent risk of an impact if you concede impact defense, otherwise there is at least a risk of an impact. 

CPs 
-The more specific the cp strat the better 
-Multiple plank CPs are great, kicking individual planks is okay with me unless there are any theoretical objections, then it’s up to that flow. 
-Uniqueness and internal-link CPs are super troll and I love them. 
-Solvency advocates make the world a better place
-Advantage CPs are my favorite counterplan debates to watch. 
-No real preconceived notions about condo/CP theory, that’s a debate you should get to have. 

Ks 
-The more specific the link the less persuasive the perm is 
-Role of the ballot is less persuasive to me that just framing arguments for me.
-K tricks make me happy 
-I am beginning to become more persuaded by the argument that there are no perms in a “method debate”. 
-Analysis is preferable to cards
