  Background: I predominantly did Parliamentary debate where I broke deep into elims at numerous tournaments and placed third at the CHSSA state tournament in 2008. I debated for Analy High School alongside Chris Catterton and currently coach LD and Parli there.

I ask for three things:
1. Slow down during tag lines. I come from a background of Parliamentary where I was highly successful, as such I am terrible at picking out distinct arguments from each other at high speed. Slowing down during tag lines allows me to pick out individual arguments and flow all of them.
2. Provide voters. Tell me where to vote and why I should vote there.
3. If you really want to go fast, make sure you are clear and enunciate very well. I get irritated at people who go faster than they are capable, and if I can't understand what you are saying, it doesn't end up on my flow, and you lose the round. If there is a specific point to your argument that is key, slow down and emphasize it like it ought to be if it is so awesome you are claiming you can win the entire round off of it. Slowing down to make an argument very clear shows how much that argument is worth to you. If you blip it out there you run the risk of my ears not picking it up.
