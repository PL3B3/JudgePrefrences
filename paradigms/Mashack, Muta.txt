  I debated at Science Park High School in Newark, New Jersey (Newark Science). I'm now an assistant debate coach at Science Park High School. I'm also a policy debater at Rutgers University in New Brunswick New Jersey.

Speed: Speed is not an issue, but you must be clear and slow down when reading tag lines and card names. I do not have a problem with shouting "clear", but I will only yell it twice. Clarity is very essential in evaluating and understanding arguments; I cannot vote on arguments that are not expressed clearly. Also, your speaker points are based on your clarity in the round.

- It is also very important to be clear when presenting analytical, critical arguments.

- An important component of debate is clash. With that being said, it is important that you don't spread for the sake of confusing your opponent. Even though you may win the round by doing this, you will risk loosing speaks.

Cross Examination: In cross-examination it is extremely important to not be rude, or condescending to your opponent (this could severely injure your speaker points). The point of debate is to educate, not to be rude to your opponent. This does not mean that cross ex has to be serious; I enjoy cross ex that is funny.
- Also, your argument will loses its credibility when you show a failure to answer questions posed by your opponent.
- Lastly, CROSS-EX IS BINDING. It is extremely unfair to lie during cross ex and then renege during your next speech.

Theory: Although I am not a big fan of theory, I will vote on it. However, THERE MUST BE CLEAR ABUSE IN THE ROUND. This means that I will not vote on theory ran for silly things, like your opponent not giving you his/her case during your prep. Furthermore, if theory is dropped you will lose the round. Because theory is an argument of competing interpretations, it must be argued.

Evidence: It is very important that evidence is fully cited. It is likely that I will call for evidence at the end of the round. If you evidence is not fully cited, then I will not use it to when making my decision. Please DO NOT miscut evidence; this is clear ground for you to lose the round.
- I believe that the main purpose of debate is education. For this reason, I it is important for you to allow your opponent so see your cards when they ask during the round. However, you saying no will not impact my final decision in the round, but it will hurt your speaks.

Presumption: I have no bias for AFF or NEG because it is unfair to presume a side since debaters have no control over whether they debate affirmative or negative. For this reason I DO NOT listen to presumption arguments at all.

Prestandard: I do not like prestandard arguments, so I WILL NOT vote on multiple apriori arguments. If a single apriori argument is run it will be very hard for you to win the round on it.

Speaks: I average about a 28.5. When you walk into the round you have a 30. You then are deducted speaks based on how you perform in the round. You will lose speaks for being rude, not being clear, not comparing evidence, good coverage/time allocation, take risks (straight refutation 1N), good extensions, good evidence.

Critical/Weird Arguments: I like critical arguments. Often, stock arguments are very boring, so it excites me when I hear critical or nuanced arguments. However, it is VERY important that you clearly explain these arguments in the case and even better in the rebuttals.

Delivery: it is very important for you to compare evidence, extend arguments and give the impact to those decision (Why is what you arguing enough for you to win the round). When extending arguments, it is important for you to use your evidence. When extending arguments include: Claim/Tag of the card, author/ card name, warrant from the card, & the implication from that extension.

Miscellaneous: I do not care if you stand or sit in the round; I donâ€™t care if you read from your laptop. Nor do I care about what you wear.
