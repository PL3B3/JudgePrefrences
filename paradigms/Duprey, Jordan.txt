  I graduated from Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York in 2013. I spent all four years doing debate primarily Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas.

In round I will vote off of anything provided you give sufficient justification and extend properly. I simply ask you weigh properly towards the end of the round to make the round easier to judge. I will vote for you purely off of the flow and will not debate for you whatsoever, the only exception being claims that are totally unwarranted. 

In terms of speed, I can handle a moderate amount but clarity is a mandatory prerequisite. I will let you know once and only once in round if you are unclear and after that it is up to you to gauge how clear you are. 

I am accepting of but only somewhat familiar with K's so I ask you slow down for my benefit throughout the round when this is being discussed. 

I also prefer that your arguments in round involve more than just theory. I believe it has a place in the round but it should definitely not replace discussion of the resolution itself. I can evaluate theory but I prefer not to.
