  I'm a policy debater for Southwestern College, go jaguars! Really, I'll vote on anything as long as you explain to me why I should. Don't just read a bunch of cards and expect me to do all the work for you. Tell me!!! "This is a case turn!", "This directly refutes this card!", "Vote for us because our impacts are coming bigger, faster, more probable", "They dropped this argument!" you know! So, yeah, there's no point in reading a bunch of cards if you're not going to tell me how they're important. That all being said, I'm usually not that big of a fan of topicality and I'm not that familiar with all the K's, so explain them to me well. When it comes to speed, just make sure you enunciate properly. I know you want to read a bunch of cards but if I can't understand you then what was the point? When it comes to cross x, it's cool if you don't know an answer or if your partner can explain it better to let your partner take that question. But don't let you partner monopolize your cross-x, it wont look bad when I choose who to vote for, but it will look bad on you speaker points... Oh! and when it comes to paperless, your prep wont end until the other team gets your drive, just sayin.
