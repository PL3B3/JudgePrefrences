  Paradigm: Lincoln-Douglas is value debate; meaning it's based in present time as a tool to weigh our values in current society and decide our ethical actions. This means that the debate ought to be weighed more heavily by framework and normative arguments than empirical statistics. Each contention must be addressed, but individual cards under the contention can be dropped without penalty.
Connect all of your arguments with your framework, and weigh your value against your opponent's. 
Follow the flow, and make it as easy as possible for me to follow your arguments in my own notes.
Don't spread - Lincoln-Douglas is just as much about being a persuasive speaker as it is about clear logic.
Philosophy: We're here to learn. The resolutions are written in such a way that there is no ultimate "right" answer, so simply stick to your case, and argue through as best you can.
My decisions are based upon technical aspects first, then speaking skills. However, if you do not communicate well due to speed and diction, it will be very difficult for me to follow your mastery of the technical aspects. One should compliment the other.
History: Debated policy at Southern Illinois University many years ago. I have coached and judged all forms of debate over my 42+ years as an educator. I have moved away from policy debate because of what I feel are current practices which minimize the value and emphasis on communication skills. I have embraced each new debate format from each ones' infancy and am afraid of the same issues creeping into those formats. I hope to keep communication alive in debate.
