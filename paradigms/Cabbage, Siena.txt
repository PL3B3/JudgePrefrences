ask for pronouns and respect them if you don't respect your opponents pronouns, don't expect to get my ballot.
give me and your opponent a copy of your cases before your speech idc how
i'm lazy the easier the decision the happier i'll be
all of my veiws can be changed by you
I want to be told what i should do with my ballot and what that means whether it be through fiat or micropolitical action or whatever just explain it so i can see why it is better than giving it to your opponent.
I Realy don't like theory aand won't vote on it unless there is legitimate abuse in round weighed against the other impacts in the round. also t isn't legitmate abuse
i'm not into t, i really don't want to give my ballot to it
Disclose if y'all want to don't if you don't its up to y'all but i really dont want to hear a disclosure theory round so please disclose okay?
Please do Impact framing and analysis for me
Don't make bigoted arguments if you have to question it probably don't
I mostly ran queer performance arguments but you do you, i want to see you in your zone, doing what you want will be the best way to my ballot regardless of how i feel
I like trigger/content warnings :D
If you extemp a blip storm make sure you go slow enough so i can flow cuz i wont vote on something that i dont have on my flow
I like music in rounds
i'm down to see hightheory fuckery as long as you can explain the impact to me and why i should vote with it
do whatever run whatever as long as you extend an impact and explain how it means you get the ballot you are in pretty solid place to get my ballot
I go to the easiest route to the ballot if this means tricks or things just extended through i'll do it.
On role of the jude, I am not an educator i have no degree nor expertise in whatever the topic is i see debate as both a forum of expression and a game of idea chess i think i am here to vote for one of you and i will vote for who best convinces me that their idea solves whatever problem it adresses in some way whether it be through intention or action
the ballot is a piece of paper
make this space yours do what you find best you have reasons you think your way of debate is right, tell me them
Theory/T/RVI
i don't like it when people put fake rules in place
most arguments in theory can be responded to without theory
i default sure on rvi's like i lit am not sure what that even means in the context of not wanting to see theory but like rvi's seem justified but ill be swayed easily
like really please don't do this, if this is your primary strategy strike me
Kritiks
did alot of them from Batille to Edleman but i'll be more comfortable the clearer you can make the link story
Need an alternative
more specific the link, more likely you are to get the ballot
state is bad but like you need better links
debaters have hella stories and they work in this space yo, like tell the stories of this space in this space
fillosofy/framework/analitic folx
i did some of this im not super well read into it tho
who even needs it tbh
same old same old, if you have a hot take im intrested
do the old stuff if it makes you happy
make the interactions between frameworks EXPLICTLY
afc is a joke
oh moral skep is gross if not used delicately
LARP
have an impact
don't rely on generic nuclear war more nuanced the senario the better
process cp's=heck yup on the troll level
need to weigh between layers
What i don't want in a round
a case thats mostly spikesAnarcho PrimAny of that junior partner bsany silencing of survivorsmarking cards without actuallyy marking cardsCryingOverly rude in cxgeneric link stories tell me why the ac specifically causes the impact not just like military increase.stolen backfiles that you don't understandFrivilous Theory if you have to ask then dont run it in front of me.Please no oppression olympics
IF AT ANY POINT IN THE ROUND YOUR OPPONENT HAS MADE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE (this doesn't just mean racism, sexism, or ableism arguments etc but instead turns to racism, turns to sexism, or other similarly offensive or triggering arguments) pound three times on the desk (this is so you don't feel like you will be stopping the round) and I will stop the round and have a discussion with your opponent about what they have done and will give you a 30 for putting up with it. This also means that I will have to have to agree that what they did was offensive, but this shouldn't be too difficult (my threshold is low, but I wont intervene unless you ask me to because I dont know your limits or personal perspective) .
if you have any questions email me or find me before the round i am always willing to answer paradigmatic questions
SPECIFIC POINTS FOR POLICY
explain the impact; i won't do the link chain work for you
please explain the link
framework in front of me is a waste of time
performance is fun
high theory is fun
framework makes me sad
i flow the aff on one peice of paper and same for each off case
if it takes more than 4 mins to get the aff out, my head might explode and your speaks will get nuked
