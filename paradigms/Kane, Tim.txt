  I began in debate about 22 years ago as policy debate coach. I was the director of debate at T.A. Edison High School in Alexandria Virginia for about 15 years and had some success. During the last 4 years of my tenure I coached Lincoln-Douglas exclusively. I am presently coaching my nephew.
I am willing to listen to just about anything and evaluate the round based on what is on the flow. I have two significant limits; 1st Advocacy shifts â€“ If the issues is pre-standard than say so. Do not advocate that something is one thing in the constructive and then sift that advocacy in rebuttals.  2nd Arguments that are on face morally repugnant (I believe this is self explanatory).
I value debaters that clearly impact and weigh their arguments and are able to clearly define a decision matrix. I also value civility. Be nice, be smart, and remember to have fun and we should be fine.
