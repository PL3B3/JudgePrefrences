This is my third year judging debate. I am a parent judge with a lot of experience judging lay LD and Public Forum; however, I am not as familiar with circuit.
I have trouble understanding speed and crazy philosophical frameworks. Circuit terminology is also foreign to me, I find it particularly hard to wrap my head around kritiks,

On the other hand, I do enjoy well reasoned arguments, especially those that are logical and make sense versus the ones that involve things like alien invasions and computer universes.
The most important part is to tell me why one argument is more important than another, otherwise I will be forced to make my own decisions.
I am okay with plans and counter plans, although you may want to avoid adding too many "layers" to the debate like kritiks and shells because things can become jumbled very quickly and I won't know what to vote for in the round.

Just try to keep the round simple. Weigh and crystallize.
