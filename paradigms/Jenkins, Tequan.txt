In a debate round i have done everything from cp and politics to performance

My first High School topic was aid to peoples in poverty.

 I may vote on anything, it could come down to Counterplan-Disad, Procedurals, Kritiks, Affs with no plan text, or even performance. tell me what your argument is and what the ballot signifies (if it has a meaning)...i.e. policy maker etc...(...)

Speaker Points: Be persuasive and make it interesting thin line between funny and ass hole at times may it be in cross-x or your speech you decide, but disrespect of any kind will result in a 25 so basically keep the attitude and vulgarity locked away...analysis/argumentation (don't lie about reading a whole card if u didn't,don't just read cards and tag~line extend ~_~ ) I will call for evidence if needed. And a great line by line will be appreciated.


Topicality: I like a good t debate, their fun and at times educational, make sure you impact it, and give a correct abuse story...

Counter Plans: have a good net benefit prove how they solve the case

Dis Ads: You can run them i vote for anything and am familiar with most scenarios

Kritique: I was a K dbater for the better half of my debate career so i'm pretty familiar with most k-lit u will read unless its a more in-depth 
nietzsche, zizek, lacan or something of that standard but nevertheless i will get it...and if you explain it give a good story and show alternative solvency I will vote for it...it is also fine if you kick the alt and go for it as a case turn just debate it out...

Preformance: Explain what the round comes down to...i.e. role of the judge/ballot/debaters...and if their is a form of spill over what this is and means in real world and debate world... block framework ...and show me why your/this performance is key...may it be a movement or just you expressing your self...i like methodology debates so if it comes down to the aff and neg being both performance teams be clear on the framework for the round and how your methodology is better and how the other may recreate these forms of oppression you may be speaking about...may it be the deletion of identity or whiteness etc...same things apply if your running a counter~advocacy against a performance team......k vs performance rounds same as methodology prove the link and as for the alt prove the solvency... framework vs performance rounds i had a lot of these, boring but fun to see the way they play out depending on interpretation, vio, impacts, etc...

Framework: any kind is fine...same justification as Topicality...depending on how your spinning framework within a round...

Theory: sure

Short & sweet
