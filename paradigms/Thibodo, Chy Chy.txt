  Background: I graduated from Robbinsdale Cooper High School in 2010. I have been a coach in the Robbinsdale district for three years. I went to the NFL National Tournament in Public Forum, and qualified in Congressional Debate. My senior year, I made it to quarter finals at the Minnesota State Tournament.
Decision Making: I both debated and now judge primarily on the local Minnesota circuit. I will make a decision on the flow: I will listen to theory and critical argumentation but I will make a decision based on the flow (this means everything from the value to the contentions).I know that value debate has all but vanished from LD, but I would appreciate a real debate and clash on the values.I will accept speed; however, I will say “clear” only ONCE, and then I will cease flowing you.Tell me what to do: I refuse to make any decision for myself. I absolutely will not intervene. If you stand up and tell me that the United States does not have a space program, and your opponent does not contest it, I would consider the argument. Obviously, that’s dumb, but that’s why you should contest stupid arguments.
