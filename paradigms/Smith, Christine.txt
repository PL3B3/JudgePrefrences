  Christine (Chris) Smith
Barrington High School, IL

My name is Chris Smith and I'm the parent of a novice Lincoln-Douglas debater at Barrington High School. For those of you at the Harvard tournament, this is my first tournament ever judging, so I recommend if you do get me as your judge, speak at a normal conversational speed, sign-post and give clear voting issues.

Best of luck to you!
