Judging Experience: minimal judging in high school debate class

I debated for one year in Lincoln-Douglas in the Northern Nevada NSDA district during my senior year; I will be judging for the first time in February 2017 at the Harvard circuit tournament.

I very highly prize a well-structured LD case. I should be able to very clearly determine the links between your contentions, V, and VC. I give much more weight to this aspect of LD than I do to arguments surrounding contentions. Although, of course, to win the round I would like to see at least one standing contention. I also appreciate creativity in interpreting the resolution, as long as you justify it.

I am not at all opposed to kritiks in LD rounds. However, you should make sure that your reasoning behind the kritik is clear to me and to your opponent. A badly-explained kritik can seem extremely esoteric to the point of dodging any clash during the round (depending on the ethical framework you're relying on). Unless you explain your argument extremely well and unambiguously, pulling a wordy quote from an obscure philosopher to back your kritik will not win you any points in my eyes.

I don't flow during cross-examination (I do listen closely), so any arguments you make there will need to be reiterated in another speech. Cross-ex will affect how I give out speaker points, though.
