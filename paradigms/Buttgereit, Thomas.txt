  ---First year debater from Binghamton University
---Consistently placed in elimination rounds in Novice debate, won Rutgers 2014 tournament in the novice division. 
---Running and learning mostly critical arguments but can judge “traditional” policy debate and will vote for the best argument in the round. 
Things to Do:
--- Clash with the other team; answer their arguments as directly as possible. 
--- It’s important to make eye contact with the judge during cross examination. 
--- It is important to not make just tagline extensions, and explain arguments that you’re making.
--- I am not familiar with this year’s high-school topic so make sure you explain any topic related terms or terms.
--- I am not very familiar with policy literature. So if you are running those arguments make sure you do not just extend the author name.
--- I believe that debate should be a safe space so avoid offensive and hostile language. I will vote for impacted out arguments against language used in round.
