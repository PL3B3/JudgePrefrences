  Shayla Bryan - Paradigm

Definitely want to see value clash in a debate round. If the negative cannot offer a value which clashes with the one offered by affirmative, by default, I go with the affirmative. However, I also like to see affirmative offer a criterion and a clear pathway for the resolution to achieve that criterion. I will vote based on criterion. If these are are both met, I will vote based on dropped arguments. A dropped argument will lose a team a round.

No previous LD judging/debating experience.
