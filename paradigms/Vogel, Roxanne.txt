  I am employed as a higher education administrator and I am new to judging speech and debate.

I appreciate a well considered argument with clearly stated points and evidence. Speaking clearly is highly desired and, in the case of LD, spreading is distracting and will likely cause me to miss many of the points you are trying to squeeze in. I find it much more effective for debaters to limit their arguments to fewer well developed contentions with clearly supportive evidence and efficient and effective anticipation of the other side than a multitude of points that are neither well considered nor fully developed.

Respect the time; making good use of it and respect your opponent. Assume that I am intelligent, and knowledgeable but not an expert and that I have an open mind. Above all else, I appreciate debaters who are well prepared and ready to have fun with the process.
