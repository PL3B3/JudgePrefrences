  Background
Judging Varsity LD since 2011(Local/Regional/National). Never competed in debate. Over 25 years experience instructing/evaluating/judging commercial and military aviation.

Philosophy : ALL forms of LD argument are acceptable. I strive to be as TAB as possible. I can only judge what you argue. Do not expect any type of intervention.

Delivery: Enunciate properly. "Clear" call should be heeded immediately. LD jargon will occasionally fail to connect with me.

Theory: Regardless of complexity, any allegation of abuse will require clear support through standards connected to a superior voter issue. If a superior issue is not marginally established, I will revert to flow and weight of conventional/topical arguments.
