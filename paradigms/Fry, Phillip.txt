  Summary
I have been judging debates for 4 years because my children debate. I have a very limited understanding of technical aspects of debate and would prefer a slow, persuasive style. I do not like nuclear war impacts, and would rather everyone just speak logically about the merits of the plan.

Disads
Make sure to have a good explanation of how it interacts with the aff. 

Counterplans
While not a huge fan of the counterplan, if explained well I can be sympathetic to them.

T
I don't love listening to T debates but if you really don't think they are topical, don't hesitate to call them out. To vote on T I need an explanation of why their inclusion in the topic is bad for debate as a whole.

K
Don't
