  I have been a speech and debate coach for the past ten years (eight as a head coach and the last two as an assistant). In this time, I have judged plenty of LD at local and travel tournaments (state and districts included).
I look for a definitive value and criterion, the ability to carrying enough of one’s well-reasoned arguments through while effectively countering one’s opponent’s arguments, a speaking style that allows for understanding (I can’t be impressed if I don’t understand what a debater is saying; I’ve never been into auctioneers), and organized cross examination that allows for clear questions and answers. CX is not the determining factor but I listen and take it into consideration. I like a combination of philosophy and real world examples with impacts. The real world carrying a bit more weight. Quality is definitely appreciated over quantity. Be specific and in-depth whenever possible. I have yet to judge the criminal justice system topic but am familiar with the dynamics of the issue.
