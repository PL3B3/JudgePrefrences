  Castro, Veronica

I am a parent judge. My daughter has done LD for 3 years and dabbled in PF. I have judged both events many times.
I prefer traditional, SLOW and impacted debates.
Explain exactly how you will the round because I will not make assumptions for you.
I will not vote on anything I do not understand. I will not understand you if you talk quickly, run critical arguments or theory.

I don't flow, but I do take notes.
