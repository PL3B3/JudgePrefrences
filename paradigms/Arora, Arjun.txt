  I debated for Arbor View H.S. (Las Vegas, NV.) on the national circuit for one and a half years (2013-2014, 2014-2015) as an independent. My senior year I reached two bid rounds (Greenhill, Meadows).

I am fine with any warranted argument, run what you please.

Slow down for texts/interps. I will yell clear/slow/any other adjective 3 times before I deduct speaker points.

I default to competing interps, drop the argument, and no RVI--any argument, with a semblance of a warrant, will change this.

I don't know how much this helps; but, my favorite judge, when I was a debater, was Grant Weisberg (http://judgephilosophies.wikispaces.com/Weisberg%2C+Grant).

Have fun!
