  LD - I am an old school values debate judge. I am a Comm judge with a flow pad and multi colored pens! I expect a proper framework (Value is the ideal your case upholds, Criterion is the weighing mechanism for the round). If you choose to take a non-traditional V/C or framework option, explain it! I don't like speed in LD, if I'm not flowing you are speaking too fast. If you have a non traditional V/C, please speak at a normal speed. If you go too fast for me to grasp your view, it doesn't matter how great it is. I like logic, rhetoric and evidence that enhance your contentions. If you use evidence please don't site, "Higgans, Harvard". Add "Professor of Economics at Harvard, Higgans, 2010." If you site a source a second time, "Higgans, Harvard" is good enough. If you site your sources like this for me and your opponent does not, you will benefit. If neither you or your opponent cite sources the way I like, then no one benefits and no one gets dinged. I do not like the use of Kritik in LD unless it directly relates to the resolution and the debate occurring in the room and you win me over with your fantatic LD skill. Decorum is important to me.

PF - Public Forum is intended to appeal to a wide audience. I flow PF. Convince me your overall point of view is valid and give me contentions with evidence that enhance your contentions.If you use evidence, please site your sources. Name of Source. Publication Source is from. Year of Source. Support your contentions by making logical, well constructed arguments. Do the same when you refute your opponent's contentions. You can leverage common knowledge if it is truly common.
Decorum is extremely important to me, then logic, then rhetoric. Tell me why your views are better than your opponents. Tell me why your team wins. Don't tell me what the other team needs to do to win or try to put an unnecessary burden on your opponent.
