  My judging philosophy is rather straightforward: I will give my ballot to whomever makes the most sense and makes the fewest mistakes. If a competitor says something patently wrong or illogical, even if it is not exploited by his or her opposition, it will count against him. Also: Regarding the often-heard LD contention regarding the relative importance of that which protecting an object vs. the object being protected, I generally tend to believe that the object being protected has higher value. As far as specific likes, I enjoy seeing direct clash of ideas, spot-on historical examples that exemplify a point, and turns (using the oppositionâ€™s evidential support or points or words against her). I also like to see civility and respect for the opposition.
