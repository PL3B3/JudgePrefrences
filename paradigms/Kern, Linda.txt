  I am a parent judge from Randolph High School (NJ).

I appreciate quality in arguments and will evaluate the round as objectively as possible. Please do not spread or run theory. I will be most comfortable evaluating a debate on the topic as opposed to a kritikal or prefiat debate. I am most comfortable evaluating traditional rounds with value criterions and contentions linking back to them.
