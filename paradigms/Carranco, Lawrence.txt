  I would consider myself a traditional impact calculus judge, the framework can be advanced but it is still important and I will vote off of it so it's best to tell me why you win the framework.
I'm as tabula rasa as humanly possible - I am not a robot though - tell me WHY something is important to the round and why you win it and if it's sufficient I'll vote off of it. WEIGH PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF PETE WEIGH YOUR IMPACTS.
DON'T be racist, sexist, ableist... or any kind of '-ist' in round.
Speed: I'm okay with rapid speaking but I'd prefer if you don't spread, I will call one verbal clear w/o taking it out in your speaker points but after that you won't get anything higher than a 27. Have clear tags and clear card names
Kritiks - I'm fine with them as long as the alt is extremely thorough and clear
DAs - IMPACT them
CP - If they're good use them if they're there to take up time I'd prefer you not, IMPACT them
Theory - I will vote off of anything if it's reasonable and well explained but I generally don't like theory so if it's a waste of time I won't even consider it for the RFD.

Remember I am a traditional judge.
