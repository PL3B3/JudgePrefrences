  I am currently a debater for Los Rios College and my experience is in policy debate.

As a judge I am open minded and will be as unbiased as I can be. My preferences come from my personal experience in rounds, and feedback given to me by judges I've had myself. 
I am a flow judge so I will do my best to keep a careful record of the arguments. 

These are my preferences:
I don't mind speed, I understand it's importance.
I don't care too much for framework.
I have a high respect for organization. 
Don't expect me to comprehend what I have flowed. I want you to do that for me. Sell me your argument. I really want to know that you understand your argument.
I understand that rounds can be very charged and stressful. Try to avoid being mean or rude.
I like confidence.

In the end, I vote based on who won on my flow.
