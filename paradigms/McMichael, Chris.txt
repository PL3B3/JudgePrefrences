    I debated at Marcus High School for four years, and competing at both local and national tournaments.  I graduated high school in 2007 and am currently in college.  Last year I did not participate in the activity very much and only judged a couple of tournaments.
    When judging I vote for arguments that are being won and properly extended and linked back to the criterion/standard/burden established in round.  Chances are that both debaters are going to be winning and extending some arguments, so please weigh your arguments.
    I will vote for pre-standard arguments.  But make sure the argument is clearly labeled as pre-standard and make sure you have justified why I should look to it first.
    If there is Theory, it needs to be clear, convincing, and a justification for why it comes before the standard.  For me a theory argument should have a statement of what is being valued (ex. Equality, fairness, etc.), why we should value this in debate,  how it is being violated, and a reason to vote on this issue before the standard, or why it’s the argument I should evaluate first.
    Since I have been out of debate for about a year, I am a little rusty when it comes to flowing.  Make sure your speeches are well organized and you are signposting.  If you wish to go fast, make sure you are being clear.  Be aware that I am not the best at flowing, and if I cannot understand your argument, its not going to be on my flow.
    Your strategy and style are your own, and I am not going to dictate how you should or should not debate.  It doesn’t matter to me if you go line by line or big picture, give voters or don’t, etc.
