  I am a lay judge. Very lay. Please don't spread because I won't understand you. At all. And please no theory. I don't want to judge a debate about the rules of debate. I am looking for a persuasive case. I want to be persuaded. I'm sorry because that's probably not what you've prepped for. It may seem lame. But I just can't understand you if you talk super fast, and then the result would be super random and that wouldn't be good. At all. Thank you, and good luck!
