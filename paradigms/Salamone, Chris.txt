I have no preference of approach, K, DA, Theory, spreading or otherwise. However, I am interested in propagating the long-term success of forensics in public education. Therefore, if you are employing a strategy that I cannot support for my students, parents, or principal, I will likely vote the other way. My goal is to remain a passive observer and to weigh the merits and flaws of both cases against each other. In this process, please be explicit in your reasoning and the chain of logic you are using to win the round. Merely mentioning a well recognized theory or claiming to have won the round on face value, will never work unless your opponent offers no case. Depth is important in both organization and analysis, even if you only have a single argument. 

Statements made during cross will be remembered, but not outcome determinative unless you solidify later on.

In terms of character, please be respectful and mindful of your opponent. If they are significantly more or less prepared than you are, I would expect you to treat them as a fellow human being in pursuit of self improvement. If you are spreading and your opponent can't understand you, please slow down. Winning a round through churlish antics, is directly contrary to the purpose of debate: to create more a well-rounded, aware, compassionate, and capable citizenry.

Thanks for reading and feel free to bombard me with questions in the round.

Cheers
