Debate is about winning – you should do whatever you think will win.


Framework: This is really not my thing. I think that most framework debates have become utterly predictable and often are excuses for being lazy. Dont be weak, and use it as a tool to not have to research or engage the aff. However I am a fan creativity and experimentation so if you can come up with a nuanced framework or roll with something other than shively then you might be alright.

T – These debates could be interesting, however I would hope to not have to decide a round on T.


DA/CP – I enjoy these debates. I probably err neg on counterplan theory.

K: This is what most of my college experience involves and the literature that I am most familiar with. I often find the permutation to be a vague co-option strategy or in many ways an advocacy shift, and honestly believe that the negative should be allowed to counter-perm. I do not think that AI’s are floating pics, especially if they are done in response to the affirmatives framework demands.

AFF’s – Do whatever you feel like, be it policy, performative, or any other form of argumentation. Aff’s should probably have some relationship to the topic, but I do not care what that relationship is.

Stylistic Things: You can debate in whatever style that you would like, and I will flow or not flow each speech according to how the debater or debaters speaking ask me to.
