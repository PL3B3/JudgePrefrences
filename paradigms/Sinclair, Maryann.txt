  I am currently competing at the college level for Debate. I am a simple judge, I will vote on procedurals such as T. I like clear impacts with good articulation on you get access to those impacts. I enjoy good rebuttals that specifically lay out why I should vote for you.
· I don’t time road maps· Show respect to your opponents· I will provide feedback after the round

At the end of the round I am looking for good argumentation with claim warrants and data. Smile and have fun
