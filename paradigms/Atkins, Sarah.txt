  Background: I'm a Yale sophomore who did LD debate for four years in high school. I also judged LD at this tournament last year.

Paradigm:

Speed: I will take points off for speaking so quickly as to be incoherent. This is LD, not policy--clarity matters.

Theory/Kritiks: Not a fan. Clash is usually sacrificed for these kinds of debates, and I personally believe clash is one of the most important aspects of a debate round.

Other: I'm not looking to take points off of your score; present a good case that relies on a strong argument and not weak tactics, and you will score well.
