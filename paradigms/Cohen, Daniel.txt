  My name is Daniel Cohen and I have competed for four years and coached for two years at the high school level. Primarily, I focus on Lincoln-Douglas debate, but have extensive experience in Congress, Public Forum, and Extemporaneous Speaking.

My judging paradigm for Lincoln-Douglas is fair traditional with a focus on values and analysis. Values and value criteria are a necessity, while thorough signposting of contentions is recommended. Cards and warrants are meaningless without an analysis of why they support a contestant's position.
