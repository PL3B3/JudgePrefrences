  Important Stuff:
I am a junior debater for Pace Academy. I am very well read on the space topic.

I much prefer listening to a DA and Case or an impact turn debate. CP's are okay but I am a 2a and am liable to err aff on theory issues.

It is important to have a topical Affirmative and I think that having a large topic would hurt education about the topic.

K's are not my forte. You should run them if you wish but be wary as you will need to explain them more than usual

I love the USA
