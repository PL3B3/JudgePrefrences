  I have debated for three years in New York City, while I attended Stuyvesant High School and graduated in 09'. I have judged numerous tournaments before and am happy to listen to a variety of arguments.

Below is a little about my judging style. If you absolutely have any other questions, let me know ahead of the round and I will be happy to answer them.

- Argumentation: I am fairly laid back as to the argumentation that you use (values, theory, critiques), but whatever form of argumentation you do choose to use, please be clear and responsive. Please make sure that you carry the arguments down the flow and explain how you are linking your arguments and why they are important for you winning the round.

- Speed: It is not a problem, but make sure you make it clear which points you are talking about. As long as you sign post, I will flow it.

- Impacting and Weighing the round: At the end of the round, I would like to have a clear idea of how to weigh the arguments. Therefore, it is to the best advantage of both debaters to make it clear how the round should be weighed, instead of leaving it all to me. During your last speech, tell me which arguments are fundamental to the round and why your points must be looked to, rather that your opponent.

- Speaker Points: Just be respectful, responsive, and substantiate your arguments and you will have absolutely no problem with them!
