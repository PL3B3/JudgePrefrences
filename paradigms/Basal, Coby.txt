  Background: I have debated in high school from my sophomore year through my senior year. I have gained experience in Lincoln Douglass debate after competing in many regional competitions. However, I am a traditional, lay judge.
  
 Jargon/Theory: I suggest that you stay away from theory. I strongly urge you to explain everything you say as well as you can.
  
 Speed: Please don’t spread; try to speak as clearly as possible. Also, try to change your intonations as you flow from one contention to the next or as you switch between a card and your own text.
  
 Judging the round: Whoever defends his/her own case better and attacks his/her opponent’s case better will win the round. It’s not the number of arguments you make, but rather the quality of the arguments that you make that will matter most. I’m looking for well-argued, rational arguments. I recommend that you employ philosophical and logical arguments while not losing focus of values.
