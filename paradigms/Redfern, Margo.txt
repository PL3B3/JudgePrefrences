  I have been to many tournaments and am more of a tabula rasa judge style. I prefer a medium speed of speech delivery. I will be weighing the original arguments made at the beginning of the round at the end and see which have been responded to or not and if they were, then how well the opposing team pulled off the rebuttal. My son is currently participating in varsity policy debate.
