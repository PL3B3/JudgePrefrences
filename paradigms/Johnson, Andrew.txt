  I am affiliated with St. Louis Park High School in Minnesota. Shockingly enough, I also went to High School there. I have judged 2 tournaments on this years topic so far. I graduated in 2006 and have judged off and on since then.

I will vote on topicality, though I am no expert. I ran it a few times in high school and I get the general idea, so it should be fine. I have never been a huge fan of Critiques, but if it wins it wins. I have an idea of how they work and have lost to them in the past and my team had a few on file, but I never ran them. I will flow it and you tell me why you win with it and it should be fine.

I guess I am willing to vote on most things as long as you tell me why it matters. Nothing I am super biased against or really in favor of.
