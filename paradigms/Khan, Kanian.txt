        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        Critical arguments

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Speak clearly, put the right arguments in the right places, make it easy for me to flow

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Speaks unclearly, jumps around between flows, makes it harder for me to flow

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        The cap k

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        Any sort of offensive impact turns
