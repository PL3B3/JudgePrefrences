  My name is Haele Wolfe, and I have been judging LD on the national circuit for 2 years. I prefer a traditional LD style, heavy on philosophy and reason, where the value structure reigns supreme. Evidence is good as long as you provide a warrant and show impact on the round. Where I do tolerate a rapid delivery without prejudice (as long as your message remains clear), I am most definitely not a fan of spreading. If you see my eyes rolling back into my head, SLOW DOWN. Please leave that to the policy folks! I do appreciate key voting issues being identified as long as they are true to the round and not canned.
