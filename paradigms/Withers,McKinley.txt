  I believe that every good debate becomes its own animal. Good debaters adapt to each round and provide solid reasoning and evidence that clashes directly with an opponents position. Although theory arguments have their place, I don't like when the debate gets so distracted by theoretical arguments about the nature of debate that the debaters don't affirm or negate the resolution. I am open to unique styles of argumentation but don't sacrifice your case and offense for the sake of off topic arguments and K's. That doesn't mean I discourage kritiks though. Speed is fine but not just for the sake of being fast, speak quickly because you have to and make your arguments clear regardless. Organization always helps me flow and make a better decision in the end. 
As Lincoln-Douglas is a value debate I do want to see your case be driven by some value, although the format by which you do so is up to you.
