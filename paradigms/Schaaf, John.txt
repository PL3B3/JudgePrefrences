  LD: Traditional judge. Debate the resolution. LD is a value debate. That equates to whether your position is a good idea or not. Convince me.The criterion should be the weighing mechanism for any contentions you might have (it helps me). There are no burdens. Kritiks are inappropriate.
Communicate clearly. Avoid jargon. Do not assume that I remember each card or sub-point. Establish the authority of your warrants. A summary of voters clarifies and is helpful; lack thereof risks that I might not recall the argument.
I will try to remain a tabla rasa and vote only on the arguments presented and debated. Of course if you don't debate an argument, your opponent may claim it as won, although minor points or points irrelevant to the main argument are probably not going to be deciding.

In PF, convince me that your side is the best position using impeccable logic, authoritative evidence and respected opinion. I am rather data driven so dazzle me with it, but do not baffle me with broccoli.
