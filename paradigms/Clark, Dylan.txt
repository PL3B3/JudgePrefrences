  I debated policy in high school for a few years. I now do NPDA and NFALD for Truman State University.

Philosophy: I don't really have predispositions on any arguments. I believe debate is all about winning the time trade off and offense. You say it, I flow it. If I can't flow it, then you are probably not saying anything. And I like T...a lot.
