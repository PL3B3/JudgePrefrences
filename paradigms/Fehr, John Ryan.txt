Background: I debated policy at Stratford Academy for four years where I went to several national tournaments. I have judged in the past but have not judged on this topic and for the most part am unfamiliar with many of the arguments run.

As far as arguments go I don’t really care what you run as long as you can defend it well and you can warrant your claims. I’m fine with disads/counterplans or kritical and T or theory styles of debate but in any case make sure your argument is warranted and explain it to me. You shouldn’t run something you’re uncomfortable with in order to suit my preferences.

Typically this is how my speaker points break down:
25-26: good, but could improve
27: average
28: good
29: very good
30: one of the best rounds I’ve heard
Being generally assertive can be a key component in rounds, but extremely unnecessary rudeness will lower your speaker points. Being entertaining or funny will move your points in the other direction.
