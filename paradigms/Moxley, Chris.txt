  Note - this is a fake and joking wiki that we created for Moxley's birthday! His real Judge Philosophy is at

Chris Moxley
Alpharetta 2014
South Carolina 2018 - not debating but Lundberg wrote my comm book so I basically am right!?

Fun facts
- I actually was in attendance for Herman Cain's 2012 announcement of his candidacy for President. If you go to the following video and turn up the volume pretty loud starting at 3:55, at 4:04 I'm the guy that yells "USA". Seriously.

- Nicole Moxley is actually related to me. One time, me and her debated together and read 5 conditional off case positions.
- My dog's name is Janie Lynn. It's in our Christmas card!
- “Even without reading Harry Potter, Chris Moxley sounds like a character out of Harry Potter” – John Turner

Top-Level
- Show me your flows after the round for some free points. If you make the argument "hard debate is good debate", I'll be looking at your flows during the round when I light them on fire. Hard debate is good debate right!!
- STOP PUTTING YOUR OVERVIEWS ANYWHERE BESIDES AT THE TOP. What is this magic trickery meant to sketch yourself into a ballot!?
- If you flowed the Aff in the wrong color, your max is a 27.5. I'm very particular. You'll know the correct color to use at the start of the 1AC. Unless I'm flowing on a laptop. Then just assume it's blank ink for the Aff.
- I judge how you like me to judge as long as you don't read stuff about how Russia is friends with the U.S. in the squo. That's just not true. Tech over truth in all instances except that one.
- Give road maps and guide me, here's how not to do it:
Novice 1: Can I have the Road map
Novice 2: Yeah sure *pulls out map of school*


Case
- Most internal links are terrible. The Neg should indict their evidence. If you can't find at least 3 cards that serve as Negative evidence, you're doing something wrong. Unless you're hitting icebreakers. Then all of the evidence is perfect and you should not bother extending or reading any case arguments.
- The analytic-to-card ratio should be pretty high.


Chipotle Order
Burrito with White Rice; No Beans; Chicken; Medium Salsa; Sour Cream; Cheese
Guac on odd-numbered days of the month
No Chips
Coca Cola - Pepsi is the ZPH

DA
- Because of the usual AHS BM Neg block, I don't really take these often. You should explain them. Politics DA's are pretty great.
- Read condo on the DA flow. Got'em! By the way, condo is probably bad. It's debatable though. The Aff should specify their preferred interpretation, whether it is 1 condo, -1 condo, unconditional, funditional, dispositional, 
- I'll give you .1 extra if you start a Politics shell in the 1NC with "First off is elections!"

UNPROVOKED RANT
IM NOT ONE OF THOSE JUDGES WHO IS GOING TO SPEND THE WHOLE DEBATE ON GCHAT AND "FOLLOW ALONG" WITH THE SPEECH DOCS, THEN DECIDE ENTIRELY ON EVIDENCE QUALITY. REMEMBER THAT I ACTUALLY LISTEN AND FLOW. SAVE THE CARD EXPLOSIONS FOR JUDGES WHO JUST "LISTEN" AND DO THE EVIDENCE COMPARISON AFTER THE DEBATE.

ALSO I REALLY LIKE SUSHI NOW. AND OUR SUSHI WAITRESS KNOWS ME REALLY WELL

CP
- Better have a solvency advocate. Anything resembling the Clyde CP will be responded to with a prompt yelling by me of "FFFIAAATTT". If I say that, you better have a good solvency advocate or you're going down. (clyde shepherd is cool tho but tan tan the ladies man is cooler. but jake movsovitz is the only pace debater who can DOUGIE which is even cooler)
- When setting up a consult CP, asking "Do we consult anyone before doing the Aff" is a bad idea.

K
- NO. DO I LOOK LIKE A HIPPY. I GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, NOT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY'REBOTH USC. GET OVER IT. BUTTTT I LOVE:

- K's of specific words like "crazy" - Ladies and gentlemen, it is time once and for all to break down the use of ableist language in our everyday lives. My ballot is not simply a signing of a meaningless sheet of paper at a small high school in the middle of Georgia, it is a call for the liberation of language! Ahoy comrade, let's start a revolution! I actually only like these in odd-numbered rounds. Elim debates are a coin flip before the round.
- Taoism. Who doesn't?

T
- T QPQ T QPQ YOU SHOULD ALWAYS READ IT. 1 OFF T QPQ = AUTOMATIC 29 OR ABOVE


OCEANS TOPIC UPDATE: T - SEA BED IS THE NEW QPQ YES YES YES LET'S GO. IT'S WHERE THE OCEAN SLEEPS AT NIGHT

- If your Aff is sketchy, then I suggest you load up in the 2AC. The Moxley standard is somewhere between 20 and 30 answers, all of which need to be different warrants. If your Aff seems illegit and I don't have to use 2 sheets for the 2AC on T, something is wrong.
- If the 1NC is throwing out random violations that the Aff obviously meets, what is up with that! A smart person once said:
“It’s like roller skating in a speedo…you’re just not doing it right"
- ASPEC is probably not the best either.
“Can I PLEASE still read ASPEC as a time skew?”

Speaker Points
- The reading of the 1AC is really important in terms of points. Think about it like a job interview. First impressions matter.
- Don't try to bribe me. Unless you have laffy taffy. Then maybe.
- 2AC Politics Jokes are key - examples
 Farm bill won't pass - didn't get fertilized in the House
 CIR got stopped at the border
 Postal bill didn't get delivered to the Senate
- Pinball Pete's is a pretty cool place. If you reference it, I'll <3 you.
- Krispy Kreme lyrics as tags are great.
- Extra points if you bring pets to debates. I brought one to a baseball game once:
