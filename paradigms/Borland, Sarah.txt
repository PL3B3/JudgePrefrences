  I am open to any and all arguments as long as they are justified in round. I will decide rounds based on the criteria of the debate event, Lincoln Douglas is based on value, Policy on evidence, and Public Forum on argument. I have no issue with speed but it must be clear. I will only vote on abuse if it is a clear issue in a round but if there is abuse happening you must tell me about for me to vote. I am non interventionist so if you want me to vote on an issue you must tell me.
