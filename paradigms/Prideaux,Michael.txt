  I debated for St. Louis Park for 5 years qualifying to the TOC my senior year and now I coach for Hopkins High School. Basically I agree with Christian except that I am OK with continental philosophy so long as it is warranted and you slow down a bit on the more dense stuff. No one wants to hear Lacan read at 350wpm and if they say they do they’re liars. I won’t be as fast a flower as I used to be, considering I will only judge at like 4 tournaments tops. I’m sorry if that hinders your strategy but I will try to keep up as best as I can and will yell clear if I don’t understand you. In terms of speaks I don’t have a scale but I’m typically a point fairy (or at least I was when I judged novice). I don’t care if you run policy positions or metaethics, just be smart. DON’T RUN DISCLOSURE THEORY OR BE RUDE. Cool. If you get a 30 or piss me off I reserve the right to draw a peep on your ballot. Sorry for any typos or grammar fuck ups. Also for my speaker points do in a sense represent skill not how pretty you talk so if you like can speak beautifully but can't argue worth crap don't expect any high speaks.


FOR BLAKE- So I have only judged one tournament all year and I was put in novice....so yeah speed probably will be somewhat of an issue hopefully I can be better by the end of the tournament. Also this topic is really really awkward but if you have an interesting take go for it.

For Blake (cont'd)
You should strike me if....
1. your strategy revolves a lot around theory interps like "aff must run a plan"
2. you run disclosure theory
3. you are really really unclear
4. you can not explain arguments well and do crystalization as well as line by line debate
5. you debate
Moral of the story: STRIKE ME I DO NOT WANNA JUDGE

Conflicts: Saint Louis Park, Hopkins.
