Though likely impossible, I will try my hardest to put aside any predispositions to decide your debate. I don't care much about the specifics of what you say or how you say it as long as it is not morally reprehensible or a violation of misconduct policies (cheating, clipping, harassment, etc.). Hard work, thorough research, and effective performances will result in high speaker points. 

Debate is a difficult activity but sometimes the stress is overwhelming - being overly aggressive or mean makes it less enjoyable for all of us.
