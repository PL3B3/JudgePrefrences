  Debated four years at SMS, currently a Freshman debating at KU.

Important things:-Read whatever arguments you are best at. I do my best to be objective and I will vote for any argument if you win it-Tech > truth. A conceded argument is a true argument, but you still need to impact it out. "Aff concedes no v2l" is not sufficient. You should extend the claim, the warrant, and the implication of the argument-I am not very familiar with the topic. I do not coach for any high school and my judging on this topic has been limited to prelims of the JDI-With paperless, prep stops when you are done preparing the speech doc. You do not need to use prep to email or save the file to the jump drive.

Arguments:

Topicality - These debates should be handled like a counterplan-disad debate. You should have disads to the other team's interpretation and an explanation of how the interpretation that you are advancing solves their disads. 

Case debate - Do it. You should collapse to a few main arguments for each case page in the block.

Disads - They are best when the outweigh and turn the case.

Counterplans - I will vote for them. Most theoretical objections to counterplans are reasons to reject the argument not the team. Word PICs are pretty meh

Kritiks: I think they're a pretty good strategy and I enjoy going for them. It is very important that your arguments are explained in context of the affirmative. Reading a bunch of generic security K blocks will probably not win you the round. Framework arguments that say kritiks are cheating are not very persuasive.
Critical affirmatives: You do not need a plan text to win the round, but you should have a good justification for why that's true in the context of your affirmative/the topic
