  Paul Wagner - Policy Judging Paradigm
I have coached high school debate for four years. I’m familiar with all events. I’m not comfortable with speed but won’t vote against you if you insist on debating fast unless the opposition runs a theory argument against you. I think spewing makes you sound dumb and ruins good debate, so I’d be happy to vote for anyone who points that out in round.

I’ll vote on any well presented T or theory argument.

I will vote on K, but the framework has to be bulletproof. I won’t vote for ridiculous or stupid framework and I’m wary of extreme impacts. In order for me to buy your nuclear war or human extinction impact, you’ll need to make a pretty strong link to the point that when I leave the round I’m honestly concerned that if your plan doesn’t pass we’re probably heading for disaster.

Don’t just read through your evidence and expect that to suffice. I’d much rather hear you analyze the evidence and support your arguments. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. I hate when rounds turn into a glorified game of Pokemon where one card beats another and the winning team revels in their nerdly glory that they had the more powerful card.

I’m not too strict on dropped arguments. Don’t expect to get my vote if you speed through an argument in the 1AR and bring it up every speech simply by saying, “Extend my argument.” I will only vote on the arguments that are argued in round. If someone legitimately drops an argument, it needs to be pointed out and explained why your arguments still stands.

I appreciate courtesy and diplomacy in round, but I also like to hear conviction and passion in your arguments. Try to find the balance. I think dress, presentation, and self-expression are important in debate and if all other arguments end in a wash, I will vote for the best dressed/presented team (this has never happened, but don’t rule it out).
