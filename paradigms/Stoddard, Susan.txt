  I am a lay (parent) judge. My son competed in Public Forum debate for 2 years and has just recently started competing in LD. 

I researched judging paradigms and found the following article helpful.

Based on this classification, I employ the "critical listener" approach since I put great weight on quality of the argument and effectiveness in delivery, including careful listening/responding to an opponent's argument. I am not grounded in the technical aspects of LD discussed in the article above. Please feel free to slot me as a judge with the novice group if you prefer to use judges with formal training for varsity competitors.
