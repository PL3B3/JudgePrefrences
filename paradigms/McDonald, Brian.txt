   I debated for three years at New Trier High School in Illinois, and have taught at the National Symposium for Debate.  I am now an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.

I vote on arguments, not on rhetoric or speaking ability. Arguments that you wish to use to win should be cleanly articulated and extended (claim, warrant, and impact) in every speech, and should be compared and weighed against your opponent’s arguments.  Make sure you establish a value criterion and relate all of your arguments to that criterion.  If you have an alternative to a criterion, explain how and why it functions:  merely labeling something as a burden or “a priori” does not make it automatically important.

I have no problem with speed as long as you can remain coherent.  If you are going too fast I will say clear, then clear again, and then I will stop flowing.  Much more important than speed is signposting.  If I don’t know where you are on the flow, it doesn’t matter how fast or slow you are talking.

I have no problem with K’s, theory and non-traditional arguments, but they should be warranted and clearly explained, like any other argument.

Other than that, be respectful and have fun.
