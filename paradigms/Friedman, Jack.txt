  Jack Friedman: Parent Judge from Half Hollow HS East, Dix Hills, Long island, New York.
I’ve been juding for about 4 years now, however, my experience primarily lies in regional debating. As such, I’m a very “lay” judges. Speed reading is not my preference; speak slowly and clearly, and you’ll do fine with me. As far as theory goes- unless you want to spend time both explaining your theory and what theory is to me, don’t use it. I don’t vote on it, so just stick to straight case argumentation. The same applies with Kritiks. I accept disads , but keep counter-plans from getting crazy- don’t make five links just to get to one point. In all, I vote on straight point-by-point argumentation, I like to keep arguments to direct links with the resolution, I am a non-interfering judge, and I want you to tell me why you should win, specifically. Don’t expect me to do the work for you.
