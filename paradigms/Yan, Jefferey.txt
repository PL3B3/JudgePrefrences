Background: Debated for 4 years in high school, debating in college now

5. dont steal prep it makes me feel so dirty when i have to call you out
6. dont say things that can be offensive/racist/sexist/anthropocentric (lol)
7. women are not guys

K/K Affs: this is my jam, did it all in high school/college, super familiar with anthro literature, cap, blackness, nietzsche. less familiar with more "out there" Ks like psych and deleuze so i ask you dont throw big words at me. k affs are dope, i think they have a lot of potential to change debate, i just ask for a ROTB or explanation of what the aff does so i can vote for something. i think a big problem with k debates is that alternatives are not explained properly; spending a good minute or 2 in the block to explain it is solid enough for me. obv i dig specific links to aff - the more specific the doper.

T: theyre alright, not a favorite but ill evaluate it. i expect lots of interp analysis and explanation of standards

DA: dont care much for these, but ill obviously evaluate them - the weakest part i often find of most disads are internal links - i think these should be fleshed out in order for you to win a risk of an impact. again, specific links are dope
ptx da: these are bad for education. when u read a politics disad everyone loses. ill evaluate it if you want me to but u disappoint me.

CP: not a fan at all, i think 90% of these debates end up being ridiculously confusing. that being said, go for it; i really look for specific net benefits and concrete forms of competition. just please explain how the cp functions in relation to the aff bc otherwise these debates get real confusing real fast.
