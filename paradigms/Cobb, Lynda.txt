  I coach both middle and high school PFD. I was a policy debater.

My judging philosophies are simple. Clash, persuade, funnel. I prefer clash and love a flashy cross. I don’t mind observations, but don’t give me a ten-pointer and apply it to every argument. I can flow a spread, but they tend to be less persuasive. If you can spit out 8 words a second and persuade me, all the power to you. I do flow. Summary speech is the most important speech in the round- funnel the arguments down. If it is not in Summary, I tend not to vote on it. In Final Focus, tell me why your voters win the day. 

As far as I am concerned, you are amazing for getting up early on a weekend to throw words at me. It bodes well for your future. Please be kind to one another, but brutal in your argumentation. Bonus points for humor, but you won’t necessarily win on it.
