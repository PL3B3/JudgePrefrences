  A little background on me: I debated for four years in high school, my first 3 being in LD and the last in PF. I am okay with speed, but if you're going too fast I’m not going to write anything down. Basically don’t spread on me, I don’t like it. I came from a very traditional debate school, so if you're going to run Ks, plan/counter plans, or obscure cases, explain it well. I really like sign posting. MAKE SURE YOU SIGN POST. If you’re going to flow something through, still summarize what you're flowing through. Theory is fine. Tell me impacts of your arguments. Give me voters. If there are more questions you have don’t hesitate to ask before the round.
