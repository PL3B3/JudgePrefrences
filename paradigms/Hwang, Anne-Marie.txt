  I debated LD for four years (2011-2015) at The Hockaday School (Dallas, TX), and I currently attend Stanford. I am an assistant coach at The Harker School. I debated on the national and local circuit and went to the TOC and TFA State.

Update 12/17/16: Make K args (especially links) super clear please.

Speed: Go as fast as you want, as long as you are clear. Slow down for short analytics, interps, counterinterps, plan texts, counterplan texts, and alt texts.

Philosophy: I love, love, love framework. Make sure your chain of logic is sound. A pet peeve of mine is when you are really well-versed in philosophy, but you can't explain anything to your opponent. Don't assume people know as much about your framework as you do.

Theory: I like theory debates. I don't believe in OCIs, so remember to win the RVI. I default drop the argument and competing interps.

Plans/CPs/DAs/Ks: I'm honestly not your best judge. I default theory > K, so if there is a K and a theory shell in the round, make sure to give reasons why I should evaluate the K first.

Tricks: As long as I understood it in the first speech, I'll vote for it. Make sure the impact is clear in the first speech. If the impact (e.g., dropping this spike means drop the debater) is new in the second speech, I'll let the other debater respond to it. Tricks can be smart, but if you have about 60 floating spikes, I will be very frustrated, and your speaks will suffer.

Speaker points: If I say "clear" or "slow" more than 5 times, you're getting a 25, and I will probably vote for your opponent unless they're more unclear than you. Be polite! If you effectively use sass, you will get a 30. I like debaters with personality.

Have fun! :)
