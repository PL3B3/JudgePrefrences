  I am the assistant coach at Sioux Falls Lincoln High School. I have been coaching debate for over 40 years in South Dakota.

I am a judge who prefers and really likes the stock issues. I am a communications person through training and at heart. I want good, clean, clear communication from the debaters. If you expect me to vote for something different from the stock issues, then it must be clear for me to understand and follow.

I do not like speed as it destroys any attempt at clear communication. I will listen to counterplans and DA's. Do not run a kritik in front of me unless you are willing to go slow and communicate it very clearly.

I would be considered old school too most debaters today, but I believe in the tradition of debate.
