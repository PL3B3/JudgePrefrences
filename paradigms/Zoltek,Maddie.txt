  I am a Junior Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry major at Yale. I have some familiarity with debate although I have never competed myself. I am not comfortable with speed or jargon, as communication and clarity is as important as technical skill and argument content in a debate round. 

I am familiar with the basics of the Lincoln Douglas format but don't know anything about more complex argument formats (like theory, kritiks, counter plans, etc.). However, I have nothing against arguments like that as long as they are very clearly explained. Basically, if you want arguments to function a certain way, like precluding certain arguments, or altering the role of the ballot, you need to be very explicit from the beginning about the function of the argument. If it is not clear to me, I will not feel comfortable voting on it. 

Have fun and enjoy the round and don't be rude or I will dock speaker points (although I'm sure that won't be a problem!).
