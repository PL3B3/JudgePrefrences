  I classify myself as a parent judge. My daughter competes in primarily LD and PF for Bonita High School and I have been a judge at several of tournaments and invitationals, including out rounds in PF, LD, Policy, and Parli at Jack Howe, Fullerton, and Stanford, as well as at the CHSSA state championships last year. 

Debate is about communication. I'm a human being, not a depository for information. Ergo, don't speed (alteration of your natural vocal pitch, double breathing, lack of eye contact, etc). If you speed, I won't flow. If I don't flow your argument, it doesn't exist.

I'll accept any argument if you provide warrants and impacts. Arguments without warrants won't fly. Arguments without impacts are unimportant.

I'll answer any specific questions before the round.
