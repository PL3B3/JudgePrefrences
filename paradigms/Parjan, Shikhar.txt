  Hello, I am a parent judge for Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, CA. This is my 1st year judging. I have judged at various local invitationals and league tournaments. I have never competed in LD, but I think it is an excellent way for students to talk about real-world issues outside of school.





 Speed: Conversational speed is probably best. It's probably a BAD idea to spread, I will not be able to flow it.



 Presentation: Try to be persuasive. I won’t base my decision on your speaking abilities, but I still think debate is a communicative activity, and I will very much like it if you give clear, coherent, and persuasive speeches. I also like perceptual dominance, but not to the point where you are being rude. 



 Theory: I know absolutely nothing about theory. I have a high threshold for abuse and I will not be compelled by these arguments. 



 Kritiks: I don’t know about critical literature and I do not understand the structure of these arguments, so I am not receptive to these positions. 



 Philosophy: Be clear when you are explaining your framework and how it functions. I do not understand complex framework arguments. I like contentions much more than lengthy frameworks. 



 Off cases: I tend to get confused about these. The more paper you make me use, the more confusing the round becomes. Probably not the best idea to run these in front of me. 





 WHAT I LIKE:



 -CLEAR signposting. SLOW DOWN for author names and taglines.

 -Not too fast pace

 -Intelligent, thoughtful arguments. Don't be offensive to your opponent. This is debate, and kids should feel safe.

 -Weighing analysis. I love this. You can't have too much of it. 

 -Crystallization - this will be key in whether I vote for you.





 WHAT I DON'T LIKE:



 -Fast, incoherent speeches

 -Rudeness

 -Debaters who get mad because I didn't understand their arguments. It's your job to be as clear as possible. Educate me!



 I don't disclose. Good luck!
