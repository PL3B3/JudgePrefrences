  Zip Edwards’ Judging Philosophy

Background:
Parent Volunteer/Trial Attorney

General Overview:

Clarity and pace in delivery of speech are extremely important. Spreading/speaking too quickly should be avoided. It is important for me to be able to make note of your value premise, value criterion, and the tag lines of your contentions. Clear articulation of your arguments is very important. I am not looking for a particular “style”; the substance of your argument is more important to me.

Value & Value Criteria:

Define the specific nature and boundaries of your value. Be clear about the reasoning behind your choice of the value and why this is the most important value in the round. There should be a clear link between your value and criterion. If your value is the same as your opponent’s, it is important for you to demonstrate why your criterion and contentions better uphold the value.

Evidence/Argument:

Please provide clear evidence supporting your claim. Give more substance to your claim by presenting tangible evidence/real world examples to support your contentions. Make substantial and organized arguments. To the extent possible, identify specific aspects of your opponent’s argument which are refuting.

Likes & Dislikes:

Likes – clear voting issues, good speakers, eye contact, good (not too rushed) pace, politeness
Dislikes – speaking too quickly, lack of concrete/real world evidence
