  I am a public high school teacher and Lincoln-Douglas debate coach in North Carolina.
I have no high school or college debate experience. However, I participated in Mock Trial while in law school and then worked as a trial attorney for several years before returning to teaching, so I have heard my share of arguments.
My personal philosophy regarding Lincoln-Douglas debate is just that, my personal philosophy. I don’t presume to tell any other person (except perhaps my students) how to debate Lincoln-Douglas. I think the diversity of styles of debate in Lincoln-Douglas is one of its strengths. There is no “right” or “wrong” way to argue Lincoln-Douglas, in my opinion. However, there are more and less effective methods of persuasion, generally. Debaters should adhere to the most effective methods of persuasion possible.
I feel bound to judge each round according to only the resolution and the arguments presented in the round. I set aside personal opinions, prior knowledge, and all other external concerns. I attempt to begin each round tabula rasa. It is the debater’s sole task to persuade the judge to affirm or negate the resolution. The debater can and should approach this task in whatever manner she or he deems best. However, I would suggest ideas are most persuasive when clear and cogent to the listener. I also believe Lincoln-Douglas debate requires a clash of values.
I expect participants in high school debate to treat all persons with respect, courtesy, and civility. It is possible to zealously disagree with an individual’s opinion on an issue, while still treating the individual with utmost respect. I know this to be true, because I have witnessed it firsthand while observing great advocates in the courtroom. Win or lose, high school debate should be fun for everyone.
