  4 years of high school experience in circuit policy debate, currently a coach for James Logan high school. I really have no preference as to what types of arguments are made, I enjoyed a well-impacted theory debate in high school just as much as politics or the cap k. Speaker points will mainly be based off of argumentation and strategic choices.
