  Experience: 4 years High School competitor, 7 years High School coach. Judged LD at nationals, 2015.

Preferences: I am not very fond of Policy oriented arguments in LD, but will listen to just about anything so long as you provide a clear reason for me to vote. 

Clash is critical in any debate format, try to avoid the "two ships pass in the night" debate where neither side engages with the other. 

Tell me how to vote and why.

Lastly, Debate is a communication activity, if your speed prevents you from communicating, not much of what you say will make it onto my flow.
