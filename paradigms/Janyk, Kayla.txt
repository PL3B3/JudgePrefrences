  I did policy debate for four years in high school at Sehome and Bellingham High Schools.

I will vote on anything. I especially love good arguments. I like critiques and case specific PICs and disads and theory and impact turns and just about anything else. I used to love topicality debates but I have yet to judge any rounds on this topic. Please do not be violent.
