  I debated LD for four years at Scarsdale high school, graduating in 2012. I competed on the national circuit and won the Glenbrooks and broke at the TOC.

I believe that it is the job of the debaters to provide a logical basis to justify me signing the ballot one way or another. All types of argumentation are de facto valid until they are contested by an opponent. My primary goal is to evaluate the flow as objectively as possible so as to avoid intervention.

As a debater I gravitated toward more philosophical positions, so I am well-equipped to evaluate such debates. However, I am open to listening to just about anything. Since I loathe intervention, weighing, comparison, and a clear articulation of the prioritization of arguments (i.e layering) is of utmost importance. 

I award speaker points primarily based on strategy, efficiency, and the logical and clear exposition of arguments. I also will adapt my speaks based on the norms and quality of the tournament.

My judging philosophy is very similar to that of Emily Massey, please see her page for more information.
