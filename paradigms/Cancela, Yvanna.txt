  I am not a picky judge - in fact I will gladly listen to any argument, and will likely even vote on almost any argument.

That said, here's what I think about certain arguments.

Topicality
I don't think "potential abuse" is a good or compelling argument. If you want to win this debate, the focus needs to be on comparing terminal impacts, and explaining your interpretation versus theirs in this framework.

Counterplans
PICS are just fine. Conditional PICS maybe not as fine. Conditionality on its own, probably not that bad.

Kritiks
Explain your alternative. Have a clear impact story. Specificity is much more persuasive to me than throwing out every K word you know.

Impact comparison is clutch here for both sides. I'm big on turns case arguments.
