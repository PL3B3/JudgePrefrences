  Hey, I debated for Westlake high school in Texas, and I'm currently at Berkeley. I ran the K more than the CP+Da, but I'll listen to any argument, I'll listen to any way the debate should be evaluated or viewed. I default to offense/defense within reason, I like arguments to be fewer smarter, and comparative, instead of numerous cards without warrants that are spewwed into a vacuum.
