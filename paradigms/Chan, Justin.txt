  Debated for 4 years (2006-2010) at James Logan High School, and now currently at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (aka nothing close to debate). I would boil down my "judging philosophy" to 3 key points - feel free to ask me further questions if you have any.

[1] I'm open to any arguments not racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.
[2] I tend to default to competing interpretations on topicality, as I'm under the impression that reasonability, even at its best, is arbitrary. I would attribute this to the fact that I went for T a lot. I guess I'm more sympathetic to voting on theory than others would be. I used to think that the NEG could get away most with most things, but now I'm not so sure.
[3] I'm not -very- familiar with most kritik literature (read: I'm not), so if you're going to read a very nuanced, specific kritik, be sure to invest good time in the explanations.
