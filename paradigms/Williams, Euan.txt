  I'm open to new ideas. As long as I can understand you and there is logic, reasoning, or other support to an argument, it should be acceptable. But here are some other notes that may help you better understand my paradigm. 

- I was a very traditional LD debater in high school, meaning, I prefer speaking to be deliberate rather than extremely fast. I prefer quality of arguments over quantity. 
- I am familiar with more progressive approaches like Krtitks, Counterplans, and even some Theory, but again, I am very traditional. Of the three though, I do like a good theory every once and a while.
- I do prefer a framework with which to weigh a round and relish a good framework debate.
- Impacts should be tangible. Though I will have an open-mind to extensive link chains, they also will be harder for me to buy.
- Sign-posting is very important.
- Other than that, feel free to ask questions before the round.
