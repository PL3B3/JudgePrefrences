  Judging paradigm for Karen Keefer

I have coached Speech and Debate for 15 years and conduct judge training on behalf of the Coast Forensic League. Although I currently coach speech events, I do still judge LD, Public Forum and Parli at invitationals and at State.

I flow all rounds, however I cannot listen and write fast enough to keep up with high-speed debate. Moderate speed is okay as long as I can clearly understand you and flow your arguments. If I can’t understand you, I will call “clear.”

I’m okay with framework debate and overviews, but am not a fan of rounds that primarily focus on the rules of debate, or why I should a priori reject your opponent’s side of the debate. Nor do I care for a lot of arguing over definitions. I like good clash, clearly-stated arguments, credible evidence well-linked to contentions through analysis, and (for LD) clear links back to your standards.

I understand some jargon, but new terms creep in every year and I may not be up on the latest, so please explain yourself rather than depending on jargon shorthand.
