  I debated for Torrey Pines HS (CA) for four years, graduating in 2012. I qualified to the TOC my senior year.

The last tournament I judged at was Yale 2014; don't expect me to be up-to-date about "what's hot" in debate. In fact, I'm not eveb that great at flowing anymore either, but I'll shout "clear" or "speed" if necessary.

I'll evaluate any type of argument as long as it's complete (claim, warrant impact). Debate is your game, so play it how you want--just be straight up about your strategies; there's should be no need to hide anything. In my RFD, I should be able to coherently explain your arguments similar to how you articulated them in round. 

Miscellaneous:

- 2NR/2AR Overviews are good. Do them.
- Understanding how to use uniqueness
- Topic specific debate
- Creativity in argument generation
- Messy theory debates are bad. If this happens, I might evaluate the debate in ways you may not agree with, so don't blip-spread. Theory's analytical nature demands more argument development, not less. 
- Have fun when you debate. It's nice seeing students do an activity they genuinely love.
