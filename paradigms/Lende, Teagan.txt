  I'll vote on any argument as long as you can substantiate it. I debated on a traditional-style circuit in high school, so I am most comfortable with Value/Criterion debate. However, you shouldn't read too deeply into my background, as it won't bias my opinions on different forms of argumentation. My one bias is against theory arguments, but I will still vote on them if you win the argument in the round. Nonetheless, I have a higher bar for accepting theory. Otherwise, I vote on the flow and enjoy hearing strong voting issues at the end of your argument. I can flow a bit of speed, but I won't be able to keep up with the fastest speakers. I will let you know if you're going too fast or not speaking clearly enough.
