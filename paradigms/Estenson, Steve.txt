  I am pretty basic in my philosophy. 

I have judged LD since its inception in 1976. 

While I listen to and flow values/criteria/standards issues, I rarely vote on them alone.

I want clash on the issues as raised in the cases. I listen for source citations. Dates can be significant when dealing with recency of events/policies.

One word does not an argument make, even in rebuttals. You need to do more than just say what your opponent said and then repeat what you had said. In light of your opponent's, why how is your position still superior? 

Speed is an issue only if the speaker becomes incoherent or incomprehensible.
