I enjoy debate, I believe it is a forum in which different schools of thought can clash and ultimately create new forms of education/knowledge/etc.
Do what you want. The debate should be your time to show out. I will vote on any argument, and evidence isn’t necessarily required or even preferred. I guess an easier way to explain my judging style is to isolate a couple of judges who I enjoyed in high school: Edmund Zagorin, Yao Yao Chen, Philip DiPiazza
While I’m completely open to any style of debate, I would be lying if I said I didn’t have any preferences. I lean more towards the kritikal side of debate, however, I love policy debates where specific strategies are deployed, i.e. a sweet advantage counterplan, some specific impact turns, a case specific DA, whatever. Like most people in the community, I believe debating the case, whether policy or affirmative, is really important, but also very underutilized in high school. If you can utilize case strategically and/or make it an important part of your negative strategy, I will reward you with high speaker points.
Specific questions can be asked in round, but yes, I’m down for K affirmatives, Topicality (a better argument than framework in my opinion), Framework, counter-plans, kritiks, whatever.
At the end of the day, the debate comes down to you. You do what you feel best doing, and I will evaluate all strategies equally.
