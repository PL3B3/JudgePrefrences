  Background: I debated policy and public forum for four years in high school. I graduated in 2010 and am now in college, but not debating there.

Philosophy: I am a real-world impacts judge. I want you to emphasize why your impacts outweigh and how you best solve for the impacts in the round. I prefer not to see K's but will vote for them if I have to. Same goes for T arguments.

Basically, I will vote for the best team in the round based on their impact calculus.

Read clearly. Debate well. Have fun.
