  Background: debated at the woodlands, followed my best friend Abbey Chapman to national tournaments for two years :')
I judge in the New Orleans area for Isidore Newman

a few things

Ks/skep/theory/fw/plans/cp/da etc-
yeah probably just dont. didnt debate ld in hs but im required to make this so just assume i know slightly more than the average lay judge. if u get super technical i promise u it will go straight over my head. if you're going to read theory in front of me i guess i default to a question of competing interps. but i will not be happy about it. also i will probably be super confused.

speed-
slow down on tags and author names
If you see me not flowing then I don't know what you're saying and you should probably slow down

misc-
-if you read a position that is potentially triggering please give trigger warnings. if you're not completely sure what you're reading necessitates a trigger warning just give one anyway. if someone in the room has an objection to your position the expectation is that the debater won't read that position and adjust accordingly
-tell me where to vote
-high speaks if u make me laugh/sit down early
-don't tell me that extinction is good, oppression is good etc i won't vote on it
-i will drop u if you're racist/sexist/homophobic in round
-i will tank ur speaks if you're clearly a more experienced debater mercilessly destroying a novice in round. no one likes to watch that. do not be that person who is spreading and reading like 5 theory shells against a novice debater. im also probably not the judge u should be reading theory in front of anyways.

if u have any more questions u can ask me before the round but i cant guarantee that i will have have a strong opinion on anything
