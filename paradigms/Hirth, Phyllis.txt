      I expect the debaters to present their arguments in a clear and understandable manner.  Clarity and communication to the judge is paramount.  I also expect each speaker to address the topic.  Give me a criteria on which you want me to judge the round and Value premise is necessary in a values debate.  I do not like critiques or definitional debates and enjoy a round with good, clear cut clash. 
    I have been a coach and judge for 25 years.  At present I do not coach but I do judge several times a year.
