I prefer that debaters refer to, and develop, stock issues: harm, significance, causality, inherency,
solvency, workability, advantages, and disadvantages.
Needs, comparative advantage, criteria, and alternative-justification cases are all acceptable.
I don’t care for kritik negative cases. Only the announced resolution is to be debated.
Debaters should argue topicality only if the affirmative case is clearly non-topical.
Counterplans must be (a) mutually exclusive with the affirmative plan, and (b) extra-topical (otherwise
affirmative may adopt negative counterplan as a permutation of the resolution).
I expect debaters to speak well. I refuse to reward rapid-fire delivery and sucking air.
I don’t care for the “spread.” I would much prefer fewer arguments that are well developed and well-
spoken than a bunch of poorly developed arguments.
I prefer to judge on stock issues, of which the affirmative must win all. If the issues are not clear, as is
often the case with novice debaters, I will judge who had the best debating technique – delivery,
argument, evidence, analysis, refutation, and organization.
I expect debaters to be friendly with each other. Insults and caddiness are unacceptable.
