  I am currently the Coach at Plano East Senior high.
I am a Policy guy, but I enjoy all the different types of debate.
CX: I am open to almost anything. I dont mind speed as long as you can be understood. I love K's, CP's, DA's etc. not a stock issues kind of guy. Nothing is a voter when I walk in...you have to make it one.
LD: I am open to the style of LD, and will always look at things through a policy mindset. I do expect some Value type argument, but will vote on almost anything
PF: Just remember I am a CX guy, so I will view through those blinders
