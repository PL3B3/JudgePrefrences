I’m not very familiar with theory so it would probably be unwise to run it. BUT you can make any unorthodox argument you want and I’ll listen as long as you can convince me and pull it off well. Most important thing is clarity. I’ll vote for the person who can explain their arguments well and make it most clear why I should be voting for them. Keep weighing throughout the round. I prefer explicit weighing. Point out all the implications of arguments you make and extend well, emphasizing the important stuff.

Don’t spread TOO fast but you can speak fast to an extent as long as you’re not losing clarity.

CX is really important. If you have a really strong case, but can’t show why you should win, you probably won’t win the ballot.

Speaker points: I don’t really like aggressively or relentlessly trying to force your opponent, during CX, that you must win the round if you do one certain thing. Show me why I should vote for you, don’t try to force me to vote a certain way or off a certain thing. Be respectful to your opponent.

If you have any questions, you can ask me.
