  I debated throughout High School and College. In College I was mainly participated Policy Debate and a much less technical version, Ethics Debate. 

As a judge, I typically do not buy into the theory arguments, especially Topicality. 

I am open to nearly any and all arguments, and judge based off of the flow. That being said, you may speak, or mumble as fast as you would like, however, if I can't understand you then it will not make it onto my flow and therefore will not be used to evaluate the round. I am currently in law school, and have not been around fast speaking debaters in some time, so be forewarned. 

As a Policy debater, I am comfortable with Dis-ads, CPs and Ks so feel free to run these in your LD rounds.

If you plan on running a Performance K, I will be amused and will probably be very entertained, but there will be little to nothing on my flow and therefore your likelihood of winning the round is severely diminished.

Give me voters and reasons to prefer your arguments over the other team's.

Most importantly, good luck and have fun!
