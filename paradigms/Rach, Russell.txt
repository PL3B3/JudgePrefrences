  I am the policy debate coach at Bellaire High School. Have been for several years. coaching high school debate for 12 years. Currently in law school. enjoy a good clash of argument. enjoy depth-filled discussion. research. variety. creativity. ability to transcend jargon and communicate beyond the immediate sphere of pure policy debate influence. respect debaters that go out of their way to increase likelihood of good clash. this goes beyond plan disclosure. Think  negative disclosure. Also like teams adapting for their colleagues, choosing speed that is inclusive, reduction of rhetoric and jargon that excludes, and modification of strategy to increase optimal performance by your opponent. Being civil. Really.

Am willing to TRY to evaluate ALL arguments and approaches. My default settings / presumptions are that: 1.negative counterplans should be limited to the same or lesser fiat agent as the affirmative, affirmatives must be marginally topical, fewer normative operating assumptions (plans, CPs, perms) increase clash and likelihood of predictive literature, and Barak Obama is better than john McCain. I love negative teams that can defy gravity and win the round with a self-contained negative case strategy, and am willing to cut them a presumptive break / risk calculation to subsidize the likelihood of such an educationally significant supernova event. 


"The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!" - Jack Kerouac, On the Road.
