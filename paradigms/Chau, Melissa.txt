  I’ve debated 4 years for Lake Highland Prep (Class of 2017). 
  
 I will evaluate the round as best as I can based off of the flow. My best advice to get my ballot is to tell me where to vote and weigh (the way to win is to weigh way more). I honestly just want the round explained well.
 Please extend offense explicitly in your speeches (Claim, warrant, impact). I will not evaluate any offense that isn't extended into your next speech.
  
 On another note, I think debate is whatever you make of it- if you want it to be a game, educational space, performance, whatever, it is up to you. Have fun, but please be kind to your opponent.
 My level of comfort goes: 
 1. Ks
 2. Philosophy 
 3. LARP 
 4. T/Theory
 Don’t let what I put discourage you from doing what you like, just know that you’ll have to do more crystallization as you move down the list. 
  
 Other things:
 - I might make faces; I might not. It depends how reactive I feel- don’t take any of it personally. 
 - Please slow down for analytics; my flowing skills are poor
 - Do not be offensive (sexist, racist, ableist, etc.); it’s just human decency.
