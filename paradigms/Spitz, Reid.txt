Background: I debated for four years in high school in congress, PF, and LD and was a PF/LD captain at Cherry Creek High School in Englewood, CO my senior year. I was competitive mainly on the local circuit, placing highly in many tournaments in the state of Colorado, including the state championship tournament and nat-quals. 

Paradigms: It seems to me that every kind of debate on the national circuit is slowly turning into CX-- which I hate. Don't get me wrong, I think CX is a great event, but the speed and style make it very exclusive. Unfortunately, PF and LD are becoming this way as well-- more evidence-based and less argument-based than ever. PF was created out of the need to create a more "lay" debate, but it's quickly becoming as inaccessible as CX. When I judge a PF/LD round, I like to see supporting evidence, sure, but more than anything I want convincing arguments. The whole debate should not become, "my evidence says..." "well my evidence says...", etc. Give me arguments as to why you're right, not just tons of cards that say you are. Along the same lines, I don't particularly like spreading, but I do sometimes understand the need for it at times in the round (not the entire round, though). On the whole, remember that the purpose of LD, and particularly PF debate, is to convince me, the judge, that you're right. The bottom line is that debate is supposed to improve your ability to persuade people...so persuade me with impressive rhetoric, logical arguments, and supporting evidence. I'm also a tabula rasa judge, so somewhere in your final speech, give me a reason to vote for you. Be clear to outline where you are on the flow throughout the debate so I can keep track of the round easily. 

Ballots: I try to give a lot of feedback on ballots so debaters know where they can improve.

Good Luck!
