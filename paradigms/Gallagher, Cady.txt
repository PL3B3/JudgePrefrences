I am completely fine with flowing speed, but only if you are clear. If your speed starts to compromise your clarity and I can't understand what you're saying, your speaker points will suffer and I obviously won't be able to justify voting on anything I couldn't understand.I am not opposed to hearing or voting on theory, but only if it is relevant. It's frustrating when debaters run theory for the sake of running theory, so make sure that you only run theory in front of me when it is relevant; I won't vote for unnecessary arguments. On the same general subject, I am not opposed to RVI's, but again, only when they make sense.In terms of speaker points, being rude, making offensive or unnecessary arguments, and sacrificing persuasion for speed are all things that will hurt you. Also, I am not opposed to giving low point wins.I am fairly well versed in philosophy and typical debate arguments, but it's probably safest for you to give a significant amount of background on any complex arguments so as not to risk me not understanding what you're saying. I cannot justify voting on an argument that I don't understand, so it is the burden on the debaters to make sure their positions are very clear.
If you have any other specific questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
