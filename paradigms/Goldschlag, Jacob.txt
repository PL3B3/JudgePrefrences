  I am a junior Michigan Man and i'm have plenty of high school/college policy debate experience.

here are some things i think about debate
1. CPLANs i dont think are a sufficiency thing but more of a yes/no question..does CPLAN more likely to --> DA? Is how I evaluate these debates......
2. kritics...........all i can say is you live by the sowrd you die by the sword
3. DDev was my favorite argument despite its ethically suspect connotations and assumptions
4. De-Fense ..... it's important in any debate but..why set the terms of ur own surrender?

other than that i am a pretty blank tabula rasa with a slight proclivity towards games-pplayer



seriously though use this, why would anyone use this wiki anymore?: https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml?search_first=&search_last=goldschlag
