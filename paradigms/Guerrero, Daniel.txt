  I will be in the Congress pool.
I competed in forensics in high school and now serve as my town's mayor. As such, I have a deep understanding of parliamentary procedure and how
a session such as Congress should run. When evaluating, I will be looking for the "total package" in that just giving good speeches is not enough. A
competitor must also be involved in the room and demonstrate knowledge of procedure. Canned speeches will not be scored well, as I am more interested
in seeing direct clash between contestants.
