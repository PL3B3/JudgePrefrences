  I debated for Ashland High School for 4 years and am back in debate because my daughter is debating for Nevada Union. 

I am most comfortable with negative strategies that involve disads, counterplans, case debate or topicality. I debated before the K was as big as it is now and I did not read Ks, so I am not very comfortable adjudicating them. I do not have a leaning either neg or aff on topicality.

I think the aff should probably defend implementation of a plan.
