  I am a parent judge. I have judged slow policy debate for three years. If you spread, it's very likely that I will miss a lot of what you say, and you will not be happy with your decision. I subscribe to the policymaker paradigm. I do not enjoy Kritiks, but Counterplans are okay as long as you are slow, finite and concrete about what the CP does, and explain why they are reasons to reject the affirmative.
