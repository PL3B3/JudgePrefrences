  My name is Anand Srinivasan. I have judged LD debate for some time now (since my son is active in the activity) and have a good understanding of the types of arguments that are run.

I am fine with most arguments, but do ask for each debater to speak slowly since I am not very good at understanding spreading. Also, I have a propensity to not vote on theory since I prefer for both debaters to think critically and make arguments on the substance flow. I also don’t like skep, but am fine with plans, counterplans, D/As, Ks, T (in most cases), etc. If you are reading a complex framework though, be very clear.
As a judge, I do appreciate good speaking and am pretty relaxed with speaker points (in most cases, I will probably give you a 29.5-30). Here is what I am looking for:

To get a 30 in speaks: be nice to your opponent (don’t be condescending in CX), speak properly, make arguments clear to understand and follow, and MAKE sure to signpost your arguments.
If you don’t meet a few of these points, I’ll probably give you a 28. If you don’t meet most of these points, I’ll give you a 27-27.5.
If you have any other questions, ask me before rounds.
