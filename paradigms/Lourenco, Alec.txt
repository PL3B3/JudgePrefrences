  I am a recent high school graduate who used to compete in a myriad of debate events, though I've not kept up with debate in recent times. Below are a few of my preferences:

1. Confidence is good, but arrogance is not. Please do not be condescending to your opponent(s) or me.
2. Please do not spread. I write slowly, so I will probably not get down all your arguments on my flow, nor understand them. If you see me struggling to write down everything you are saying on your flow, it is best to slow down.
3. I like unconventional arguments. If you can find an interesting way to argue a resolution or a clever way to define the resolution (that is still contestable) then I will be impressed.
4. For evidence, data and statistics (common knowledge) are preferable to anecdotes which are preferable to appeals to authority. Please use authoritative sources. I will look up facts and figures that seem suspicious. Making up information will not reflect well on one's speaker points or standing in the round.
5. Never forget the impacts of your arguments. This is how I will determine the relative weight each of your arguments will receive.
6. I will be very impressed with you if you can teach me something throughout the course of the debate.
7. Do not be afraid to drop arguments for the sake of maintaining clash. If you do not have a valid counterargument for another's argument, move on and show how your other arguments are more important than the dropped argument.
8. Have fun and don't worry about winning. I was never a "strong" debater in any of my events, but still learned a lot in the process and had a great time.
