  I debated for Hunter College High School for 3 years.

I am not a strictly tabula rasa judge-- if you make an argument I expect it to be backed up with a reasonable explanation. I prefer quality of arguments over quantity (I will flow speed but do not prefer it) and I rarely, if ever, vote on T. I also prefer to see a strong values debate in the round.

If you have additional questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
