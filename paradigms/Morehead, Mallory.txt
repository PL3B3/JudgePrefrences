I debated Lincoln-Douglas in high school and Policy for two years in college, so I am ok with speed as long as you are clear. When I debated policy I was a 2A.

I will vote on topicality, but that also does not guarantee a W if you read it. It is most important to me that arguments are developed well and well explained. I am not entirely familiar with kritiks, but have a base knowledge on the common ones.

I am ok with strong personalities in CX, but please be respectful. No screaming matches. Humor and movie references welcome.

I give high speaker points to people who execute arguments well and are persuasive in the debate.

I do not judge very frequently nor am I directly involved in coaching anyone.
