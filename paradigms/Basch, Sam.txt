  My style of judging LD is pretty simple:
I like to flow throughout the round to ensure that I see what arguments are attacked and which are dropped. I'm okay with spreading in so far as I can understand what the speaker is saying. I give them one warning to slow down and if I still cannot understand them, every argument that they attempt to carry while spreading and I cannot understand it, I give it no weight.
