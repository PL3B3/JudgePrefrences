  My name is Brock Sondrup, For anyone who doesn't know my background i debated for four years in high school then immediately began assistant coaching afterward. I debated in all areas policy, LD, public forum, and even parliamentary. (though i competed primarily in Lincoln Douglas.) I competed nationally and cleared at several larger tournaments. Now on to the specifics.


1- Impact calculus- i fully expect each debater to provide a thorough impact calculus at the end of each round, using time frame, magnitude, and probability. CLEARLY EXPLAIN THE INTERNAL LINKS of the impact!

2- Flow- I love to keep a very clean and organized flow, and i expect you to help me with this. Always remember to number, be clear on tags, and sign post effectively. I will expect to vote off the flow unless provided with a good theory argument not to. 

3- Courtesy - Dont be mean it makes me sad :( (that's a sad face). 

4- Theory - love it as long as it is run correctly and well

5- to be completely honest this is your round and you should be able to debate what you wish. I am fine with listening to Ks, CPs, DAs, Theory or any other argument your intelligent little mind can imagine. Here is what I am not fine with listening to, poorly formulated arguments. Simply put, you can run whatever you like, just run it well with strong advocacy.

6- speed - I am fine with it as long as your running legitimate postitions. do not go fast for the sake of going fast. I hate generic. be clear on tags. 

In summary: be smart, be nice, have fun. 

Feel free to ask me any specific questions before the round.
