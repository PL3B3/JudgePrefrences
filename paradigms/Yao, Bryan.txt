  I debated mostly PF on the Austin TFA circuit between 2011-2015. Am okay with speed as long as it's not too fast but prefer slower paces. Don't really like Ks/theory unless it's well explained. Prefer clear speaking, clear tags, good warrants, analysis, impact calc. Do the work for me. I am lazy and like trap music and sports.
