  Background: Debated for 4 years in Circuit debate. Have qualified to states. Was Captain of my debate team my senior year. 

Paradigm: I'm generally a laid back kind of judge who doesn't support interfere in the debate. This means that the debate has to be clear to me and I will judge based on what is on my flow. Clear extensions and organized clash are big points to me. Label your turns and extensions so I can easily follow you. I can handle speed well, however you need to enunciate your words clearly. If you are quiet, mumbling, and speaking at breakneck speed, I simply will not get your argument on the flow. I can handle spreading. but just do your best to be clear. I will yell clear once and only once. 

I am fine with any alternative arguments such as theory, counterplans, kritiks, etc... so long as they are completely logical. I judge mostly on the logistics of the debate and if you execute them right and stage clearly why these arguments are plausible in the debate. 

I will allow flex prep, but keep in mind that I treat cross-ex as a portal to interact with me, the judge, on what issues I ought to place with importance.

Overall, I'm a very flexible judge who likes a lot of clash. Make sure to respect each other in the debate as well.
