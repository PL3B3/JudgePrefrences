Policy Debate Paradigm

Experience:
3 years of high school CX debate
4 years college debate (One year CEDA, 3 years Parli – NPDA)
14 years high school debate coach (judged CX at nationals five years and LD three years)

Paradigm:
I tend to default to a policymaker paradigm, although I am open to other paradigms if they are clearly articulated and defended. I expect clear framework and voters on procedural and non-policy arguments (i.e. kritiks, and T) so that I understand if they are pre-fiat or post-fiat and/or a priori. I also prefer impact framework for kritiks and DAs so that I know how you want me to weigh them against any other impacts in the round. I am not opposed to K, in fact I like really good kritiks (though sometimes I have found they are not run very well and hence are harder to vote for), but remember that in the absence of clear framework arguments on K or voters on T, I will weigh the policy impacts according to the time frame, probability, and magnitude of each impact and vote accordingly. If you are clear about how the impacts and voters should be weighed in your rebuttals, you are significantly more likely to win my ballot. Good 2AR and 2NR speeches tell me the story of the round and why I should vote for you. If you have an overview or under view, your goal should be to clearly articulate what my RFD should be, which makes my job easier.

I am OK with speed - I am pretty used to it by now - but don’t mumble or slur your words together – articulate and efficient speed can be a good strategy; inarticulate spread fails to communicate your arguments. Remember, I'm usually not reading along with you as you spread and I need to be able to hear what you are saying.
