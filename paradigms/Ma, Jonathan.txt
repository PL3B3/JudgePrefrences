  Assistant LD Coach at Gabrielino High School (CA).

Background: 4 years LD (1999-2003).

I'm ok with speed, but appreciate going slower on complex arguments. I'll flow and extend blips when told to, but I'd consider it refuted by an appropriately unsubstantiated claim. Am not a fan of theory. I'd prefer more thoughtful argumentation over sheer quantity, but if extensions ultimately contribute to a compelling aff or neg thesis, I'll vote in your favor.

Do not bring up new arguments in the NC/2AR or say an argument went dropped when it wasn't.

Most important parts of the debate include standards, good warrants and voting issues. I'd like the debate to be summarized to me using various aspects of the flow to help me come to a conclusion on the round. Weighing is critical to evaluate the importance of arguments.

I've judge a couple of tournaments this year, and have seen some rude debaters. If you are rude, I will lower speaker points. If it is excessive, I will drop you.

This is very high level, so please feel free to ask in round.
