My name is Joel and I'm from California State Fullerton. I've been in debate for about 8 years. That being said, I know whats up in debate. I try to keep my poker face on during the round but I occasionally give particularly persuasive arguments a head nod or smirk of approval. That's just my style. I am a young guy from southern california who was lucky enough to be part of an urban debate league. I am now in the Masters Program at CSUF studying persuasion & rhetoric. I love the debate community and all of its chaos. Not the drama but I'm talking about the collection of geniuses in one place all at intellectual war with one another. Its quite the rush, isn't it?

My topics of interest include decoloniality (before it was cool), body politics, epistemology, globalization, power, culture, identity. I prefer critical arguments. I appreciate teams that take the time to explain things in detail. I feel lucky to be in the back of the room when debaters speak passionately about issues important to them. My decision at the end of the round will boil down to whichever team has control of the debate, demonstrates better control of the space, won the key parts of the debate and packages it up nicely for me.
