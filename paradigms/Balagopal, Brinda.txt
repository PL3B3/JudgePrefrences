  Here’s my philosophy on judging LD:
Signpost: Being a novice, it would be easier if you could please signpost your contentions, refutations and conclusions.
Speed: While speed is important, I prefer clear diction ~ so please don’t rush, “swallow” your words or sentences and finish your sentences.
Framework: While a framework is important, a values debate isn’t just about a framework. It needs supporting contentions and evidence.
Contentions: Please present a fully formed argument, with an assertion supported by a warrant. I would prefer if you didn’t support your contentions with quotes only. Please use evidence, or analogies or even logical reasoning to justify your stance.
Cross X: 
Be courteous to your opponent ~ while I enjoy a good clash, rudeness, name calling or yelling isn’t going to gain you any points. In fact it may lose you points. 
Be circumspect on how you choose to extend any important points from Cross X in your speeches.
Criterion/Standards: If you are using esoteric criterion or standards, I would appreciate it if you could take a couple of seconds to explain it and reference this through your contentions. I am looking for the link between your contentions and your criteria.
Finally, remember that you need to persuade me and that’s not the same as going after your opponent ☺
Have FUN.
