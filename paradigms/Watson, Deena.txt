  I have been judging LD and PF for the last couple of years. I come from a very traditional state when it comes to debate and tend to judge traditionally as well. I am very good at keeping my own opinions out of the round. To me it’s not so much the topic you are debating but more who argues their side the best. It’s all about clash for me. If misinformation is presented and you don’t point it out, I won’t judge on it. If your opponent opens a door it is your job to walk through that door and point it out to me. 
Framework: I work best with the more traditional arguments and I love V/C clash. I like it when you explain to me why yours is the best and can back it up with your contentions and evidence. I really like it when you can not only destroy your opponents VC, but can also flow it to your side, if it is warranted. 
Theory and Kritiks: As long as you don’t talk in code and explain it to me as if it were the first time I would be hearing it (as it might be) you will be okay. Remember, you have to convince me that your argument is better than your opponents. Don’t tell me how to judge but do tell me why I should be in favor of your side of the case and then back that up. Spell it out in terms I will understand. I can’t judge on something I don’t understand. Make sure you drive your points home. I am open to new ideas but really enjoy a good clash over strategies and tactics. Let’s debate!
Speed can be OK, as long as I understand the argument. But if you are bringing up a K or odd theory, talk slower so I can process the info.
