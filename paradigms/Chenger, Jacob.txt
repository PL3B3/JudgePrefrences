  I have 4 years of debate experience at Edmond Santa Fe High School competing in LD and PFD.
I am currently a freshman policy debater at The University of Central Oklahoma.
PFD:
 I believe public forum debate exists to persuade. I don't like seeing so much evidence and definition debate that we forget the topic. I'm pretty open to any sort of argumentation as long as the pro affirms the resolution and the con disagrees with the pro. I like the use of observations when used correctly, I think they keep the debate unique and interesting. Keep the debate fun and persuade me to vote for you.

LD:
 I only have a traditional LD debate background. Therefore, I am not very good with speed. I will try as hard as I can to keep up but if it isn't on my flow then you didn't say it. I do not like theory or dense frameworks. I want to see a good relevant framework debate while still seeing clear argumentation for why one side won over another. Stay topical and stay realistic.

Overall debate is suppose to be fun, don't get mad and don't yell. Be respectful and good luck!
