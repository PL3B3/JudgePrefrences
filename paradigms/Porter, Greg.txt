  I debated at La Salle for 3 years. I competed both nationally and locally. I currently coach La Salle’s policy debate team. Over my 3 years I have found most arguments in debate to be lacking any connection to reality. Luckily for you both sides will probably be running stupid arguments, so this won’t come in to my decision in the round. Even if you are running stupid impacts you should still try to challenge internal link chains in disads. I can be persuaded by a single defensive point on the flow. There is such a thing as a 100 percent defensive takeout. On the other side, 1ncs should consist of analytics against the case not just cards. That being said, I am a stock issues/policymaker. I can handle speed fine, but I would prefer a slower debate. One way to lose A LOT of speaker points is to be incomprehensible. You should just run good arguments.
