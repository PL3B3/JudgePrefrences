  I have been judging for 5 years now.

One thing I value above all else is politeness. Being polite will determine your speaker points.

Speed is not a major issue, but make sure to be clear and articulate all of your words.

I can follow progressive, but I prefer traditional and will probably be able to better understand if you do debate traditionally.
