Ohio Valley will be my first time judging a circuit tournament (I have observed circuit rounds). I have experience judging and coaching traditional debate – please understand my critiques and judging in light of this information.

Speed
¨ I prefer normal speed in LD to spreading, but by all means, if it is necessary, do so. I will do my best to keep up.
¨ I will not say clear – my intervention in the debate is unnecessary.
¨ Signposts and roadmaps are necessary.
¨ Speaker points suffer for those who are unclear.

Theory/kritiks
¨ I’m not an experienced judge of theory arguments or kritiks in LD; if you plan to run them (especially K), slow down, and explain your links and alternatives. I also am not as familiar with the philosophical literature that often comes up in LD kritiks and theory arguments; however, I keep a very open mind about debate. Do what you do best.

CPs
¨ Need to fulfill all requirements of a normal Aff plan (solve, have plan text, etc.)

Presentation/style
¨ Debate is not about destroying opponents – it is for education and openness.
¨ Dignity should be maintained for everyone involved. Avoid slurs.

Best way to win (do all three):
¨ Explain the best standards for winning (don’t make me decide for myself or let your opponents decide for you)
¨ Explain how you meet those standards (analytically and/or empirically)
¨ Explain how your opponents do not meet those standards and/or why their standards are wrong and/or why your opponents do not meet their own standards
