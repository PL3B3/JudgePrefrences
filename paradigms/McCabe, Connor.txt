  Experience: I debated for four years at Loyola High School, and I am currently debating for Wake Forest.

Things to know
1. Do what you do best - I'm willing to listen to anything. However, I've mostly read arguments on the policy side of things, so my knowledge of critical and performance arguments is limited. Going for a K will require a higher level of explanation for me to understand the arguments compared to other judges.
2. Haven't researched the topic - If there are any acronyms or terms in your speeches, I likely do not know them.
3. Clarity over speed - I'll say clear if that becomes an issue.
4. Besides conditionality, I think theory arguments are generally reasons to reject the argument not the team. I am generally not willing to drop a team on a blippy, unwarranted theory argument even if it was dropped unless the reason to reject the team is lengthily articulated throughout the entire debate.
5. If you're reading blocks off the computer, make sure you don't stick your head really close to the computer or blaze through pre-written analytics without any form of articulation.

Ask before the round if you have any specific questions.
