Philosophy:
I believe that speech and debate serves as a way to learn effective communication skills in addition to argumentation and research skills. If you are talking so fast that communication is lost then you have done the event a disservice. If I can’t hear it I can’t flow it. Just having more evidence doesn’t mean that you have won the round. Impact analysis is imperative to any case. 

I am okay with K's and counterplans.

All debaters should show courtesy to their opponents. There is a clear difference between being passionate and assertive in a round and being disrespectful. You will lose the round if you are rude and disrespectful. 

Please make sure that all you have evidence you use in the round. If your opponent asks for it please provide it promptly. I will only ask to see it if there is an issue raised. 

Finally, if you want to win make sure you outline voters and tell me why you have won the round.
