  Background:

I debated two years at Broken Arrow High School, was a policy debater in college, and am now coaching Putnam City North High School in Oklahoma City.

Speed:

Do not blaze at 100% in front of me. I can flow speed, and I like some speed, but ultimately you have to be very clear. I will yell clear once or twice, but I'm not going to evaluate arguments that I do not understand. You must slow down for taglines and author names.

Kritiks:

Don't run Kritiks in front of me; I don't like them, even in Policy Debate.

Theory:

I will evaluate RVIs, but my biggest problem with theory is that it is not ran properly. I do not particularly enjoy a theory debate, and your speaks will suffer if I feel you are running theory as a means out of having to debate the topic, and there really isn't clear abuse.

DAs/CPs/Plans:

Again, I'm not a huge fan of a lot of these arguments solely because they are usually not ran properly, so if you take the risk to do so, make sure you know what you're doing.

Weighing:

There HAS to be a standard to weigh the round, and I will not budge on that. I'm not going to evaluate floating arguments that do not link back to some standard, and it is your job to weigh the round and crystallize properly.

On another note, I am not an interventionist judge. I do not like to intervene, so I will not do so unless there is something incredibly, blatantly offensive within the round.
