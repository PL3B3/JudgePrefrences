  Background 

I debated LD for 3 years and graduated from Plano Sr. in 2009. I debated mostly on the local circuit around Dallas with a few appearances on the national circuit.

Weighing 

I am open to alternative weighing mechanisms as long as they are justified. Without a justification I will move to a standards based analysis. Everything needs to link. 

Speed 

I should be fine with most speed (keep in mind that I donâ€™t debate anymore). However, if you are unclear your flow will reflect it, and if it is not on my flow, I will not vote for it. Also I am not familiar with all the philosophies out there and you may want to slow it down to a degree.

Other

I expect competitors to have timers and to time themselves.

I will only give 30 speaker points to you if you are amazing, jokes are a plus.

Feel free to ask questions.
