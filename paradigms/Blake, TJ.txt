  Debate Experience: 4 years varsity policy debate (KS DCI Circuit)
Topic Experience: I have judged at two tournaments this season

Preferences:
Speed/Clarity- This is the Kansas boy in me but I think clarity always comes first and not just in your tag. If I can’t understand you, I’m probably not going to flow you. With that being said, if you are clear I should be able to listen to whatever pace your choose to go at.

Counterplans- I will listen to whatever you have here.

Topicality- I love a good T debate- especially if the aff is topical. You need an impact to every argument you make. This means that you can’t just say, “Reasonability creates judge intervention” or “Competing Interpretations creates a race to the bottom” and expect me to care.

Kritiks- Here is where I’m going to make some people mad. If you want to win my ballot, you shouldn’t paint circles or read your DI on the aff. I still think policy debate is a good thing and the policies should remain a part of it. Even if you are negative I think framework is a separate theory argument than framing (If you have questions ask). That being said, I will listen to any argument you read. You will definitely have to put a focus on explanation if you are not reading a common K.

Theory- Everything can be voting issue.

As a general rule, treat me like I don’t know what’s up. You aren’t going to offend me because you do too much explanation or calculus. Tell me where and why to vote. Also, don’t be a jerk. Like seriously. Your speaker points from me are probably going to be great don’t screw that up by being a jackwagon.
