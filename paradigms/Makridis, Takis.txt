  I debated four years in high school and one year in college - going to the TOC and making it to quarters and qualifying for the NDT in college. I remember, and always disliked, judge interventionism - so I resolve the debate based on the frameworks and implications that you make throughout the round.

I almost always went for topicality and critiques in high school, so if you are a very talented debater on either of those fronts, I will certainly appreciate a good debate. However, if it turns into a debate with constant buzz words with no contextualized link analysis and little emphasis on key points, you've probably got more to worry about than the ballot in this round.

During college I became very versatile at counterplan/politics and I enjoy them as well. Every argument needs to fit, so if you're just rambling I probably won't flow and it will also undermine your speaker points. If there is anything else you have questions on, feel free to ask.
