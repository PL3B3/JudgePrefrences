  Years debating: 5 [high school/college]

I debate for the University of Wyoming and debated for Green River High School previously.

I'm a little unfamiliar with the resolution, so if there are weird acronyms, please make me aware of them.

I'll listen to anything, so long as it makes sense. If your style is unorthodox, explain why it's superior and make sure it's responsive to your opponent. Run your arguments correctly. I love debate just as much as you do, so treat yourselves, your opponents, and your partners with respect.

I will do no work on the flow. If I get a voter out of the 1AC and no other voters/refutation of voters throughout the remainder of the debate, I will vote where I was told in the 1AC.

Keep it fun and good luck!
