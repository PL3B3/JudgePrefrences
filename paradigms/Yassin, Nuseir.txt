  I generally think it's easier to be fast than to flow speed. That being said, I can handle it and have no prejudice against you but signposting and internal structure is absolutely necessary. If you're going to speak quickly and have a disorganized case I'm going to penalize you. I also wasn't really fond of theory and think nearly every round can be won without it so you could kind of say I have a high threshold for what can be considered abusive. Use theory wisely, and justify it when you do so. Make sure you create a framework for the round that you link back to. I want clear warrants and a clear statement of your advocacy, particularly if you're running critical or unorthodox arguments.
