  I am a tabula rasa judge, I will vote on da/cp, the K or
theory...however, theory debates must be explained just as any other
argument in terms of its impacts and voting implications. A good 2A/N
will extend warrants, not tag lines, and evaluate the impacts in a
comparative fashion. While I have numerous years of debating and
coaching experience, it is not what I do full time now. I do go to a
few tourns a year, so I know what is basically going on, but I do not
follow the topic(s) like I used to. My current work is in Linguistics
and cognitive science at USC (PhD Candidate).
