  I am a senior at Creighton University. I have a little bit of experience with Public Forum, and I have judged some novice LD. In my mind, cases should link to a value and criterion structure. I do not understand speed or theory arguments. High speaker points go to debaters that are persuasive and look at the big picture at the end of their final speeches. I appreciate concise arguments, extending points and cards, and refuting all opponent claims. 

Feel free to ask clarification questions before the round.
