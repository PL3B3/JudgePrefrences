  I debated CX and LD in high school and CEDA and British Parliamentary in college in TX. That was a long time ago. Now I judge mainly LD, with some PF and Policy thrown in occasionally. I know my way around the block, but don’t assume I know everything.

Speed is OK, but I’ll tell you (verbally) if I’m not getting everything and I’ll be annoyed if you are spreading for no good reason.

Flashing is fine, but do it quickly.

Open CX is fine.

I generally don’t care where you speak from, how you are dressed, or how informally you speak as long as it’s a good debate.

Be nice, though. I don’t like debaters who disrespect others.

I mainly operate as a tabula rasa judge. I’m open to most arguments, but want a clear explanation as to why I should vote on it. I’m sure there are exceptions to this if you try to push ethical boundaries with an argument.

I like a clear debate with lots of clash and clear summaries that explain how you think I should weigh things and how I should vote. Don’t leave it up to me to weigh everything.

I don’t like to have to ask to see cards because I think debaters need to put the arguments on the flow and give me enough info to make a decision. I will ask to see something if it’s not clear in the end and it might be a voting issue, though.
