  My experience judging has been in the NOVICE DIVISION of Northeast tournaments.

I competed in high school LD, so run whatever policy arguments you want at whatever speed you want. That being said, if you run arguments that justify oppression in any way I will not hesitate to drop you with a 17.3. I also do NOT like frivolous theory or tricky cases, but if your opponent is being legitimately abusive then I’ll evaluate it. I’ll say clear as many times as it takes for me to understand you, so if I’ve stopped flowing it’s because I honestly have no idea what in heaven’s name you are trying to say. Lastly, debate is supposed to be a civil, educational activity, so please do not make it a negative space by being offensive or rude to your opponent in CX or any of the speeches.
