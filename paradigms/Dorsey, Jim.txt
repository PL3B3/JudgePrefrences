Principal judging assignment is Lincoln Douglas.

Overall Philosophy

Value, value criterion is my first preference. Affirmative burden is to uphold the resolution. I hate to intervene but sometimes the flow becomes muddled in a messy debate round. Theory debate is fine and I will listen to topicality, Kritiks and other voters. However, I see the round in terms of a fairness debate and spreading out your opponent to build up a utilitarian calculus where the debater wants me to vote of drops may be seriously disappointed. I always prefer depth over breath.

We don't get out of the state more than a few times a year, but the quality of Lincoln-Douglas here in the State of Washington is quite high.
