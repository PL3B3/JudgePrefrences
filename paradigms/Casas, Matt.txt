I'm not debating this (fall 2015) semester, but I've been debating for mostly the last six years. I've been in various kinds of debates. I'm not going to go through arguments I like or don't like on here because I think it's more important to say that I like memorable debaters, memorable debate rounds, and giving memorable decisions. I can listen to a variety of perspectives, not necessarily from an objective or neutral standpoint, but I find it to be both an opportunity and a privilige to be challenged to think critically. I think that cross x's are debate's most important speeches. I think a lot of people expect me to side critically in clash of civilization debates when the truth is that I spend a lot of time thinking about how traditional debate could function in these debates. It's rare that I have paper or pens for flowing.
