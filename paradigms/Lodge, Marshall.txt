I am a second year student at Berkeley, and while I haven't debated recently I did LD for one year and PARLI for three years in high school, so I sort of know my way around a flow. I don't have any particular preference when it comes to what kind of case you run, so long as you have both solid evidence and sound logic I will entertain whatever conclusions you wish to present. That being said, I do have one simple request:

DON'T SPREAD
 
Is that clear enough? It doesn't really matter to me how many points you make or contentions you have if I don't have enough time during your speech to write even a word or two about your arguments down on my flow. If it doesn't make it to my flow, I don't consider it for my decision. Period. It pains me to have to resort to a brute force method such as this, but my experience so far has taught be that speed is impossible to moderate once the round actually begins so I have to nip this in the bud, as it were. As a corollary, if your case is so massive that you absolutely must spread in order to get through it all, either write a more concise case or don't run that case for me.


Just to be clear: I harbor no ill will toward those who spread or those who have expansive arguments with mountains of evidence that makes getting through you constructive speech an nightmare if you speak slowly. It's simply much easier for me to reach a decision if I have notes to work off of and I can be sure those notes are complete and accurate. Otherwise, I can easily forget arguments, falsely attribute statements to either debater, etc. and I'd like my decision to be as fair as possible.

Side note: I only know the basics of LD Jargon, (Value, Value Criterion, etc.) so don't throw too much of that my way and expect it to do you any favors on your own.

Summary: 
 Case Theory: Go Wild
Spreading? No.
Speaker points: Based on Variance, Passion and absence of stutters and space-fillers.
