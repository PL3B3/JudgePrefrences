Run what you want but here's a few notes
-If your position isn't clear in the first constructive, I am going to be skeptical of new articulations in the next speech
- I don't want speech docs because I should be able to flow you off of your speech aka if you're too fast I won't flow you (as a person competes on the national circuit in college, use your best judgement on what too fast is) 
-Be careful on R.O.B. that ask me as a judge to use my own personal relationship to debate to break down "X" because I will do that but you never know how I will decide
- I think as judge and an adult it is my responsibility to make sure that students in the community feel safe or at least comfortable enough to communicate with an adult when they feel unsafe.
-Also (even though this is a no-brainer for everyone outside of the debate world), if I don't understand your argument by the end of the round I'm not voting for you. Your kritik can be completely right but what difference does it make if you didn't articulate it well.
-Feel fee to email me and ask any specific questions.
