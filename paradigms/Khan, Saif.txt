  I debated for all years four years of high school and had a lot of success in parli. I’m quite comfortable with plan/cp debate, but I have no background in LD and will need you to explain the topic and your philosophical position very clearly. I am a tabula rasa, flow judge that can follow moderate speed, but I’ll shout, “clear” if I can’t keep up with you. I will not extend dropped arguments for you, so make sure to tell me what to extend and why it matters in the round. Feel free to run whatever theory you want, but I would recommend that you don’t run K’s since my experience with them is limited.
