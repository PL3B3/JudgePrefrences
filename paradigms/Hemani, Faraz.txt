  Don't try to tailor your arguments to a certain style of debate you think appeal to me, I would much rather judge you while you are reading the arguments you are best at and most comfortable in presenting. I don't think I'm in a position to try to limit the scope of arguments that should be allowed in a given debate round, that choice belongs to the debaters.

I have no predisposition against any type of disad, counterplan or procedural. For critical arguments, I am unfamiliar with some of the literature but please do not let that dissuade you from reading one infront of me. All i ask is that more complicated discussions should avoid the buzzwords from a specific author's literature as much as possible and should be well explained. 

Don't lie, cheat, steal etc. If you have nothing left to say in your speech, I would really prefer you sat down instead of forcing another 2 minutes of underviews; keep everything short and sweet if you want speaker points! More important than any of my preferences, have fun. Debate belongs to the debaters and not the judges, do not try to adapt to me in a way that makes you less confident in your ability to execute a certain strategy or makes the debate less enjoyable and rewarding for you.
