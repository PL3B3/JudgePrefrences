Greetings,
I'm a lay judge that usually only frequents local circuits for the past 6 years, so please don't expect me to vote off of progressive cases including theory, k's etc. I am okay with speed, but clarity above all else. I like to hear unique arguments, but I find it key to have proper weighing in round. If you are running dense philosophy or some other critical argument, make sure you explain clearly and completely. Voting issues are preferable at end of final speech. The use of jargon and technical language ("turn", "extend", "cross-apply", etc.) are acceptable during rebuttals. Final rebuttals should include voting issues and line-by-line analysis. Quality of speech and presentation are things that I will also note, so at least try to deliver a compelling speech. Evidence and research (analytical and empirical) are key to having a good foundation for any argument, but arguing logic and clarifying them with definitive values supported by experts or the like is equally viable. Again, ensure that any complex or potentially confusing philosophy is explained early on. Yes, I keep a rigorous flow. If you have a question, please feel free to ask before the round.
Good luck in your rounds!
