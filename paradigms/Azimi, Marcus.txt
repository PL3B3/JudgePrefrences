How to get good Speaker Points
- Debate is a communication activity, your job is to persuade and convince not just to spew words for 90 minutes and expect me to stay attentive. 
- Always default to clarity over speed, especially during the beginning of any speech (I cannot stress this enough) I will yell "CLEAR" twice, After that do not expect me to flow your speech. If there is a fundamental barrier preventing me from flowing you and I am attempting to convey this issue and you still refuse to listen for whatever reason ..
- attempt to connect with me, you are trying to persuade me
-1NC should label the 1NC offcase positions while signposting (1st off is T *read T shell*, 2nd off is the K *read k shell*, etc.)
- The 2AR/2NR should be slower than any other speech, In a very good last speech i should be able to distinctly hear every word in the speech.
-Slow down on the (Counter) Plan text, T shells, Theory shells and alt text.
- I take into account how much time you put in an argument and how much analysis when making a decision, that being said, if you only spend 5 seconds extending an argument in the 2nr/2ar dont expect me to put much weight on it.

Topicality/Theory
- I think my threshold for T and Theory is somewhat high (might be because I lean more to reasonability) this doesn’t mean I won’t vote on it but you have to prove the abuse. 
- At the end of the debate I need a clear articulation of what the violation is.
- I think reject the argument not the team arguments are pretty strong on theory, if you make this argument for the counterplan there still should be offense against the case.
- Also have a really high threshold for Theory and tend to err neg on the following:
o Condo o Agent CPso Most PICS- I have a lower threshold and err aff for the following
o Process CPso Conditions CPso Some Consult CPs (if its not a uniquely key country/ group)- I put hardly any weigh on most specification arguments, unless there is a full concession there isn't a reason to extend it in front of me.

DA
- These are good
- Make DA turns case arguments
- Good impact calculus in the 2nd rebuttal.

K/ K Affs
- Explain the alternatives, how that interacts with the aff/ the rest of the K ( how it solves the impacts of the K)
- Framework needs in depth fairness and education claims. I need reasons why hearing/reading your kritik is good for the activity/ really important for us to learn about in this setting. (especially when reading a k aff.)
