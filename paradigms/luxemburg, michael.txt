  My name is lux. I debated 4 years at GDS. I debate at Bard now. I prefer kritikal arguments to policy arguments, but I am down with any and all arguments. I am pretty sure nothing is good or bad, but everything is dangerous. I can be persuaded of anything, and I really appreciate humor. If you can be funny and sound good you'll get good speaks. I'm reluctant to vote on cheap theory or nitpicky T arguments unless they are dropped or VERY well impacted, and even if they are dropped they still need to be impacted. Basically do what you want, and have fun. If you have other questions email me at Michael.luxemburg@gmail.com.
