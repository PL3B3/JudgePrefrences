  I am currently the head coach of a team that competes in all debate events. I also competed in both Lincoln-Douglas and Policy Debate.
My paradigm can be applied to both debates.

I will flow the round and can keep up with speed. However, effective communication is an important part of this activity. 
I generally describe myself as a tabula rasa judge. I am open to any arguments if they are covered well. The team that better discusses the paradigm and voting issues of the round will usually end up winning my ballot. The earlier you start discussing the framework and role of the ballot-the better.
