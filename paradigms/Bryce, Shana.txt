Ill try to make this as short as possible:
Let's say what not to do first:
Counter plans are counterproductive, it'd be in your best interest not to run this in front of me. I strongly advise against it because I don't like the theory debate that comes with it and I don't want to hear case vs. case (net benefit)

I'd also prefer if you didn't run framework because I've had enough experience in debate that I don't need to hear a whole tournament of how I should frame debates. FW shouldn't be your default but a last resort.

I'd rather just hear case, dis ads and kritiks 

Dropped arguments=conceded arguments
clarity over speed, if I don't hear it I won't flow it
depth over breadth = good

do what you want as long as you don't adhere to any bad isms
