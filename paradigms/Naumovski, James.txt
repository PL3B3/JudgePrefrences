  Conflicts – Carmel Valley KL, Mountain View, Los Altos

I debated for four years for Los Altos High School. CPS is my first time judging, so just keep that in mind. Start slowly, and then speed up – I'll say clear/slow as much as I need to.

I'm most well versed in analytic philosophy/theory, but feel free to read whatever you're comfortable with, whether it is K's/LARP. I'm familiar with most arguments that will be run, but be sure to err on the side of over-explanation, especially for uncommon arguments.

Speaks will be decided on how good the round was, in terms of both quality of the debate and how entertaining it was. I'll give you above a 28.5 if I think you can clear.
