A good debate about Topicality The ability for teams to properly clash over topicality, instead of dismissing the other team over it.
A good debate about Theory:


A good debate about disads: Stressing the disads will no doubt catch my attention, and specific disads always make a good debate and prove the neg is well prepared.
A good debate about counterplans:
Proving that, without a doubt, your plan is better than the original.
A good debate about Kritiks: Being able to argue something OTHER than kritiks alongside, kritiks can only enhance.
