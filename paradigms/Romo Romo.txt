  I debated for 4 years at South East High School, and I'm a third year at Cal. I've judged at BAUDL and LAMDL tournaments before as well as the Cal Invitational.
I will vote on any arguments that are explained thoroughly and convincingly; I don't have an opposition to any specific types of debate. You do you, just make sure that you explain yourself well.

I am okay with spreading, as long as it is clear.
