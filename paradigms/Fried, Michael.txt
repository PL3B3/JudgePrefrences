  I qualified to the TOC 3 times and broke twice. I debated for the University School in Florida
Conflicts: University School (FL), Cypress Bay, Bettendorf

I don't care what you do in the round, I'll adjudicate everything impartially because at the end of the day, it's the debaters' debate, not mine.
Here's what you get + speaks for:
-sacrificing speed for clarity
-explaining the overall strategy of arguments
-doing good argument interaction
-going for permissibility and skepticism and pre-value tricks/aprioris/anything well
-going for substance well
-going for theory well
-Slowing down at beginning of 2nr to explain global strat
-Slowing down at the beginning of 2ar to quickly explain why you win

Heres what you get - speaks for:
-speaking too quickly i can't understand you
-reading arguments i really really don't understand too quickly
-be late for round
-use of abbreviations when i have no clue what they stand for

In addition, my favorite snacks are tasty and probably would come from the chip section of vending machines. Favorite drinks are Mountain Dew and orange soda.

I'll make facial expressions during the round and probably be expressive as to what arguments I like, don't like, and whether or not you can just move on with an argument. This is a fair practice since I'll do it for both debaters.

Also, my understanding of theory has the thought of one debater reading a shell, then the other debater reads a counter interpretation with an RVI and then telling me why that means you vote for me

I like when debaters are more informal, but extremely relaxed and show their personality and humor in rounds. Cross-ex I think is a time when amazing and hilarious exchanges could take place, you get higher speaks for doing that.

I think you could tell what I thought made a good judge by some of my favorite judges: Alex Zheng, Matt Wilson, Catherine Tarsney, the Lius (sometimes), Ben Holguin, Renzi, Jeff Gans, Ari Parker (2 years ago), Wade Houston.

My speaks will be extremely reflective of how I thought both debaters performed in the round; this means if I thought both debaters were awesome, double 30's. But if I am not having a good time then people may be seeing some 26's.

Also, don't be afraid to ask any question before or after the round
