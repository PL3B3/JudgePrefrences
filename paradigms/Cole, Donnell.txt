Mervo/Baltimore Urban Debate League
I am a teacher and a first year debate coach.
I have judged debates on the transportation topic in Baltimore and at regional tournaments.
I like to see strong, clear, passionate clash.
You don’t want to use a lot of jargon or focus too much on debate theory, and you want to watch out with speed: keep an eye on me when I am flowing. If you are going too fast, I will offer a warning. If you ignore it, don’t expect me to catch what you say.
My teams tend to run fairly traditional arguments, but I am open to all different types of arguments, so long as you can explain them clearly.
Offer me clear criteria to evaluate the arguments in the debate, and debate well!
