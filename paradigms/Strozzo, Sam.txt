  Judging Philosophy:

I debated two years of varsity policy and two of varsity lincoln douglas, with a few tournaments of public forum, extemporaneous speaking, original oratory, and dramatic interpretation. In general, I enjoy debate for the DEBATE, not the technicalities [as are frequent in policy especially]. I highly value the competetor's presence and oration, which I believe will greatly help the person in the "real world." I thus consider myself a fairly traditional judge; while I have no problem with speed, squirrel arguments, and other techniques that go with debate, I much prefer the "art of arguing."

In a nutshell, I'm fine with everything, but I prefer debate for its oratory value over the game that debate has become.
