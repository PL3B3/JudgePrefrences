  I don't have specific predispositions about Topicality, Disads, Counterplans, etc but here are a few general pointers to go by:

PLEASE DO: 

-Construct valid arguments and warrant them. Be sure to outline the impact of your claims, warrants and overall argument. Pitch clear impact calculus.

-Flag as you proceed/Signpost: If possible, please signpost as explicitly as possible (ex. My first argument is, My second argument is, In conclusion, etc)

-Display generic courtesy towards your opponents. You are more than welcome to deconstruct and criticize your opponent’s points but please refrain from criticizing matters that are not directly subject to debate. You may be penalized. 

PLEASE DON’T: 

-Give up clarity for speed. I would greatly appreciate reasonable pen time to make note of your arguments and that would help you far more than squeezing in arguments I may not even be able to consider.

-Be repetitive. Please refrain from simply rephrasing and restating the same point. Please don't speak just for the sake of speaking. If need be, take a moment to organize your thoughts and articulate yourself in a better manner.

-Make incorrect/untrue claims about your opponents points. For instance, do not insist they have dropped your points. You may be penalized if there is a discrepancy between my flow and your claim.

-Bring up new points in rebuttals. New examples are welcomed but new points are not.
