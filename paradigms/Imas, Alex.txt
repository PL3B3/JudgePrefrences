  I debated for 3 years for Walt Whitman High School on the local and national circuit, graduating in 2006. I am currently a Columbia Law Student.

I judge pretty rarely, so I almost certainly won't be able to keep up with top speeds, so if you're going to talk quickly ease into it. That also means I probably won't be up-to-date on the latest jargon, so you should explain everything pretty thoroughly - don't assume I'll know what you're talking about. That said, a lot of the things that are around now seem to have been around when I debated, so I won't discount any approach on face unless I don't understand it.

The easiest way to get my ballot is to set up a clear decision-making calculus and link to that. On that note, I also like to see a lot of clash, so pre-standards arguments might win you the round, but they will cost you a lot of speaks.
