  BIO
This is my fourth year as an assistant coach at Millard North HS in Omaha, NE. Prior to that, I have no high school or college debate experience. I primarily coach and judge Public Forum and work with our LD debaters.

SPEED
I am not fond of overly fast speakers. I prefer a much more deliberative delivery. I just have a difficult time thinking of Lincoln and Douglas discussing the moral issues of the day in a fashion that leaves them both gasping for air. I will try to keep up, but will have to ignore anything I miss.

STANDARDS/STYLE
I prefer traditional value-criterion debating that stays focused on the resolution at hand. I do not look favorably on major technical arguments or argumentation that devolves into an analysis of the round rather than the topic. I want to hear reasons, values, and analysis, not drops, turns, and pulls. 

I tend not to be a strict flow judge and look at the weight of each argument. Numerous little arguments that are not well developed will mean less, even if unanswered, than a few major ones developed in depth.

I place an exceptionally high burden on theory based arguments. It must be relevant and unique to the topic at hand. Stock theory arguments about why the event is unfair to a given side hold no weight for me.
