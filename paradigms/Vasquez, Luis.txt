  I debated for Canyon Springs HS. I will be graduating with a sociology major this Spring from UNLV.
 
Policy
Overview: My basic approach to policy judging is that the aff must convince me that their plan answers the resolution and improves the status quo. At the end of the debate I will ask three ask questions:
1) is the plan topical
2) after considering the advantages and disadvantage evidence, does the plan improve the status quo,
3) is there a unique and superior neg counter-plan or kritik.
If the Aff passes these three standards they win. If the plan does not, the Neg wins
I vote on the worth of the plan, counter-plan, kritik regardless of my opinion of who were the better debaters; however, I assign speaking points on debating performance.
