  I have a basic policy orientation -- I look for standards, good form and flow, good evidence and links, offensive minded debate from both sides, impact weighing from both sides. I am open to all arguments -- which can lead to some serious fun, sometimes -- but I also expect that you'll know when to kick something that isn't working.
