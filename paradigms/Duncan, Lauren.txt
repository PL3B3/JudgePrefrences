My default position is as a policy-maker- I tend to appreciate arguments on disadvantages and counter-plans, and not so much on kritiks or topicality arguments.Although, I am warming up to kritiks.
Kritiks- it needs to be clear and explained well. I need to know that you actually know what you are talking about. 
Topicality- “Soapbox Time” I have a very low tolerance for listening to T arguments, it doesn’t mean that I don’t vote it, it just means that I REALLY want to hear about "in-round abuse" to make it more legitimate. Potential abuse just doesn’t have much weight. Essentially if you are going to go for T, there needs to be a legitimate reason and not just as a time suck. 
Cross-Ex- is important!! I typically allow open cross-ex, but that doesn’t mean that one person should be running the show. Show me you really understand the issues by your questions and your answers and your points will go up. Also if you are a jerk to the opponents it can hurt your speaker points so remember to act appropriately. 
Presentation: “If I can’t Flow you, I don’t know you”. I feel it is my job to flow the round and make a decision based on the arguments presented and the information provided to me by the end of the round. But if I can’t understand you or you are just running as many arguments for spreading sake, then I will probably miss stuff. I do my best to keep up, but your presentational skills have as much to do with that. Clarity and organization will take you a long way and will make my understanding of your positions that much better. 

Please feel free to ask specific questions before the round.
