  Judging Philosophy-

- I tend not to vote on theory arguments unless there is significant work and reason for it.

I like to see in depth comparison and evaluation of the arguments, if you want to win I want to know

why the other team deserves to loose. Usually I'm fine with spreading, I'll tell you if I can't understand you,

just make sure your tags are slower.

- I'm comfortable with kritikal and identity debates just make sure your arguments are clearly articulated.

- I will not tolerate or vote for a team that engages in oppressive behaviors (no ableism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, sexism)
