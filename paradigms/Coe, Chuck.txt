I prefer traditional LD style using value and criterion, but other frameworks will be considered if the structure is clear. Cards must be clearly impacted.

Theory and K's OK.

I will listen to what you say; make sure you tell me how you think I should vote, and why, but don't claim that you've won issues that you haven't. Explain clearly why you have won certain issues, and why those issues should determine the vote.
