  I graduated from Plano Senior High School in Plano, Texas in the class of 2010. I coached at Evanston Township High School from 2011-2014. I now coach a middle school debate club in Southlake. I have been judging since I graduated including at many national tournaments and at TFA State. I will vote off of any type of argument as long as you tell me how it functions and how it gives you access to the ballot. I give speaker points based on technical proficiency NOT presentation. Please don't ask if I am "ok with speed", I will say clear if I can't understand you for any reason, go whatever speed you need. Theory debates are rarely clean, and if you choose to engage in a theory debate with me in the back of the room be aware that you have to make your arguments incredibly clear. While I will evaluate every argument as it is presented I do prefer "drop the argument" not the debater and a voter of education as opposed to fairness but those are just preferences. Unless it is absolutely necessary I would recommend investing your time in another strategy.


tldr; Run any cases, positions, strats, etc.
