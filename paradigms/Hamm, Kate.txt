Kate Hamm’s Judging Paradigm: I love good debate. I have been judging almost every form of competitive high school debate for almost 30 years. That being said, I do not have a pre-set vision for what ‘should’ happen in the debate. I will listen to your arguments and use whatever framework you provide. 
Types of Arguments: I tend to prefer debates on the resolution and I generally enjoy a substantive round about the topic (topical arguments usually come out of topic literature). That being said, I also think that critical arguments add an educational component especially when done within the confines of the resolution. 
K’s are arguments. They need to be argued and not ignored; however, they do need tangible alternatives, not merely “reject the mindset.” There needs to be substance and room for debate by both debaters.
Policy Arguments: While I am not a fan of generic disads, there are resolutions that lend themselves to policy arguments. I won't vote for extinction based on a "risk of offense" if your opponent has made sound, defensive answers that demonstrate the impacts won't happen or are highly improbable. 
Theory: I’m not a huge fan. I will vote on it only if I am convinced that there is no balance to the debate without it. 
Flex Prep: Nope. You have 3 minutes to ask questions. Use them to your strategic advantage. (If during prep you have a minor question, that’s fine)
SPEAKER POINTS:  Normally between 27-29
Clear speaking. If you spread be sure you are clear (articulate and enunciate)! I hate spread but I can flow it if clear (You will not get above a 28.5 if you spread)
Crystallization and impact weighing (28s and 29s)
Organization and sign-posting (A must! Without it, you may hang below 27)
Thoughtful and interesting arguments that don’t avoid debate 
Respect for all those involved (without respectful round, you could fall below 27)



 Feel free to ask me specifics before and after the round!
