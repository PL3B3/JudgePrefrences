Judging Philosophy:
For the most part, this is up for you to determine. I try to enter the round as tabula rasa as possible, but there are a few things you can do to improve your odds:

1. Clash, warrant, and weigh. Being explicitly organized is especially helpful for me to flow.

2. Have a story. If your strategy initially involves conditional and/or contradictory positions, it's helpful for me to know if this is intentional. Otherwise, make your arguments narratively coherent.

3. Tell me what to vote on and why. During your rebuttals, write the RFD for me. Be explicit: what do you have to do to win, and how have you achieved that? What did your opponents fail to do that should cost them the round?

4. As far as speed, you need to know your own limits. For me it's not an issue of speed but one of clarity; I don't care how fast you go as long as you're still actually saying words. The only time I've had trouble keeping up is when people speed through analytical blocks that pack 10 distinct arguments in a span of 15 seconds.

I'm fine with just about anything to the extent that it's more clearly and persuasively explained than by your opponent. Feel free to ask me if you have any specific questions. And have fun!
