Experience
I debated for 4 years at University High School in Irvine, California and now debate at the University of Washington. I’m primarily a 2A/1N but was double 2s my senior year of high school. As a 2A, I’ve mostly read soft left and identity affs. As a 2N, I preferred going for kritiks, topicality, and case turns. 

General
Debate is probably an educational space and a game – you probably have to defend that words mean somethingI default to the idea that the role of the ballot is to signify who did the best debating Impact calculus and evidence comparison needs to happenCX is importantBad K debates are worse than bad disad debatesTheory is most convincing when there’s in-round abuseAnything racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. will result in docked speaks
Affirmatives
Affs should affirm a topical actionAffs should have internal links, not just a chain of random impactsIf the aff does not defend a topical action, they should be able to defend why the aff is good for debate
Topicality/framework
I default to competing interpretationsT debates need to be impacted outFairness is less persuasive than education, limits, and state engagement/reform argsTopical versions of the aff that actually solve for the aff are pretty persuasive - so are case lists of untopical affs and of ground the neg loses
Kritiks
You should have specific links – at the very least, you should be able to contextualize your links to the affBe able to explain what the alternative is/does Probably not the best high theory judge
