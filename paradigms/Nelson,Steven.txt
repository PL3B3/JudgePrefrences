  I have been judging Lincoln-Douglas debate for a year. I have limited experience judging upper-echelon LD debate.

I always flow the debate. I will do my best to follow, but at about 250 words per minute is my maximum. Clear speaking is essential. Clarity of logic is often enhanced by numbering or lettering the main points (but please no subparagraphs). I have a relatively traditional paradigm and will not vote strongly on theoretical argumentation (unless it can be explained with a minimum amount of jargon and the abuse is clear), pre-standards voting issues, or critiques. Please keep jargon to a minimum â€“ discussing PICs (plan-inclusive counter plans) will likely not result in a win. My high school and life
experiences in debate have been parliamentary and school-board, city-council elections.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, clarity, tone, and courtesy. Interesting and well-thought-out logical positions will also be rewarded, but offensive arguments will be punished. I rarely miss noticing a dropped argument.

Finally, I always write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
