  I have judged and coached PF debate for 3 years.

During my time in debate I have only done PF and so have limited experience in other events. I know the ins and outs of PF debate and know what is expected to win rounds in front of both lay judges and flow judges. I also know and understand jargon words in debate as I use them on a regular basis in PF.

However, I do not have much experience with other events and have not judged them frequently. This means that I do not understand the specific functions of certain arguments in non-PF contexts. That does not mean that I reject those arguments, only that I might not understand them. I am philosophically ok with speed, theory and kritiks but I do not understand them, so please explain as much as possible to me if you run those arguments (and I would not be particularly fast).

If you have any questions before the round please do not be afraid to ask.
