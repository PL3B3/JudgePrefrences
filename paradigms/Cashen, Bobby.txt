  I debated policy, and ld in high school and have since become a member of the LMU debate team speaking in a British Parliamentary format. For the past 3 years, I have been coaching students in both Parliamentary and Public Forum formats. While I could judge in any format, I haven't judged anything but Parliamentary or Public Forum in a year.
In terms of a judging paradigm I feel as though I am fair and reasonable. I look for developed argumentation linking claims with impacts. While I believe that evidence plays a large role in Public Forum, unless the credibility of the evidence is incredibly suspect, I tend not to weigh certain evidence over others. I am a stickler for impacts and if none are present in the arguments I tend to take that into heavy consideration when adjudicating. I believe that presentation is very important to the debate, but will not deduct too many points unless the speech is difficult to understand or presented in a very disorganized manner.
