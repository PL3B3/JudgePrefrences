  I debated 4 years for Scarsdale High School and qualled to the TOC my senior year. I am currently a freshman at Harvard.

I think the round belongs to the debaters, not the judge, and so I will try my best to evaluate whatever kind of round you want to have. So long as I can understand you, I will be equally happy voting on Wilderson, condo logic, and everything in between.

I think speaks should correlate to how well you can execute your strategy. I’ll try to average a 28 but will reevaluate based on the individual tournament.

Misc:

Please slow down on tags/interps/important texts/etc. Really, slow down. I haven’t flowed since TOC last year. If you want me to catch a particular wording, the way to ensure that happens is to say it slower. I’ll also say slow/clear as needed. I won’t dock speaks if I’m saying slow/clear but you should probably make sure I caught your argument.

You can extend dropped arguments by just repeating the tag/impact. I think the argument has to be mentioned in every speech though, meaning if it wasn’t extended into the 1AR, I won’t evaluate it in the 2AR.

I’ll be most comfortable judging Ks/framework/skep/tricks. Theory/super LARPy debate somewhat less so.

Please make fun of Rahul Gosain, Tomer Cherki, and Michael Bogaty.
