  Zhou, Lin "David" (updated 01/17/2013): Judged novice and varsity LD in MA and at a few regional high school invitationals for the past 16 months.

I am a typical parent judge from ABRHS. I prefer conversational speed. A clearly laid out value/value criteria with a few well explained and argued contentions will be preferred to many many talking points.
