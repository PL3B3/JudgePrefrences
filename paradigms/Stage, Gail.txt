I am a parent judge. I am a practicing attorney. I think debate is a wonderful activity and prefer debaters to speak slowly and in an organized fashion. Please explain to me why your arguments show that the value is being attained through the criterion. I will take notes during the round; however, they will not be a rigorous flow like national circuit judges. I am not familiar with theory and would prefer you to just debate substantively about the topic as a whole.
