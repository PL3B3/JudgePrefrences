  I debated LD at Glenbrook North from 2002-4. I am now a medical student.

I am laidback, so feel free to loosen/remove your neckties or give speeches while seated if it helps your argumentation. Be funny, it helps me pay attention.

Please explicitly provide me with one mechanism to determine the round's winner. Establish the (un)importance of individual arguments within this decision calculus.
