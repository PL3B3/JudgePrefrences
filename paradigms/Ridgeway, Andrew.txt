I prefer to listen to a handful of well developed arguments than to dozens of poorly explained arguments.I'd rather listen to a debater who is smart than listen to a debater who is fast."Extinction" is not a tag.Just because you can say something doesn't mean you should.If you can't explain your kritik to your parents, you haven't researched it enough and you probably shouldn't run it in front of me.I don't understand your acronyms.Some things just aren't funny. Know where to draw the line.Don't interrupt your partner.If you know you'll never go for a particular argument in the 2NR, don't include it in the 1NC.Don't be rude or condescending towards your opponents.Cross-examination is a speech. It should proceed according to a strategy.Don't impact turn things that are obviously terrible.Don't forget to ask me about the SCuFI.
