I debated for 4 years at Eagan High School.

I can handle most speeds. I will say clear three times before I just stop flowing.

I would prefer you not run theory as I feel it limits the debate but I will vote on it just expect a low point win if I do.

There are no arguments I won't vote on.

Mostly be kind to your opponent and the debate round will go smoothly.
