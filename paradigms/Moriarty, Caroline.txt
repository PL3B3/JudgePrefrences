  Random--
-freshman at the University of Missouri - Kansas City
-I debated for three years at Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, SD, and I qualified to NSDA Nationals in Policy and Congress
-I'm always looking to learn new things
-Don’t be a jerk in round-- I have low tolerance for rude behavior, especially when the other team looks uncomfortable
-I’ll call for cards/want to be on email chain
-I have experience with stock issues and k debate and respect both styles
-debate your best-- I don’t want to prevent anyone from doing what they want to do
CPs--
I didn’t run a lot of CPs in high school, so I'm less familiar with the mechanisms, but they're great when well-explained.
T--
I think the general problem with T debates for me is that they get bogged down in standards v standards and other minutia-- if the T debate is fleshed out to where clash can determine the winner and loser, then I'm cool with it
If you’re going for T, GO FOR IT-- 5 minutes in the 2nr, the abuse should be there and nothing else in the round should matter
K--
I ran Ks on aff and neg, mostly fem and psychoanalysis, and I think K debate is interesting
One caveat, I’m not familiar with lots of Ks, meaning you’ll have to explain the story and how it interacts with the affirmative/resolution
Framework--
I feel like the approach to framework should be less “fairness/limits” in their conventional sense and more “let’s make policy in policy debate.”
I probably default to a “how do I make the debate space better” mindset
DA--
Sell me on the link story-- I have a tendency to think link cards are pretty bad (see evidence quality standard at the top)
Case--
Extensions of warrants are really important-- I definitely do not understand all plan mechanisms after the 1AC
Theory--
In round impacts are important, sell me on why it’s important to vote on them
Slow down and flesh out the argument
Any other things-- just ask, I will answer all questions to the best of my knowledge :)
