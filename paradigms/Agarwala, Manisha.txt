I am a parent of a student that has done LD competitively for three years. I have been to judge training, and I have judged more than twelve rounds of tournament debate. I am not oppsed to any kind of argumentation, but the cases and the arguments must be presented slowly enough for me to flow them and process the meaning of them. I am more likely to vote on philosophical arguments than on theory arguments.
