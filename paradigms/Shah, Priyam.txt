  I debated policy debate four years at Sunset High School in Portland, Oregon. I am fine with any argument - in my debate career I used a lot of different arguments: DA/CP's, K's, and (even) performance. I am fine with all of these arguments. 

Be clear. I also want you tell me why you won. 

Do not be mean to your opponents, if you are speaker points will get docked. 

If you have any questions let me know before the round.
