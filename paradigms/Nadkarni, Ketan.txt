  I graduated from Libertyville High School in 2006, where I debated for two years.

My judging paradigm: I enjoy being the moderator for a debate that is well-organized, well-researched, and one that is as professional as possible. I like to see debaters use concrete examples to support their contentions and uphold their values. I do not like to see cross-examinations that get overly emotional or personal. In other words, if an individual becomes angry or mean in their examination of his or her opponent, I believe this individual should lose speaker points due to lack of professionalism. 

As much I like to see several supporting contentions and examples, I would much rather prefer a slower paced and organized case over one that is rushed, robotic, and incomprehensible. I like to emphasize to debaters that quality should trump quantity, and that by speaking slower and clearer, each point will have greater meaning. Also, positive body language is important in winning a debate. Speaking confidently and making eye contact with both the judge and the opponent can only strengthen one's presentation.
