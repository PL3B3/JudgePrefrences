  I debated for Walt Whitman High School for four years, and qualified twice to the TOC. I taught at NSD last summer. 

My only involvement with debate for the past year has been with the outreach program Penn for Youth Debate. Please keep in mind that I'm unfamiliar with the topic and not the best at flowing. If you have specific questions about my views on theory, please ask me. I won't vote on things I don't understand. I know nothing about critical philosophy, and I am only vaguely familiar with the newest trends, like metaethics. If you do decide to run something complex, don't read at top speed. Please show respect to all parties in the room if you want good speaks.
