  I'm debated for Dougherty Valley High School in Public Forum for four years. I'm now a freshman at the University of Chicago. 

My general preferences for a round are not super restrictive-I'm open to anything as long as you give me clear voters at the end of the round. I have a working knowledge of kritiks and theory, but really prefer the debaters to tell me exactly what I'm voting for/why, and how each argument functions within the round.

Don't drop role of the ballot. Don't drop important arguments in general.

Impact calc is huge for me, but I won't vote on badly warranted extinction scenarios just because they impact the greatest-make sure your impacts have multiple warrants and that you can win on at least one of them to access your impacts.

I evaluate framework pretty heavily, as long as its a decent debate and generates some sort of impact analysis I can weigh at the end of the round. I don't like skep. 

Don't make insensitive arguments or be insensitive. Don't come up with weird link stories on the spot. 

I'm okay with speed but slow down on taglines/actually enunciate if I say "clear." Don't spread super quietly either because that really annoys me and my hearing is bad.

T is fine with me, again there just has to be clear argumentation as to why I would vote on topicality and kick the case debate. Same idea for K debate-I'm a big fan of feminism/ableism kritiks.

Don't be condescending/asshole-y in round or I will destroy your speaks.
