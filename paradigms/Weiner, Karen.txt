I am a parent judge. I have limited experience as a judge but I am familiar with the Lincoln Douglas debate style and I enjoy judging.

During a debate round, I am looking for clear, easily understood speech in both speed and volume that permits me to follow your arguments. I like to hear debaters presenting and defending their positions while also fully addressing their opponents contentions.

I come to each debate round with an open mind, placing my personal opinions aside. I will award the win to the debater who in my opinion has stated the stronger case. Where the two sides have stated equally strong arguments and rebutted their opponents contentions with equal skill, I will award the win to the debater who in my opinion demonstrates the better speaking style.
