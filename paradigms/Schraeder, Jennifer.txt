  I am currently the Speech & Debate coach at Archbishop McCarthy. 
I was a policy debater in high school and college, so my primary concern is argument quality and comparison, not presentation. I will vote however the debate tells me to. I believe it is your duty to tell me what to vote on and how to prioritize impacts. Failure to do so, results in me deferring to personal preferences, which may or may not work in your favor. Save yourself the game of roulette, and tell me how you want me to analyze/prioritize/weigh the debate.
Due to coaching multiple events, I am not always up to date on all the latest arguments. Please do not assume I will understand hyper specific jargon. Explain your arguments. 
If you have any specific questions/concerns, feel free to email me jschraeder@mccarthyhigh.org or just ask me before the round.
