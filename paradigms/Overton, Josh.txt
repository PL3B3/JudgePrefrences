  I am currently a senior at Baylor University pursuing a double major in Speech Communication and Film & Digital Media. 

A brief overview of my debate background... 
2004-2008 - LD Debater Northland Christian School (Houston, TX) 
2008-2010 - LD Assistant Coach Northland Christian School (Houston, TX) 
2011-Present- LD Assistant Coach Cypress Falls High School (Houston, TX)


My style has always been about the substance of the argumentation on the topic. I am not a huge fan of flow tactics, although I do accept arguments like drop=true and a priori burdens. 

I can keep up with any speed, but again I would caution using speed because most of the time it sacrifices substance and explanation in favor of overloading/shallow flow games. 

I would be wary of running theory or heavily philosophical positions, not because I dislike them, but because I find that most debaters fail to explain/warrant/extend them sufficiently. If you don't explain/extend a cohesive story, I won't do it for you because I believe (as a communications student) that the best skill debate teaches in terms of preparation for college and professional life is the ability to communicate/persuade/defend. If you want me to extend an argument, you need to tell me why that matters and I will give it the weight you tell me to.
