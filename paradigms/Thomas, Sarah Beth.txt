Below, I have tried to shed light on what I enjoy during rounds. Of course this is brief, so if you have any specific questions, just ask.

First and Formost - things that help you read me.
I'm extremely expressive. I'm also on your side. I will be interested in the things you have to say, and how you say them. If I think you
are going to drop an entire flow, I'll start calling time at 90secs. 
I will hold flows and look at you if you forget something major. Look - I want you to debate and not make careless errors. I like a good debate
just like everyone else 
Stay clean. I'm a little OCD, and nothing makes me more angry or frustrated than a messy flow/round. 

I am a point fairy. =)

T
I love T. I love T theory. I love theory debates. I do not enjoy he said she said debates. If you are going to utilize theory args, please think it through. 
I like depth for theory. What does it mean to be predictable? Is it literature based or is it analytically based (just for an fyi - I think it's literature based)? 
Reasonability is a poor standard. I dislike it. I default to competing interpretations. 

CPs. 
Like. Dislike more than 1 conditional cp. 

Disads. 
Like. Esp Politics (Hello, I debated for Emory.)

Case. 
Usually good to have one, but I'm not picky.
Case debates - like. 

Ks.
Okay. I need a framework to work with (again, I went to Emory). 
You are going to need to explain in the 2nc what's going on - link story, impact, alt. I hate reject alts. They don't make sense. I like biopower. I like Foucault.
I also really really like framework.
