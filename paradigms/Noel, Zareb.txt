  I'm from a place where the ballots say "The team that did the better debating was..."
That is how I judge debates. I've been screwed over way to many times with judges that vote based on how they feel rather than the content of the round itself. Therefore, I am a pretty flow-heavy judge. If you take control of the flow then you have a pretty good chance of winning. However, that is only a general framing for how I judge debates.
First and foremost, my debate career has consisted of all types of debate within policy debate: Policy, Kritik, Performance, Hybrid, etc. Don't be afraid to run a politics disad in front of me. Likewise, don't be afraid to run a kritik or critical aff in front of me. Even though you may have heard a lot of crazy things that Tech CN did in the 1 year that we debated, that does not reflect how I judge people.
HOWEVER.
There are some caveats to my "anything goes" style of judging. 
I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY IN-ROUND PERSONAL ABUSE. What I mean to say is that there is a fine line between being a smart-ass and a jack-ass. Learn the difference
Other than that, the only other thing I want to see from people is how much fun they have because debate is fun, no?
