  Naemah Morris –Judging Philosophy
Coach: Immaculate Heart High School
I competed in LD (a long time ago) and have now coached for 10 years. First and foremost I want to see CLASH. I also need you to remember that I’m in the room and at the end of the round I need to make a decision. Please speak to me, not to your computer screen, the podium or your flow.
If you want me to vote your way, tell me why I should. If you want me to extend an argument tell me what the impact of the argument is. If you want me to care when your opponent drops arguments, make sure you don’t drop them as well. Don’t dump arguments on your opponent and don’t assume that reading 5 cards from the same guy means you have convinced me. All you’ve done is told me what this person thinks, not necessarily why I should care.
Some may say I’m a little old fashion in the sense that I prefer quality over quantity. I want you to make clear arguments that you can support with evidence and LOGIC. Just because you have a card telling me we will all die in eight days doesn’t mean I will buy it. However I won’t intervene. If your opponent fails, for whatever reason, to refute your claims and you can tell me why that matters, you will win the round. If your opponent does refute your arguments, don't tell me they didn't, I am flowing, even if you aren't. 
In my book LD is still a value debate, but ultimately I will judge the round in whatever way you convince me it should be judged. Just remember that your primary goal should be proving your opponent’s arguments are flawed otherwise I could just read your cases and we could all be finished in 10 minutes.
