  Disclaimer: These are my personal beliefs in debate, but tbh I will vote for anything if it is explained.

Background: In high school I debated from 10th-12th grade for Crenshaw High, a school in south central Los Angeles. During this time I was strictly policy. I didn't even know that performance debate or any other types of debate existed. Oddly, I now debate for Fresno State, a performance team. 

Traditional affs: Make your impacts seem as real world as possible. The traditional debate world does a wonderful job of making large scale impact claims that have a very low probability. For me, probability outweighs magnitude so do a good job of explaining the likeliness of your impacts happening rather than it's enormity.

Performance affs: I'm all for performance teams, just please tie your advocacy to the resolution in some way.

CP's: I used to run PICS in high school, but now I hate them. I'm fine with all other counter plans.

DA's: I won't vote on a disadvantage that has too long of an internal link chain.

K's: I need to understand the link just as much as the world of the alternative 

T/FW: I'm all for it. Sometimes that's the only way out when you're going against a performance team.

*spreading is fine too, just be clear
