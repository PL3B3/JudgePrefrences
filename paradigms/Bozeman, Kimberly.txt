  Background:

I did not debate in high school and started competing at the college level. I am extremely passionate about debate. I like nice clear plans with well-structured advantages and disadvantages. I like real world examples; I am not just going to fall for the nuclear war scenario unless you can clearly articulate how we get there.

Summary

I love Kâ€™s however they need to link and have a good warranted analysis. The K should be topical and uphold the resolution.I think Counterplans are very smart as long as you can show me that the CP is more beneficial than the plan.I will vote on TI will not do any work for you.I will deduct speaker points for any type of rudeness.
If you have any questions please feel free to ask before the round starts. I am here to provide feedback and give you quality judging.
