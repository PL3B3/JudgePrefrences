  I've been judging speech and debate for over 25 years. I do expect the debaters to be good, persuasive communicators. Sufficient evidence is needed on both sides to support the arguments. Don't limit yourself to stating you don't agree with opponents stance, give specific reasons why and provide supporting evidence. Make sure that during the delivery, you speak clearly in order for me to hear all of your points and watch rate of delivery. I can't vote on what I don't hear or can't understand. Must clash!!!!! I do not intervene, so the debaters must tell me what is important and why I should vote for them.
