Harvard '21

I did LD for 3 years at Cambridge Rindge and Latin (MA), almost exclusively on the national circuit.

 Short Version: 

I try to intervene as little as possibleI’ll listen to anything that isn’t screwed up so you should do what you’re good atSpeed is fine but I can't really flow anymore, take that how you like

Misc Important Things
I really like disclosurePlease try to provide a copy of your case to your opponent (flash, pass pages, email chain, etc.)You must use prep to compile speech docs, but not for emailing/flashingI won’t call for cards unless 1) there’s a genuine dispute over what the card says or 2) I missed something and it’s my fault. It’s your job to explain your arguments to me. Don’t just say “call this card—I promise it’s fantastic!”I won’t vote on arguments if I don’t understand their function or warrant (or if they don't have a warrant)I presume neg unless told otherwiseIf you say "game over" in your speech, it's "game over" for your speaks
T/Theory
Frivolous theory doesn't really bother me, unless it's run against novicesI default to: no RVIs, competing interps, drop the debater on T and drop the argument on theory
CP/DA
I default that perms are a test of competition
Ks
Buzzwords aren't warrantsI think that the "role of the ballot" debate isn't as important as people think it is--it's usually implicated by the impact debateRe: T against K affs—I've voted both ways, but I err towards thinking affs should be topical, or at least should have something to do with the topicI tend to be skeptical of claims about "prefiat" offense coming from simply reading a position
FW
Often a mess but great when it's not
Tricks
Being excessively sketchy in CX is sort of annoying -- at least be straightforward about your trickinessI'll evaluate them but (a) I don't fully understand some of them because I never read them and (b) I miss a lot of tricks because I'm not great at flowing --- and if I don't get the warrant for the argument in the first speech, I won't evaluate itI find Ks of skep persuasive, so read it at your own risk
