I debated for Apple Valley for 4 years and graduated in 2004. I consider myself a reasonably tolerant judge, but a little curmudgeony. I encourage any debater to ask questions before the round. A few specifics:

I will evaluate the round however the debaters want me to. One major caveat is that I don't find reject alts and their ilk persuasive at all. Generally speaking, if you don't suggest an actual alternative to the K, I don't know why I should be voting for you. More generally, I like debates that are a competing worlds proposition. 

Speed isn't typically a factor, but be coherent. I'm not current on even the most frequently used literature in the activity, so use caution when you read dense material. 

A few thoughts on theory. It's fine, but please enunciate the interp. If I miss that, you're just wasting time. Be very clear how different mechanisms function, and be clearer in weighing all facets of the theory debate. This actually applies to all areas of the flow.

Generally, I believe it is the debater's burden to make clear arguments and extensions. I won't weigh for you, or fill in the blanks when I miss your argument. 

Ask questions. Be respectful. Have fun.
