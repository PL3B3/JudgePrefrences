  There is nothing I hate more than bad theory debates. If you go for theory you must impact your arguments thoroughly and make comparative analysis because I will not do the work for you. I must warn you that on CP theory I have a negative bias, so if you are affirmative and want me to vote on theory then I recommend you go all in on it in the 1AR and 2AR. If you go for topicality, I would prefer you go for the entirety of your last negative speech unless it is conceded. 

You can run anything you want in front of me. If you run the K you need to clearly articulate what the world of the alternative would look like comparative to the world post the plan. While I do not mind judging the K, I do not like rejection alternatives. Politics DAs are awesome, especially ones that have hegemony impacts. I am inclined to believe that hegemony solves everything. 

Please do impact analysis in the last two speeches because it makes my life a whole lot easier. If you have any specific questions just ask me.
