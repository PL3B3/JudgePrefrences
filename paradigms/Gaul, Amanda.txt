  I have experience only in PF. I look for a balance of logic and evidence. While I appreciate frameworks and weighing mechanisms, I want teams to focus on debating the resolution first and foremost. I also prefer straightforward arguments that capture the spirit of the resolution instead of arguing over nuances in interpretation. Civility is a must.
