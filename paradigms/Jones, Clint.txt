  I prefer to judge traditional cases. Treat me as you would a lay judge. If you speak so quickly that I am unable to understand you, I will have a difficult time voting for you. Also, keep to the times of the debate, I am not going to be impressed if you go over your time in a misguided attempt to make things more difficult for your opponent.
