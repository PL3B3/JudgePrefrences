  This is my 3rd year coaching. In LD rounds I look for imperics over theoretical arguments. I can understand theory, however, I will genrally look more towards the framework and contention level arguments when evaulating who won the round. Not a big fan of Kritiques. I don't generally find them to be useful to winning the round. I highly value the potential 'real-world' impacts of the resoultion position.

Speed isn't an issue. If it is I will yell clear. I do allow flex prep in the round.
