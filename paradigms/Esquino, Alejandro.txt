  I am a first year out attending the University of Houston. I debated LD for Strake Jesuit for 4 years and have debated both nationally and locally. If you have any questions before the round feel free to ask me. There are two things I would like to note: I am not well read at all when it comes to more dense philosophy so, if you are going to run it then make sure to explain it as well as possible in all your speeches and realize that even then you run the risk that I will not understand and you will lose. Second, I was never really a big fan of theory because I felt that it was run a lot when it was just not necessary. So, here is how theory is going to work for me: you decide if it is reasonabiity or competing interpretations. However, consider this, if i feel that you are running theory to take advantage of a less experienced opponent or just as a time suck with no legitimate claim to abuse it will not affect whether or not I vote for you but it will affect your speaker points. That's all folks!
