  Getting good speaker points and winning the round-
I want to be seeing the debate from a realistic analytical viewpoint, too much statistics and your debate gets lost in the numbers. Give me a reason to believe that your plan and solution are the real reason why you win the debate, I don't want to see a bunch of wiki arguments flying my way. That said, don't be afraid to include them in your analytical argument. Prove that viewed from any perspective, your plan is superior in every way.
  
 Clarity-
 Incredibly important, spread as long as your making a point, don't get jumbled in your own speech. Passion, reasonability, and argumentative reasoning are the best reasons for a debater to showcase his or her strongpoints.
  
 Realism-
 Find a way that your topic and argument makes sense to people living here on earth. Regardless of how much cards you have, no matter how much kritiks, it won't matter unless you address the actual issue that the topic is presenting.
  
 Winning the round-
What I will be looking for the most in my debate rounds is counter-plans and constructive attacks on flaws of your opponents argument. Your speaker points will give you an incredible boost, but will not determine your overall placement in the round. Again, to reiterate, passion, and the ability to present arguments in a clear, constructive way whilst taking realism into consideration, will ultimately win you the round.
