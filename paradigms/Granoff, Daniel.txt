  I've got a reasonably high threshold for abuse, so don't run theory unless you really have to. Please set up a clear framework for the round that you can link back to. V/VC structure is something I'm used to and like, though not necessary if you justify other structures. Speed is fine, but please signpost and slow down for tag lines so I don't get lost. If I can't understand you, I'll clear you once or twice but if you keep it up its your own fault.
