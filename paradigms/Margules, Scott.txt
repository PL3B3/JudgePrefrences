I am a parent of a student who does Student Congress and have been actively judging Congress, PF and LD for the last two years for University School. My profession is law and I am a practicing attorney. I really enjoy judging debate and take notes, but those notes are not what most would consider a national circuit flow. While I'm not philosophically opposed to any debaters going fast it's important that you do not spread and do not go too fast that I cannot understand the clash that you are making. This is a wonderful activity - have fun in the round!
