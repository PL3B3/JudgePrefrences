Judging Paradigm: 

I'm not one in favor of spreading. I'd very much appreciate a clean, clear, and articulate debate. 
I'd also appreciate mutual decency amongst the debaters. Nothing overly rude. Use humor, sas, and sarcasm to further your argument not belittle your opponent. 

That's pretty much about it.
