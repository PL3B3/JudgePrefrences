  Background:
I did LDl for 1.5 years at Corona Del Sol High School in Arizona.

Speed: Go moderate speed and make sure you are clear. Make sure you road-map and signpost very clearly.

Evaluation: I will look at any arguments you make as long as they are not unwarranted and you must show me how that applies to the topic, your position, your opponents position and the impacts.

Theory: I am not too familiar with theory, so if certain positions are abusive, take the time to clearly articulate the interpretation and violation and why I should vote down the abuse.

Voting: I will vote for the person who wins the most important arguments in round that impact back to the winning criterion (absent some alternative framework for evaluation) but speaker points are given to most eloquent speaker with the best quality/written arguments.
