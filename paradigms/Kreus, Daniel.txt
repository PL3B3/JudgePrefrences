Experience: I am currently a third year debater at Dartmouth College (2 time qualifier to the NDT), and debated for four years at Wheeler High School.

1. Debate should include both policy and critical arguments. You should debate the way you want to debate, not how you believe I want you to debate.
2. You will have a difficult time convincing me conditionality is bad unless they read more than two conditional advocacies.
3. A dropped argument is a concession.
4. An argument requires a claim and a warrant. If your "argument" doesn't meet this threshold, it's not a real argument.
5. Be nice.
