  My name is Chaitali Chanda.
1) In case you don't know, this is who I am:


So to answer your first question,

YES I AM QUALIFIED TO JUDGE YOU. 
 (If you don't understand the photo above, you're probably going to lose anyway so don't bother reading the rest)


2) I am on the third month of my cleanse diet. All I eat is lemon juice, bell peppers, and water for all three meals each day. I'm going to look amazing. Naturally, as a result, I have mood swings and am often cranky and hungry.

SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
 
3) Does the debate community discriminate against you? Do you have a touching narrative about your experiences as a queer woman of color? Do you believe that debate is a fluid contest of ideas that is up to the debaters to shape? Do you have radical visions for debate and an even more revolutionary idea about how to get there?

I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
 JUST RUN A POLITICS DA.
 FOR ALL EXTENSIVE PURPOSES, I WILL ASSUME YOU ARE NOT SO STUPID OR POOR THAT YOU CAN'T CUT POLITICS UPDATES.
 
Good luck to both teams.

P.S. I have a terrible poker face, which can either help or harm you because people can rarely decipher what my facial expressions mean. For example, what do you think this expression means? 




Probably not what you think...<3
