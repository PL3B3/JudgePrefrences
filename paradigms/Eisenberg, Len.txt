2007/200 Half a dozen PoFo rounds and a couple dozen IEs
2008/2009 Two dozen LD rounds, a dozen Parli rounds and a couple dozen IEs

Combatants do not need to road map their argument at the beginning of the round, but do need to very carefully signpost through the round. Make sure I know if you are on Value or Criterion or Contention 1A, etc. During rebuttals make sure you signpost your opponents case “With regard to your contention 2C…”, With regard to your Contention 2D, etc.”
My goal is to carefully flow the debate, and evaluate the arguments, and I need to know what the heck you are talking about to do this.
Speed: I prefer slower over faster, but if you signpost very clearly faster is ok. You will get more speaker points for speaking clearly and well over just rapidly pouring words out your mouth.
I usually find that debates are decided on the back and forth over contentions, impacts, etc. rather than the value and criterion set up.
Lastly, I will not tolerate insulting or rude behavior toward the judge or debating opponent, and if this occurs I will vote you down, no matter the merits of the debate. Sorry, I am old school on this one, so be forewarned.
