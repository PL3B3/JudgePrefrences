I debated for LaPorte High School for four years. I qualified for TFA State, NFL Nationals and was the Undefeated UIL and NFL District Champion in Lincoln-Douglas debate. I mainly did LD, but do have experience in many other forensic events including policy as well. When judging I prefer more traditional forms of debate, which is not to say I won't listen to contemporary arguments. I evaluate the value and value criterion debate higher than simple clash on the contentions which i see more as supportive for the value and vc structure. I am fine with speed but do believe that speed should not be used as a crutch to avoid both clash and coherency within the round. Unclear, and unproductive spreading will result in a lower amount of speaker points for the debater. Clarity in both arguments and speech are highly emphasized in both constructives and rebuttals. I believe there is no room for counterplans, dissads, and kritiks. They are to be left in policy debate rounds. If however the resolution, AC, or NC warrants some form of kritikal ground and the link is highly applicable certain "non traditional" aruments may be run. Clarity is of the essence in a round and though line by line isn't always nessesary, I prefer to see a thorough debate with both big picture overviews as well as crystalization of key arguments in the round. It is not nessesary to win the entire flow but rather the most important arugments, because of this rebuttals should focus on imporant arguments rather than trying to fit an entire round in five minutes.


- Good luck to all!
