  I debated for three years for Lower Merion High School, a school in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Since graduating in 2010, I have had very little experience with Lincoln-Douglas debate. My involvement in debate is mostly though my college's Parliamentary Debate team and community service efforts. 

While I can handle speed and theory, I really don't like it, so you probably shouldn't run it in front of me. Everyone gets higher speaker points when I enjoy judging a round! Your best bet would to treat me like a parent judge, but be fairly confident I won't vote against you for stupid reasons like "I didn't like your tie." 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
