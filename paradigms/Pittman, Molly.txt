Judging Philosophy:

Evaluation: I evaluate rounds based on value/standards debate. If an argument precedes the standard, it must be clearly explained why. Impact back to the standard and make sure to weigh voting issues in the 2NR and 2AR.

Blocks: please, please, please don't read pre-written blocks that do not apply to your opponent's arguments! Be present in the round and have enough confidence in your arguments to make them round-specific. I'm okay with reading evidence in rebuttals but make sure it's applicable instead of simply handy. Same goes for theory shells.

Speed: I'll come clean and swallow my pride - I can't handle speed. When LD'rs read so quickly they develop those weird policy ticks like repeatedly mashing down their hair or swaying back and forth with the timer as a kind of weird maraca (you know who you are), I get distracted and want to laugh and definitely can't understand what you're saying. If you read your case at warp speed, I'll get as much as I can but you should take care to explain the important arguments you intend to extend later in the round.

Theory Debate: only run theory if there has been a clear violation in the round.

Positional Debate: my favorite kind.
