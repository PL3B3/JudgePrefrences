  I am a parent judge who only judges one or two tournaments a year. That
means you need to make the round very clear for me. Explain clearly why your
world is better than your opponent's and have clearly extended and labeled
voters. I prefer fluent debaters and eye contact. I'm also a lawyer so I'm
hesitant to vote off arguments I find personally untrue or not logical. I am
familiar with basic philosophy but do not understand "critical" cases. In
general, go slow and be clear/persuasive and you'll earn my ballot. This
does not mean dumbing down your arguments, rather making logical ones.
