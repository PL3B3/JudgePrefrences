General overview
-I don't debate in college, so I'm not caught up on all the latest literature
-I'm okay with most of the arguments in debate, however clearly explain your points
-I value the structure of debate and the rules regarding speech times (no 3nr and no extended speeches)
-Debate should be a safe environment, the use of racist/sexist/homophobic language will not be tolerated
-Humor is always appreciated so long as it doesn't go to far
-I'll never reject arguments just because I don't like them, just know that your job is to persuade me and some arguments aren't as persuasive as others.
-as far as in round ethics challenges go I prefer not hear about it unless its legitimate for example card clipping have some kind of proof to back an ethics challenge (take note of the last word you hear for the card and if it was clipped bring it up before cross-x, I'll handle it from there)

T
-I don't usually vote on T unless the Aff truly untopical/your arguments for T are better then the other team or if T is dropped
-I will vote on Aspec and the like if explained well and it isnt challenged well enough

Disad
-Links either link to the Aff or they don't
-If the Aff uses a link turn and Impact turn I will laugh
-As for politics/econ I'm not caught up the latest developments outside what I hear on the news so explain the disad in detail to avoid confusion

Counterplan
-I'd rather not see consult and conditional counterplans very often
-Solvency advocates are a must, Aff teams should make arguments about what it means to have a solvency advocate
-Perms need net benefits
-Don't be abusive

K
-I'm not well read on K material so be sure to take your time to explain all the aspects of the K
-saying “Perm do the plan and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the alternative” is not an argument explain the perm
-I do not appreciate it when a K is filled with buzzwords instead of actual content
-Just like with the Neg the Aff's arguments needs to have content as apposed generic K arguments
-Just like with Counterplans Perms must have net benefits

Theory
-I don't usually vote on theory however I understand it has its place in debate however you have to convince me to vote on it
