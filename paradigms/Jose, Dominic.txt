I debated at Maine East high school for 4 years and I enjoy cp disad debates over the K. I evaluate T in a competing interpretations aspect and theory debates have to be debated well with strong analysis. I do see dropped arguments to be 100 percent true and I believe beating disads with logical args without evd is possible. I love politics but that means I like it being debated well with good warrants and clear overviews of your evd explaining the scenario. Overall i'm a chill guy if your going for the K in front of me make sure you are extending everything in the end of the round, i like to have a picture of what the alt is before i vote on it.
