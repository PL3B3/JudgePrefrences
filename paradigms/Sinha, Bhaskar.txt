  I did high school debate (policy) in MA. I can handle spreading. I try to be a blank slate so all arguments and approaches will be considered. My personal opinions are irrelevant. Don't drop arguments. Don't make new arguments in rebuttal. Use cross-ex effectively because it does count. Aggressiveness and sarcasm are fine, avoid insults and foul language.
