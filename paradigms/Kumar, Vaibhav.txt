Background
Senior (and actively debating) at Alpharetta High School
2A for four years (never been a 2N)

Rounds
Constraints: Alpharetta HS
Quick Overview: Read anything- I have my obvious constraints and pre dispositions which will be discussed below. You should read arguments you’re the most comfortable on, but this is not a replacement for sketchiness or trickery. Have fun! That’s why we do this activity

Anything not covered or explained here? Ask me anything you need to before rounds, and/or email me whenever –vaibhavkumar238@gmail.com


The quick version:
1. Be Nice!- We all do debate because of the educational value we gain from it and the friends we make in it. Make sure you always respect everyone in the room- your partner, opponent, and judge.
 *There is a difference between being assertive and being rude. Don’t cross that line or it will affect your speaks. 
2. Impact CalcFraming­- This is the most important to me. Tell me how I should look at the debate after the round is over. This is especially true with the last rebuttals (but should be started earlier). You need to explain the impact and compare it with other impacts. Along with these come framing issues on how I should look at the overall debate. This needs to be explained because the last thing I wanna hear is “Look at the UQ debate through the lens of PC” and no explanation. These framing issues also need to be answered and compared- these are the best debates to judge. 
3. Evidence Comparison- I love LOVE LOVE good evidence. Compare it. Tell me why yours is better and why I should look at it first. I will NOT read cards after a round unless I need to. 
*Default to our evidence because it is newer is not an argument- give me a reason on why
4. Jokes- I am open to lots of jokes and I really wanna hear that. My partner has been Sachin Kashibatla for four years and I debated with Harrison Hall at camp. If you know either than them you should know I am pretty good with jokes/trolls. (don’t cross the line tho). If you make a good joke and I send it to Harrison Hall and Joel Veizi and they both give it above a 29 I will add .1 speaks. 
5. Tech o/w Truth all the time- This has two parts. In a debate if the other team out techs you even if they are wrong on something I will vote on tech. Secondly, I think that you can read ANY argument in debate but I think reading arguments like death good, racism good, suicide rhetoric good, etc. can get beaten VERY VERY VERY easily and will affect your speaks DRASTICALLY. 

DA:
- Probably my favorite negative position 
- I would always love a politics case throw down.
- Clear impact comparison, as said before- you need to do specific turn’s case stuff. War turns the environment is not a good turns case. DA’s that access the internal link of the aff are the best
- Carded turns case arguments are so so so important. 
- Subpointing is very important and makes flowing easy- if you do this your speaker points will be rewarded. 


CP:
- Specificity specificity specificity- The more specific the better for you- make sure it is competitive- remember I was a 2A so I am more aff leaning on competition but don’t take this as a free ticket aff- explain the competition arguments well
- I HATE THE WORD JUDGE KICK- As Andrea Reed said at camp- “What is judge kick? Say it one more time and I will judge kick you in the face!” 
- The negative should not have fiat ;)


K:
- I have not read as much into K literature so I am not as familiar with some arguments. I REALLY do like some K’s such as neolib (@Fangwei) and security but if you are those one off Death K’s or K’s (@Reed) that make me rethink my existence I am not the best judge for you.
 - These also have implications- link debate is hella important like most other judges- CONTEXTUALIZE IT TO THE AFF- I hate K debates that are general but I LOVE K DEBATES THAT ARE SPECIFIC- I want to know what about the aff is neoliberal or securitizes, what epistemology is bankrupt, etc.
 - I dislike 2NC’s that start off and spur “ k tricks”- if I hear “Fiat is illusory”, “serial policy failure”, and the Kappler card in ten seconds I might start laughing.
- I am not Buddhist


Case: Love this so much. Do some research and make it specific. NOTHING and I repeat NOTHING is better when you embarrass the aff team in CX, because YOU did research on THEIR aff.
*Please don’t be the team that just reads impact D- specific 1AC indicts and internal link defense will be rewarded BUT I do think that impact D is important in the 2NC so the aff cant just claim try or die. 


Non-Traditional ArgumentsFramework:
- I am friends with Joey Weideman and we love FW. This is where my biggest problem comes down for me. I think that the affirmative has to defend a topical governmental plan. I am REALLY convinced by framework argument so please try to adapt to your judge- if you are unable too just know that it is an very big uphill battle for me.
- Just remember friends - Framework makes the game work. 

T:
- I like these debates
- The 2NR and 2AR should do two things-
 1. Explain how the negative’s vision of debate via their interpretation is bad and vice versa for the affirmative.
 2. Compare evidence such as the counter interpretation- explain why one is better and why I should prefer one- these are the important in these debates as it chooses what interpretation I should side with. 
- Limits and grounds are great

Theory:
- DON’T BE BLIPPLY
- This needs to be impacted well by both sides of the debate
- As a 2A, I lean aff on somethings but I can very easily be convinced both ways. If you are reading more than 2 conditional advocacies why stop at 3. Just read 6. One great debater from Iowa City once said "Picking between conditional options is like picking between your favorite kids. You just don't do that"- Joey Weideman or better known as Hegemon66. 
Neutral- condo
Negative- International CP, Multiplank CP (limit though), Logical CP with no solvency Advocate, PIC in literature 
Affirmative- PIK, Word PIC, ConsultProcess CP (uncompetitive CP)
- "Do things to the other team, that if they were your dog you would go to jail" - Dave Arnett


Random
1. I love email chains- save time for all of us. If it is a flashdrive no preparation for flashing (unless we are low on time) BUT don’t be annoying about this. 
2. Update your wiki- I know I have no control over this but if I come into a round and the other team is not aware of past 1NC strategies and past 1AC’s read it will jack your ethos and cred infront of me- it might affect some speaks as well. 
3. Dont clip- you will lose
