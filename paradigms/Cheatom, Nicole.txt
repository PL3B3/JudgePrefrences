  I've been out of high school now for two years. I currently attend Baltimore city community college. I debated four years of high school and two years of middle school. My debate style varied from year to year which means I am very open minded and willing to listen to any case. I never voted for anything morally repugnant. I like speed and love to watch debates with plenty of clash. I see myself as strictly a judiciary official. I will never interject any personal knowledge or beliefs into a debate round. If you do not do the work i will not vote for you. I see the impact analysis as my reason for decision so you should always make that a focal point.
