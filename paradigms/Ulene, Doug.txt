I am a relatively new judge and have been trained by the local NY league. My son is a senior debater. I have watched but not judged some national circuit rounds. Important things to consider - relative inexperience with fast debate. Clarity and explanations required.
Directly from Doug:
"Please speak slowly, loudly and clearly enough for me to understand everything you have to say. Signposting is critical for me to flow the round effectively.Finally, make sure to crystallize your arguments and tell me how to write the ballot."
Full disclosure - this paradigm was written by Joe Vaughan
