  Hello all,

My background is 3 years of LD Debate, mostly at the JV level.

I am not a fan of spreading but can understand most speeds short of the full spread.
If I don't understand what you said, I won't consider it in the debate.

I'll vote mostly off the flow, but it is important you give me some voters in the end.

In LD it is essential to not neglect the value and value criterion debates as often they're your link to victory.

Have a good time debating!
