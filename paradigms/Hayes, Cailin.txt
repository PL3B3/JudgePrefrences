  I am fairly new to judging policy debate and competed for 2 years in high school. In other words, I won't follow extremely complex and theoretical arguments. I really like it when competitors can engage in on-case arguments, and I appreciate a creative or well-thought out T argument, but won't vote for T unless it is clear that there is a violation. Counterplans and DAs are great and definitely encouraged. I just don't like K. You can run it and still win, but make sure you are able to really explain what the kritik is about and why the AFF is in violation of that and why I should care.
