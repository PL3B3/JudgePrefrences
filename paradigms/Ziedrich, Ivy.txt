Experience: 3 years HS parli, 1 year HS pufo, in NPDA now.
General: 
I vote on the flow and default to net benefits. Your aesthetic performance will not impact your speaks as much as your debate skills. If your in-round conduct is offensive, expect your speaker points to reflect that. If your opponents are offensive, make that a major voting issue. I don't think I should have to bring this up, but I've seen enough racism and sexism in high school rounds that apparently I do. In general, I encourage you to make the round entertaining and have fun.Flowing: 
I'll let you know if I can't understand your speed. Please slow for taglines or anything you want on my paper in detail. If I'm not flowing, you either make no sense or should move on.Preferences: 
I'm down to listen to any theory debate you want to have so long as there's a reason for it. Don't use procedurals as time sucks, and don't run spec if it's not essential to ground. I'm not okay with you excluding your opponents from the round--so slow down when they call clear and don't expect me to weigh the round on any framework that excludes the other team. I probably won't. That said, I'll vote on most things so long as you win on it. Please do not rely on cards to compensate for a lack of analysis. If I'm not voting on anything pre-fiat, I'll be weighing your impacts to determine the round. The value/value criterion debate should be a means of weighing cases in general against each other, but I will still be looking at each case, so please have distinct impacts. Not everything is dehum. Not everything is nuke war. That's okay. "Improves the economy" and "violates the constitution" are not enough for me, however. 
If you have any questions about my paradigm or a specific round, please ask me questions anytime. If you can't find me, facebook me.
