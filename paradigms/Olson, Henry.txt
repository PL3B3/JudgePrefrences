  I am huge on argument explanation and delivery. I would prefer that you have one incredibly well-developed argument to eight underdeveloped ones (that being said, if you can develop and explain all eight well, go for it). When it comes to speed, I can keep up if you are clear. Basically, use Eminem's "Rap God" or "Speedom" verses as a gauge.
