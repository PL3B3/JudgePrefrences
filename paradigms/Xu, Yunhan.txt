I debated in high school and college. Last tournament I judged was the 2014 TOC, so please go a tad slower and assume no prior topic knowledge.

These were my preferences a few years ago—
Do what you do best. I have no strong ideological preferences, and generally value form over content.A dropped argument is only consequential when paired with a warrant and impact.If you must go for theory, clearly explain why your interpretation is better and why, therefore, I should reject the argument or team. Topicality debates with thick evidence comparison and impact analysis are good. Reading long agent counterplan blocks at top speed is less good.Total defense is possible.
Be respectful—to the other team, your partner, the activity, and so on.
