  General: Do not run post-modernist or critical philosophy in front of me. I will not be able to follow your arguments. Treat me as a traditional judge. After years away from the activity, I now favor practical arguments over pure philosophy.

Speed: Clear communication is preferred. Please keep in mind that I have not debated in over four years, so if you go fast, I will likely miss important arguments and not be able to keep up. 

Theory: I am not someone to run theory in front of unless absolutely necessary. I will not even consider theory unless there is obvious abuse in the round. 

Speaks: Be respectful to your opponents in round. I have no problem giving debaters the maximum possible number of points. Just be clear, articulate in your thoughts, and refrain from any underhanded tactics (such as lying about the amount of prep time left).

CX: I enjoy a good cross examination. Refrain from just asking clarification questions. 

Other: I appreciate being given a clear decision calculus. I have no interest in intervening or doing any amount of work for either debater. Therefore, please consider weighing your arguments. Signposting and crystallization are important.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask before the round.
