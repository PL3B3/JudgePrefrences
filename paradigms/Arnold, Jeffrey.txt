  I was involved in speech and debate all four years in high school and have a generally well rounded experience. I primarily competed in LD debate and have judged it previously at tournaments.

I am open to most anything in a debate round as long as it makes sense and you can tie it all together. I am not a fan of people spreading. however, I understand the need to speak quickly. It comes down to if I cant understand you then I will not be able to judge you on it. I will flow the rounds and if you see me stop flowing or obviously confused then its probably to your advantage to slow down. I will vote mostly off of the flow but make sure to give me voters at the end of the round. Also dont forget your value and value criterion.

Generally be friendly to your opposition and keep everything tied together, I am ok with unusual as long as you can make it work for the resolution and for the round.

Good luck and I will see you in the round!
