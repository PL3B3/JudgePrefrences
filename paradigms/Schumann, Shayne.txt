  I was a policy debater for four years in high school. I judge frequently around the Austin area.

Policy: I am pretty open to anything in a round. I don't have any preference on types of arguments I like or want to hear in the round. I like for both teams to give me some kind of framework to weigh the round by but if one isn't given I will default to whichever team has the most offense left on the flow. I am fine with speed. T is not a big voter for me but I default competing interp unless another framework is given. Make sure you have a clear alt on K. Other than that just signpost along the way and be specific about where you want things put on the flow. 

LD: I am fine with any kind of argument. I like a good value/criterion debate but I am fine with theory and lots of observations if they are warranted. If a framework is not given I will default to the debater who better achieves his or her V/C. I am fine with speed. Signpost along the way. Feel free to ask any questions about specific types of arguments.
