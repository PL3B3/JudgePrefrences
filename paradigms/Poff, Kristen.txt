I am the debate coach for Randolph High School in NJ and I have been judging PF and LD for three years. I consider myself a traditional judge, so please keep the following in mind:
Not a fan of spreading, so if you are unclear, I will not assume your new extrapolations are true in later speeches if I didn't have the argument flowed originallyI don't have much experience with Theory/T, so don't read it unless there is a very clear abuse story. Still, a full explanation of the implications of your theory argument is necessary for me to evaluate it.Same goes for Kritiks, but if you decide to read them, err on the side of over explanation.
Things that I like/get better speaks:
Good argument comparisonWeighingVoice inflection when speaking (monotonous spreading is not enjoyable to listen to)Respecting your opponentDominant CX's without being rude
Try to learn something new, and have fun!!
