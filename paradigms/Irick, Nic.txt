  I like debate. Tell me why you should win and I will vote for you. I am a policy maker be default but will vote for the winners of the round. I dont like T it is not a persuasive argument in my mind. Impact turns are my fav argument in my mind and I would love to see more of them. I debated in HS and college. More than anything i want teams to run arguments that they think they can win and then i want them to win them. If they tell a story along the way that helps too.
