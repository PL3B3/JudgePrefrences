  What's up? My name is Devane and I like long walks on the beach, chocolate, puppies and tickle fights

Oh yeah, I also debated for Newark Science for 4 years and currently debate for Rutgers. As far as what i care about in the debate round goes: 

FIRST AND FOREMOST, I know NOTHING of this topic (Latin America) so please ease me in to the acronyms and stuff you'll use

CP - They're A OK with me. But I do know what it means for a CP not to solve an aff. So just cause you run it and it sounds good i need some substantial evidence as to why I should vote on it. 

DA - I love this style of debate because even if you mess up the explanation of the DA i can still put 2 and 2 together. 

Ptix - I'm kind of a specialist here and would love to here some good Politics debate. 

K - This is where most of my 2nrs were as a high school student so I would love to hear it. But please I am not Nietzsche nor Baudrillard so don't expect me to know everything. i will evaluate these whatever way I'm told to. I would however like to see some comparative analysis of the permutation and the alternative in the rebuttals. Convince Me. 

K affs - I'm in college so these are pretty normal to me. I don't think you have to defend the resolution but if you don't please don't confuse. Gimme some direction to vote in. Like anything.

Speaks - i guess this is an important one. I love to laugh ... like alot so if you are able to make me laugh without being a douche your speaker points will reflect that. I will yell clear twice and then my pen goes down. 

Theory - just do it. i don't care. i love Condo and Condo loves me. 

AND PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME HAVE TO VOTE ON ASPEC - I DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING CURSED OUT BY ANY COACH - THANK YOU
