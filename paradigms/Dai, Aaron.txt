Experience: 3 years of policy debate at Houston Memorial High School
I have not done Policy for about 3 years now, so please be clear when presenting your arguments
Overview: I usually go for the team that can best defend the status quo or advocate the counterplan. Impact calculus is important. If you can convince me that your plan is the best policy to undertake, and is sufficiently warranted you’ll win the round. 
Flowing: I am not the fastest writer, so I flow taglines and authors with portions of the card itself. Please be clear when you are spreading.
The T: Topicality is a big voting issue for me. Depending on the topic, I will have slight biases. However, the side that is able to make the most compelling argument (eg. One critical impact, harm, etc) will usually get my vote.
Disads: They’re ok, but don’t make half the speech disads. Balance is key.
CP: Fine, but limit yourself to only one. In terms of arguments, it is better to make a few concise, strong args rather than making many poorly-structured ones.
K’s: They are fine, but limit yourselves in terms of numbers of those arguments, don't just try to deconstruct the entire arg. I want to see clash 
Decision: Extinction, death, war, or any significant harm, if warranted sufficiently, will win the round I don’t usually call for cards unless absolutely necessary. In addition, I will take into consideration issues of racism, sexism, etc. 
Misc: Try not to swear during your speeches and CX’s. I won’t take off speaks for that, but conduct is still very important to me. 
Speaks: I’m usually pretty generous with speaker points. Unless you make an absolutely atrocious speech, you will get a 25 or above.
Other notes: With regard to impact calculus: warrant your impacts (i.e. give me concrete reasons as to why your impacts outweigh your opponents, simply asserting "we outweigh" will not suffice.
