  I am the coach of First Colonial High School Debate Team (2009-present)

LD Paradigm (5 points to consider) - I will try to keep this short and simple. I love judging LD and I try my absolute best to keep an open mind towards whatever you want to throw my way :)

Speed - I can keep up, but no spreading please. Please remember that clarity matters (quality > quantity)

Theory - You want to throw a Kritik out, fine. You just need to know what you are actually talking about and you need to clearly explain its usage/relevance for me to flow it. But hey, I like getting weird and encourage debaters to challenge and stretch themselves.

Etiquette - Please look at your judge during cross-ex. I am okay with you being aggressive, in fact I would prefer it (but overt rudeness will hurt speaker points). Try to remember that aggressively advocating for your position does not have to include rude behavior (scoffing, giggling, rolling your eyes, etc...) towards your opponent.

Organization - Please remember that I have to flow both sides. Please try to address your opponents points in order of which they are presented (and do the same when addressing your opponents rebuttals). When you crystallize the round, give me clear/concise reasons that I should vote for your side. 

Lastly - Please do not say, "they did not really attack this or that, thus it stands" - It's fine if they actually said literally nothing about certain parts of your case, but don't assume I will just flow something to your side... compel me to vote on your side.
