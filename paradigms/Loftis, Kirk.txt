  I'm a parent judge that can handle spreading but I prefer traditional case structure (Value/Value Criterion) rather than K's or Plans/Counterplans. Only debate theory if your opponent is actually being abusive. Be polite and courteous; proper etiquette does matter to me but I will not vote off of it. Delivery and clarity of argumentation will determine your speaker points. Be persuasive! I do not evaluate offensive arguments (rape/racism good, etc). As long as you give me a clear ballot story and explain all of your arguments/how they function in contrast with those from your opponent clearly, you will be fine. Best of luck and have fun!
