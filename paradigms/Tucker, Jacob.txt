I have been out of the debate world for about two and a half years now and am just beginning to judge again, mostly through LAMDL. If anything, I think my time away from debate has given me a much higher academic standard for arguments and quality of evidence.

General:
Run whatever you want.Prep time stops when the flash drive leaves the computerI will be objective as possible. Any biases listed below probably will not effect my decision in any way.Defense is underutilized and undervalued
More Specific:
Counterplans: Consult/Conditions cps are cheating and illegitimate. This doesn't mean I won't vote for them or even that they shouldn't be run, especially if they have specific solvency advocates. Just be ready to defend their legitimacy. Conditionality is good, but I might be persuaded otherwise. PICs written specifically for the plan make for good debates.

Kritiks: I've run a lot of them. I'm familiar with most of the literature. A criticism should criticize the aff, not just the world as a whole. Make it as specific as possible.

Topicality: It's a voter. Impacts in context of the aff will mean better speaker points and lessen the chance of intervention.
