I debated in high school for two years, I graduated from high school in 2011 this is my first year judging

kritics: I'm fine with them I know how to evaluate them, they are a pretopical arguement so if you run them then make sure your k goes through first or kick it, second for those of you who hit a k make sure you attack it well and that you delink, perm, or show that the alternative has no solvency

disads: I'm fine with these and I will evaluate them under the framework of the round, if you are neg and you run these and you dont have any framework i will evaluate them under the aff's framework.

plans/counterplans: I'm fine with these but make sure that you solve, and if you are fiating something then tell me why it should be fiated.

topicality: make sure it follows the standard form and if you want me to vote on it make sure it has a voter this I consider to be a pretopical arguement so again like the k if your oppenent runs this on you, you should respond to it first. 

theory: same goes for theory, follow the standard form and give it a voter otherwise I wont vote off of the theory no matter how compelling it is, also like topicality and the k this is a pretopical arguement so make sure you respond to this first.

unanswered arguments: if your opponent doesn't respond to it doesn't mean that you just saying it wasn't attacked give it any wait it will allow it to remain a relevant argument though, but if you want me to vote for it then you need to explain how it affects the round 

dropped arguements: dont count in the round 

as far as values and criterians are considered I consider the Criterian/standard to wiegh the round and determine whether or not the value has been achieved with that said don't use your values as a second criterian its very bothersome, and dont use more then one criterian it really eats your time and all the justifications I've scene for them so far are not good so just dont do them.

ultimately I like rounds where the competetors are telling me how I should vote based on good arguments and telling me how i evaluate those arguments vs their opponents. the easier you make it for me to vote for you the more likely i am to vote for you, this also makes for a much clearer round.
