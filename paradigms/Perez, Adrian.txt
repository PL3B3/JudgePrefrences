I try to evaluate things based on the flow but I also do care about argument quality and speaking style, that being said if there are obvious holes in your arguments it will be hard for me to just ignore them. I think impact weighing and comparing is a very important part of debate. Don't read anything really odd or sketchy in front of me. Don't speak too fast, but you don't have to go super slow either. You must win your own case to win the debate round and your impacts must be the most important under whatever framework ends up winning the debate. Be respectful to your opponents and have fun. If you do not use prep time you will get 30 speaker points. Also, I really like g2s, if you can win the round and you're using a bic pen then you will get higher speaks.
