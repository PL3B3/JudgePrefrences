  I am a Government major at Cornell University and I competed in LD for Mercyhurst Prep for four years.

I am a very traditional judge. Lincoln-Douglas is first and foremost a value based debate; I love to see arguments based on logic and philosophy rather than data packed cases and millions of cards. Be able to support your claims and link them back to your value structure. 

The fact that I am traditional also means that I do not tolerate spreading. If you spread and I can't understand what you're saying, I will drop you. Also, please keep policy terms out of the debate and remember that the focus of LD is NOT 'solvency' - this burden cannot be laid on your opponent.

CX - I generally don't flow cross-examination. If something important comes up, make sure you bring it up in your next speech. 

Keep it classy!
