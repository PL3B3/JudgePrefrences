  I debated in high school from 1994-1997. I started in CX and crossed over to LD. I have randomly judged rounds since 2000. In 2009, I started coaching debate at the high school level. My LD preferences are as follows:

Style:
I love it when a debater spreads, but make sure it is CLEAR. I am easily annoyed by what I call "whisper-spreading" or "studder-spreading." If you are slightly inclined to achieve the two previously mentioned characteristics, then just do not spread.On average, I am comparatively generous when I award speaker points, but I hate, hate, hate rudeness. You should be debating, not critiquing your opponents. Phrases such as, “obviously, my opponent was not listening, because…blah, blah, blah…” will guarantee you low points. So, keep the round, civil, professional, and cordial. If you use profanity or inappropriate language in a round, then that indicates to me that you lack the maturity necessary for me to award you with high speaker points; sometimes, the ballot.
Substance:
Evidence = good, but make sure you provide me with analysis. Anyone can read paid research, but the ones that tend to earn my votes are well compared and well analyzed arguments. If you’re running kritiks, theories, or what have you, make sure the link is clear. Make sure it is a paradigm that you personally understand and extend throughout the round. Make sure that you are not merely reading a shell that your coach gives you. Make sure you explain why your point of view works. I’m open and have often times voted for innovative debate; but I hate sheep debates. In your last rebuttal, please make sure you provide me with voters. I should not be left open to predict or synthesize arguments on your behalf.
Good luck.
