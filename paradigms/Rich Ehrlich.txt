  I'm a parent judge from Coral Springs, FL. I will not be able to follow spreading very well. You can go quickly but just not spreading speed. Just make sure that your points are clear and that I can understand them. However, just because I can't flow spreading doesn't mean that you should dumb down your arguments for me. I've read a lot of philosophy from Plato's Republic to Rouseau's Social Contract so I should be able to understand what the argument is as long as it's explained well and gives me a clear reason to affirm or negate. A final thing is that I view cross-examination as a very important aspect of debate. Good cross-examinations will result in good speaker points.
