        Policy

    
    
        What is your competitive speech or debate experience?

        High school policy and Extemp

    
    
        High School

        Hendrickson High School

    
    
        College

        University of Houston

    
    
        Where have you coached?

        I have only debated, never coached.

    
    
        Approximately how many rounds have you judged this season?

        1

    
    
        How many years have you been judging?

        1

    
    
        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

         The Cougar Classic will be the first tournament that I will have formally judged. I’d prefer to hear what you are more familiar with reading and and are comfortable with rather than have you read something to adhere to my judging preferences. As far as where I lay on the left/right spectrum of arguments, I do have more experience dealing with policy oriented arguments, not to say that I am incompetent when it comes the kritikal arguments in the very least. If you know your argument, explain it well, and debate well, you get my vote.

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Make smart, reasonable analysis, are clear and efficient, have respect for their opponents and the activity, and maybe make me laugh.

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Definitely not a speaker point stickler, so as long as you do a good job, are respectful, and don't steal prep.

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        Case w/ DA or 2, Heideggar, Cap, Trash

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        Anti-blackness doesn't exist because Obama is president.

    
    
        Rate the following argument types

        Topicality: Okay
Theory: Okay
Counterplans: Alright
Disads: Alright
Kritiks: Alright
Framework: Alright
Speed/Spreading: Alright

    
    
        Explain your ratings, if you like

        Small notes:

Topicality - needs to be contextualized to the round by both sides. I evaluate T in offense/defense

Theory - like T, contextualize and explain how the how the round is negatively affected. I think theory is to reject the argument, but you can convince me otherwise.

CPs - Skeptical when the counterplan includes all of the plan, but I do like PICs that have good evidence that support a competitive net benefit.

Disads and Case - Love it. Favorite 2NR strat was a stong disad(s) with a few minutes of case. Specific case turns are devastating. (I was a 2A.)

Kritiks - Love it. Understand your argument, explain the alternatives well, and try not to utilize generic links. 

Policy teams - Pretty straightforward. Impact calc is very important. If you bank on a few cards, I'll probably look at them at the end.

K/method teams - Do your thing, explain your argument, what it means for me as a judge at a debate tournament, and what my ballot does at the end of the day. Tell me what your interpretation of an argument is and why you've won.

    
    
        Comments on flowing or speed:

        I'm comfortable with speed. As long as your clear, we're good. Maybe slow down on the plan text/CP text, because I want to be able to write those down.

    
    
        Other things a team should know about?

        This will be the first tournament I've formally judged after graduating last year. That also means that I am pretty behind on this year's topic arguments and literature. I only say this in the case that you're reading some policy aff with a bunch of topic specific acronyms, or something else of that nature, please elaborate. Oh, and flashing isn't prep, just don't be a jerk. I'm happy to answer any questions through email as well. Good luck :)
