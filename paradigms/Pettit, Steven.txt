  I am the assistant coach at Esperanza High School. I can judge any type of debate but am normally in the LD or the Policy pool. I have competed in High School and in College so I am ok with just about anything. Generally speaking I am good with speed. You get a three strikes rule with me. I will say clear three times and then I stop flowing. I am good with about 350 words per minute. Also, the only addendum to my speed rule is theory. If you are running complex theory then you better make sure that I know how you are applying it or else I won't vote on it.
LD: I like to see a lot of clash on the value/value criterion level. Impacts are cool but if they don't link to a standard then I don't know how to evaluate them; unless you explain how they are apriori. I am ok with T as long as you can prove in round abuse. \
Policy: I am a stock issues judge. I will judge on Impacts if that is what you tell me to do. T is ok only if you can prove abuse or significant ground loss. I am shaky on K's, but will vote on them if you can tell me how they function in round.
