  I'm the mom of a high school debater who has judged at a few local tournaments. I will take detailed notes during the round, but please do NOT spread and keep the jargon to a minimum. I know basic LD terms and the structure of a framework and case, but no theory, kritiks, or other unconventional arguments differing from the normal V-VC-contention structure. Please be persuasive and articulate your arguments clearly.
Thank you!
