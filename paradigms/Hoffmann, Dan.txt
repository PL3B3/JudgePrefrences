Four years of Junior Statesman debate, as well as Congress

I am looking for an argument based on good evidence, presented in a well-organized and concise manner. It is important to respond and potentially disprove the claims made by the other side in order to strengthen your argument. Will really only evaluate the arguments that are extended through to the 2NR and the 2AR.
