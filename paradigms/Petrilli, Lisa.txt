I am a lay judge, so please speak at a normal rate of speed if you want me to capture everything of importance. I realize this is not what national-circuit debaters want to do, but I believe truly great debaters are adept at adapting to and influencing their particular judge. Your best opportunity to earn my vote is to adapt.
  
  
 Additionally, my opinion on LD is that you’ve been asked to debate the topic at hand. In my mind there is no basis for an argument that the topic cannot be discussed until one of society’s ills is rectified. Furthermore, I believe that as young adults the least-empowering stance for you to take is that you are a victim. Hence, I do not look favorably upon any case that takes a victim stance.
  
 What I am best able to evaluate is a framework debate. I didn’t go to debate camp like many of you, so if you choose to run theory, k’s, counterplans and the like you must know that I will evaluate the round as best I can – and it may not be according to the way it’s “supposed” to be evaluated based on what you were taught at camp. That’s simply the risk you run. I will be exceptionally thoughtful in making my decision and I expect your respect of the final outcome.
  
 I also expect that you will treat me and your opponent with the utmost respect during round. Speaker points are based to some degree on this respect, along with thoughtful and complete arguments, well-supported arguments, poise, confidence, influence skills and clarity of your insights. If you challenge my decision, expect to lose speaker points. If you lose, it is because your opponent beat you in that particular round; choose to learn from the experience.
  
 Finally, I ask that you stand while making your case and during cross x. Thank you!
