 CLIFFS  (inb4 tl;dr)
- prep ends when the flash drive leaves the computer
- don't ask me my preferences, ask specific questions
- the kritik is fine, but pls go if you can't debate it well
- clarity>speed
- i pride myself on judging efficient and smooth debates, tech problems, wasting speech time, and/or inefficient prep use are my 3 biggest pet peeves (aka you're getting bad speaks) (srs)

If you don't have much time before the debate, read this.
- I'm relatively familiar with the topic. I judged 12 camp rounds this summer, but I heard the same aff over and over again. That means, I probably don't understand acronyms, so you'll have to say the whole phrase initially, and explain them.

- I can flow whatever speed - the only issue I have is flowing at the start of the speech. If you are going too fast, you'll notice because I won't flowing and too busy trying to understand you. Slow down!

- I am NOT the most well versed in kritik literature, but that is not to say I "hate the K". Debating the K in high school was always fun and interesting, so if it something you read, feel free to read it in front of me. My only caveat is that since I don't always understand the literature, you HAVE to make sure you adapt and really explain it well if it's complicated.

- Ideal 2NRs in the following order: Politics and Case, Politics and CP, impact turns. I love a good impact turn debate.

- Cheap shot arguments aren't my favorite, and will really only vote on them if they are dropped/horribly answered. If you need clarification on what I mean, ask me.

- Many teams are starting to read multiple CPs in debates. I love it.

How to get good speaker points:

- Don't be a jerk.

- Be organized. I cannot stress enough how important organization is in the eyes of a judge. Even if you are crushing the other team and you are disorganized/are having technical issues, it still looks perceptively bad.

- BE CLEAR. If I can't understand you or you are going faster than you should be, I won't flow your speech until you correct it.

How to lose my ballot:

- clipping cards and otherwise general cheating tactics. Don't do it.

Paperless thoughts:
- Prep ends when the speech on the jump drives leaves the computer, and is transferred to the other team. It does not end when the document is saved. I debated paperless and know all the prep-stealing ideas. When you say "end prep, i'm just saving" really means you're still prepping. So to attempt to rectify this, SAVE the speech and remove the jump drive, and then tell me you want me to end prep.


Performance Teams:
I think it's totally awesome and really respect that style of debate, I just don't think i'm the best judge yet for you.
