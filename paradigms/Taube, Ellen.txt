  I am a senior at Highland Park Senior High. I run mostly critical arguments. If you go for topicality make sure there is enough explanation as to why your interpretation should be preferred. I don't buy framework that completely excludes the K. However I will vote on framework as a way to view the round that could potentially take out pieces of an argument such as the alternative. I appreciate impact analysis. I tend to need less persuasion for reject the argument than reject the team.
