  My philosophy is rather simple. I do not appreciate nor tolerate the act of speaking extremely fast, or "spreading." I believe that doing so distracts from the true resoultion at hand and ultimately devalues the round. I look for clear, concise speaking and the ability to "go down the flow" when refuting an opponent's argument. If a debater does not argue against his/her opponent's value, value criteria, or contentions, I count it as a "drop" and this phenonomenon will subsequently result in a loss of the round.
