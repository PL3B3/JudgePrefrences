I am a judge with traditional preferences. I focus on the standards debate and how it interacts in the round, along with the contention level debate as well. 

I will buy any logical argument that can reasonably be connected to the resolution. However, I prefer a broader view of the resolution rather than an extremely narrowed one. 
I do not flow speed reading at or near the policy level.
