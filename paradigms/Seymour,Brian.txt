  I am a lawyer who has been judging since the 2016-2017 Debate year. I never debated in high school or college.
Always be respectful of your opponent and the Judge(s). Spreading is allowable. However, if I cannot understand the argument because you speak too fast, you cannot win the round. It is up to the debater to know where that limit is. It is also critical that the flow can be followed such that the argument is cohesive.
