  I debated at Mercedes High School for 4 years and had some swell times/success.

I'm rather friendly to kritik debates as I find these the most interesting. Just letting you know though, I'm not too down with super crazy authors with minimal association to the topic/what is being discussed so go a little easy and explain really well.

DAs/CPs are fine. I feel that too many however, are just card wars with little warranting or explanation. If you could remedy this and explain the arguments/warrants really well that would go a long way and may gain you some extra speaks. 

T - baller. I like T debates, just give good impact calculus like any other argument.

Offense over defense, chip-chip, cheerio, and all that business. Ask questions before round, I'm cool with that.

Last words - Please go slow on the tags, I'm not the fastest flow in the West, so yeah be a pal. Further, I've tried to emphasize this as much as possible, EXPLAIN your arguments, I feel like debaters don't explain things and flesh out arguments as much as they should/could, it really goes a long way with me.
