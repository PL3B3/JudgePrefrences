  
History - Debated at Jack C. Hays High School for 3 years, but never qualified for state. I moved to California then back to Texas in Fort Worth and debated for Fossil Ridge High School my senior year.

Framework- On the top like it should be. Competiting Frameworks are a necessity. If you run a K run some Framework please. only a joke.

General presentation preferences - No Rude. Rude Bad. waste of time to be rude.

Topicality - Competiting interpretations. I think on T that there has to be clash and a specific in round reason as to why not voting on T is bad. Have to win that reasonability is bad. Just in round Please none of this future malarky.

Disads - Don't double-turn and your fine.

Case Debate - Need specific Ev, turns solvency takeouts. Defense is winnable but not all the time.

Counterplans - I don't like PIC's or extremely abusive CP's but if you can win that it is justified because of a spectacular net benefit. sure.

Theory - Is fine. Not to much to put. Just make sure to explain everything and do not read the 30 POINT BLOCK. if so extend clearly.

Critiques - I understand critical theory and like the idea of critiques. I think that they are becoming very abusive and almost non-competitive. If it is well explained as to why the alternative competes with the AFF's plan then it is fine.

Critical Affs- Justify Justify Justify. nothing against them though

Speed- I am alright with speed just please be clear. I will only say clear once.

Sickness- Not an excuse.
