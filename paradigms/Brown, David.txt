  Tab judge for both CX and LD. I have a low threshold for theory and perfect speaks, as long as you are generally clear and have good technical skill and clean line-by-line. I have no preference on argument types. Ask questions before the round for specifics. I have generally researched topics and understand major arguments being run on each resolution. No problem with speed in rounds. Be polite for quality purposes and to guarantee perfect speaks. I have no preference to case/critical debate, but I would prefer everything be introduced in the 1NC. Anything else, just ask.
