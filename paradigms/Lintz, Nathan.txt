  I debated for four years at needham high school and qualled to the TOC my senior year with bids at scarsdale and harvard. I was in quarterfinals of the TOC.

Speed: I prefer fast rounds over slow rounds and good use of speed will earn you high speaks. A caveat is that you must be fluent in English. I don’t want to hear a jumble of umms and uh uh uhs or else I’ll be shouting at you. Please slow down for tags and author names.
Theory: I like good theory debates and my defaults are that: fairness is a voting issue and theory is an issue of reasonability.
Argumentation: I like framework debates, good policy style argumentation. I dislike generic stock positions.
Weighing/Arg Comparison: Please do this. Write my ballot for me and spend a good amount of time crystallizing your arguments for me.
Random Thoughts: I’m a fairly tab judge and will vote on whatever you tell me to. If you want good speaks, run cool stuff and do a good job explaining it and how it interacts with your opponent’s positions.
If you have questions, ask me before the round.

UPDATE PRE-LEX 2012:
I dont want to vote on the topic nullification argument or performance positions. I will have a pretty low threshold to reject these arguments so I don't suggest you run them in front of me.
