  I have judged several times before and I am tabula rasa. Both of my sons are and have been in the program, and I follow the activity closely and I am familiar with different argument styles. I prefer a more conversational rate versus spreading, but it is up to you. I will be weighing the impacts, which will have some influence on my judging.
