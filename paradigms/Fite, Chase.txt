  Speed is fine; be clear.
I will judge any type of argumentation including alternative weighing mechanisms, burdens, theory, kritiks, etc. so long as they are warranted, extended, and impacted. Be sure to clash your arguments against your opponentâ€™s arguments throughout the round and crystallize at the end. Tell me the levels of argumentation: what I should look to first and why you are winning it, what I should look to second, etc.
