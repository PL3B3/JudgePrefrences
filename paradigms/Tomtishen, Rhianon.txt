  Hi,

I didn't debate in high school but I understand argumentation. I will flow but I do NOT understand spreading so DO NOT DO THAT. I tend to prefer stock arguments but am open to kritical debate. I'm not a huge fan of theory but will vote for it if there is clear abuse demonstrated in the round. Feel free to ask me any questions before the round.
