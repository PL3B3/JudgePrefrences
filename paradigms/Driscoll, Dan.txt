Paradigm:
Be respectful. 

Spread at your own risk. If I can’t understand you, I will not flow the argument. If the argument is not on the flow, it will not factor into adjudication. 

The framework debate is critical. If you lose your framework, it will be very difficult for me to adjudicate in your favor. I am a traditional judge - the majority of the debate should focus on the primacy of your value and your criterion as a mechanism for its achievement. Depth of investigation will be privileged over breadth of argumentation. 

Extensions must be made explicit. I will not extend arguments unless I am told to, and unless they are weighed. KVI’s can be given however you wish, but they are required. 

Structure is up to you for the most part, but make sure to roadmap (off time) and signpost throughout your speeches.
