I am open to hearing any and all arguments as long as you're able to explain them to an extent where I can understand them. Don't expect me to do the work for you after the round is over. One of your top priorities should be to make your most important arguments as clear an evident to me as possible.

I prefer to hear policy arguments in a debate. However, I'm very familiar with the K and have no problem pulling the trigger on it for a ballot. That being said, if you're running something other than capitalism or Heidegger, you better know how to run/explain it. I obviously prefer a politics DA over a K, but thats just personal bias. I'm not easily persuaded on theory or topicality arguments unless you go all out for them and do it well.

Make the decision an easy one for me by doing your part.
