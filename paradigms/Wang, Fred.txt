Speaking/Speaker Points
Clarity and respect, as always, are well-rewarded—so is specificity. Blips and clips are not, and neither is stealing prep.
Please slow down on CP and plan texts.
Re-highlighting/reading their cards as arguments that go the other way is always fun and indicative of smart, attentive debating and preparation—just not in CX, please.

Counterplans
I tend to lean aff on CP theory questions (e.g., word PICs, consult, process, etc.) and to lean neg on condo, within reason.

Kritiks
Nuance and specificity are key; this is especially true for link analysis and alt explanations.
I’m not a fan of generics that do not interact with the aff. 
Assume I am not as well-versed in the literature as you are—that means minimize jargon or, at the very least, explain it thoroughly.

Non-traditional
Pretty good for the neg on framework but obviously, the arguments actually being made and executed in the debate matter more.
