  I'm a parent judge from Harrison High School in New York. I've only judged a couple times before. Please don't speak at a rate faster than conversational speed, or use more debate-oriented terms.

I won't adjudicate the round based on dropped arguments so much as considering who was more persuasive. 

Please debate about the topic
Time yourself 
Be persuasive
I will try to write down what I can
