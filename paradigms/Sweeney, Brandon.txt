I competed on a mainly traditional circuit. I have advanced to elimination rounds at several tournaments such as States, NCFLs, and Florida Blue Key. I prefer traditional rounds over progresive, but I am willing to listen to progessive arguments as long as they are not abused. 

Kritiks are ok as long as you don't spread them and clearly explain each part of the K. I am not all too familiar with all of the K arguments, so explain in depth. If I am lost, you have basically lost the round unless your opponent does not provide any reasons for me to vote for them. 

Theory should only be used for a clear abuse in the round. I am not ultra-specific with the trigger if I am clearly aware of an abuse in the round. Honestly, it would be easier if you just told me why the argument is abusive and save us both some time. I have dealt with abusive arguments, so I will probably agree with you if you articulate why. 

Speed: Don't spread, but you can speak quickly. If it looks like I am not catching things, you may want to slow down, for I will not call clear. Main thing is slow down for tagline and author's name. 

Generic Things: Speak clearly, do not read fast if you don't have to, give voters, give roadmaps, be polite and assertive.

Make this fun for all of us and good luck!

Feel free to ask any questions before the round
