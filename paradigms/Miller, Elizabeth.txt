  ***I am a traditional judge.

Speed- Do not spread. I can only flow so fast. Talking a little bit faster than normal is okay, but all of your words should be defined and clear.

Speaks- Being persuasive is very important to me. I want you to win me over with your words. I also want you to speak confidently and clearly. You need to sound intelligent.

Types of arguments- I am a traditional judge. This means no theory. You can run complex arguments like Kritiks if you like but just make sure you explain them well enough that I can understand them.

How I vote- If you are persuasive and all your arguments are logical that will win me over. If you are clearly winning offense and you spoke well then you will win.
