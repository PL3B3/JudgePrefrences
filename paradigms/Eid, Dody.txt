  Background
I did Policy Debate for Nashua High School South. I do not debate in college.

Arguments
Feel free to run anything and everything, but if you venture out of the traditional topical policy utilitarian framework, be clear and precise as to what you are trying to accomplish. In high school, I used to love running k affs and whatnot but I was really bad at it. Don't be me. If you're going to do it, do it well.
I understand most debate jargon but it would help tremendously if I don't need to know the jargon to make my vote.

Speed
I can understand most spreading but if you go into something like high theory please slow down and be clear.

How will I make my decision?
My ballot will rely heavily on the flow. If evidence clashes, it is on you, not me, to explain why one is better than the other. That being said, I love clash. 

Speaks
What I like
-Persuasive speech (clarity in speech, confidence, tone, style, etc..)
-Clarity, organization, structure
-Strong CX
-Creative, interesting displays and/or arguments done well
-Respect for opponents, the judge, the debate community, and yourselves

What I don't like
-Disorganization/chaos.
-Physical violence towards me or your opponent
-"They dropped Smith 07 so just sign your ballot now." Make the case that Smith 07 cannot be dropped.
-"Extend Smith 07" is not an argument on its own. If Smith clashes, then explain why Smith is better. I will likely ignore extensions without further discussion.
-Assuming I understand another language (If you want to speak another language for narrative/artistic purposes, go for it, but if there is something important to the literal interpretation of your argument, please express it in English)
-"Im emailing/flashing now" *types for a minute* "Ok all set"
-Personal attacks against your opponent. I'd prefer staying in the realm of argumentation.
-Arrogance

Misc.
You can use CX time to prep. Open CX is fine. I won't take prep time for emailing/flashing (don't abuse this). Add me to emails please.
