  Things About Me You Should Keep In Mind
Specificity: Specific arguments are better arguments, no matter the type. I'm equally suspicious of hinging the debate on an "all transportation infrastructure is racist" link alone as I am suspicious of hinging the debate on an "all transportation infrastructure is unpopular" link alone. Context is key. People hear I'm "good for the K" then rely on their 1NC generic tags alone and it puts me in an awkward position.
Argument Type: I come from the "academic left" part of the community and was trained by and inspired by people in that tradition. My top performing team right now reads a non-topical affirmative and usually utilizes a 1-off strat. I've judged a few identity based argument styles but do not consider myself an expert in that arena by any means (I'm just now getting into Wilderson and Yancy). I'm not the best critic for policymaking debate but do my best to adapt. Mike Davis often repeats that debate should be for the debaters - I agree.
Offense/Defense: Maybe it's just my self-perception, but I think I tend to be more friendly to defensive arguments than most critics.
Persuasion: I'm sure that your evidence is on fire. Maybe that just means you have an army of card cutters. Pathos and Ethos have weight, just like Logos.
Speaker Points: I've been persuaded that the .1 scale is better (or at least in use). As such, I've been told that maintaining a 27.5 floor and ~29.0 ceiling is appropriate.
