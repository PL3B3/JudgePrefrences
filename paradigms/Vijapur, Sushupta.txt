  I am an new Lincoln Douglas judge. I competed in Public Forum Debate all throughout my high school career. Therefore, I am familiar with how debate works but I am not completely comfortable with Lincoln Douglas debate. 

I prefer if the competitors speak at a reasonable speed while giving their speeches but, I do understand that speed is an important aspect to LD debates. However, I will not vote on arguments I did not catch the first time around. 

As a judge I will pay close attention to rebuttals and cross examinations in order to make my decision of the winner. These are the areas where I will look for the competitors to convince me of their arguments. I will reward clearly researched, well thought-out and insightful arguments. 

Overall, be courteous and persuasive throughout the round and convince me to vote in your favor.
