Judging Philosophy

This is my 9th year coaching and my 6th year coaching CX.

In general I will vote on anything if you make a good case for it! If your taglines are not clear and slow enough for me to flow, I won't be able to flow them. If I can't flow it, I can't vote on it. I like to see clash within a debate and I LOVE voting issues. I want you to frame the debate, tell me what the important parts are, refute the points your opponent brings up and tell me why you've won. :-)
