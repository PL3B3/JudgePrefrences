        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        framework, DA, CP, T debates are all pretty awesome!

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        are organized, clear, and effective. 

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        said anything incredibly insulting or rude, didn't stick to their road maps, not organized, gives underviews 

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        Politics DA

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        RVI's, that's about it. 

    
    
        Rate the following argument types

        Topicality: Awesome
Theory: Alright
Counterplans: Awesome
Disads: Awesome
Kritiks: Don't care
Framework: Awesome
Speed/Spreading: Awesome

    
    
        Explain your ratings, if you like

        

    
    
        Comments on flowing or speed:

        Speed is fine! I will flow everything. 

    
    
        Other things a team should know about?

        I love policy debate. I am not well versed with Kritiks, but if you can clearly explain your alternative and link story, and do a good job debating the K, I'll definitely vote for you.
