  I debated for four years at Valley High School. During this time I ran both policy and kritikal arguments. I have no preference regarding these arguments, other then to say that impact comparison is important. I would much rather evaluate a kritik debate that comes down to turns case arguments or impact arguments, then it be about the meta philosophy of the kritik.

Speed is fine, but clarity is important.

Also I don't really care about presentation, as long as the arguments you are making are good.

Also I don't have any biases about theory, though I tend to think that multiple conditional worlds are probably bad.
