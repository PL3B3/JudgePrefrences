  I have been judging policy and LD for the last five or six years as a result of my sons participating in high school and college policy debate. 
I’m OK with all types of arguments. However, I expect that debaters fully understand and can clearly explain their arguments and their positions. I will vote T if appropriate and well presented and supported.  Speed is fine but it must be clear. I can’t flow what I can’t understand. And since I generally vote based on my flow, some roadmapping is useful. No matter what the speed, I still look for some pause between tags and citations and the text. I also expect that at some time during the final speeches, the reasons why I should vote for aff or neg position are clearly laid out. 
As for speaks, I look for clear and clever. I give high speaks for good analysis presented in a well-organized fashion. I also reward good CX.
