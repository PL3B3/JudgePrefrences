JUDGING PHILOSOPHY
 
CX
 Rounds judged: 40+
Judging approach: tabula rasa
Policy priority: equal
Evidence philosophy: quality
Paradigm: I approach the round as a blank slate and try to let the debaters sway me in one direction or another. Whoever presents the best arguments and policies will win the round. Communication is also important and can be a tie breaker.
LD
 Rounds judged: 60+
Approach: Equal
Philosophy: The debater must tell me how their value and criteria link and why it should be held to a higher value. I look for drops and gaps in the debatersâ€™ arguments. Communication is also important and can be a tie breaker.
