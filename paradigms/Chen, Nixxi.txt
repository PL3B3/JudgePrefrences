  The following paradigm is partially adopted from fellow ex-debater Matt Dunay but all views are my own.

I debated for three years at the Bronx High School of from ‘05-’08. 
You can literally argue whatever you want in round as long as it is constructed well and genuinely persuasive. This doesn't mean you have to speak slowly or eloquently but it does mean you have to make logically coherent and smart arguments. Strategy, technical proficiency, and speaking skills go into this calculation. As a caveat, I'm not up to date on any jargon/debate strategies that may or not may be en vogue.

Five notes. First, speed is not an issue, but clarity can be. If I have no idea what your saying it will be obvious as I will stop flowing. I will not yell clear because that is a form of intervention in my mind. Second, I apparently am a stickler for substantive argument comparison and weighing. If your opponent does this and you don't (or neither of you do) you probably will not like the decision. Third, extensions need to be warranted thoroughly. Fourth, pretend I am an idiot when you make complicated arguments and go out of your way to explain them. Debaters tend to think they are a lot clearer than they actually are, and I can only vote for what I understand. Fifth, I will only call evidence after the round if there is an in round dispute over the words or meaning of the cards.

Be smart and have fun.
