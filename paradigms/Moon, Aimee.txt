Judging Philosophy:

Generally, I'm a policy maker judge. I want lots of impact analysis; tell me why I should prefer your impact scenario using timeframe, magnitude, blah blah blah. However, I also love the stock issues, specifically solvency. I believe that a strong policy team should be able to make logical arguments on case, not just spit out canned shells the entire duration of their speech. Don't get me wrong, I like off case too, but I will like you more if you can do some arguments on solvency or advantages in addition to your off case arguments.

I'm usually fine with speed as long as I can flow your taglines and you give your opponents ample opportunity to view case.

I'll listen to any issues presented in the debate as long as they're explained well and impacted out. However, if you want me to vote on something, you had better present it as a voter and carry it throughout the entire round.

If you're mean to each other, I will not like you, which means I'll try to find reasons to vote you down. So, basically, keep the debate clean and friendly. We'll all have more fun that way.

Oh, and if you can make me laugh I'll like you more! :)
