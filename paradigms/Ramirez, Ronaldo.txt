  Background: I debated for 4 years in high school, 2 years policy and LD each.

Overall: Pretty tab. Don't care what you run, an argument is an argument. If you're impacting, extending, and having proper clash, you should be fine. Besides that, you can probably get away with more in front of me than with other judges. For example, if you give me a good reason why K's come before theory I'm cool with that, as long as you don't go new in the 2 or something.

Framework: I enjoy a clean framework debate. There's nothing particular about how I judge framework that comes to mind. If I think neither debater is giving me a clear framework that I can use to eval the round, I'll default util.

Speed: I should be fine with most speed. However, if you're reading important statistics or some dense philosophy, slow down. If there's an issue with speed I'll just tell you to slow down in the round.

Speaks: I award speaks based on how well I think you debated and how eloquent you were. If you make me intervene or do work for you, it'll probably hurt your speaks.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me in round.
