  Both debaters must defend and maintain their value/framework throughout the debate. The better debater will be able to clearly state and prove that their resolution is more valid or should be viewed as a general principle while upholding their value. During the debate, opposing frameworks should be disputed and arguably proven to be inadequate, flawed, or false. Information presented as fact or proof must directly relate to first principles (self-evident truths) or objective facts that originate from a reliable source (documentation or sourcing will be required). 

Debaters should stay focused and opt to debate the issue/values at hand; trying to win a debate by debating the rules and regulations of the debate is a moot point. 
Spreading (i.e. speaking faster in an attempt to outpace the competitors ability to respond) can be counter-productive and is discouraged. The purpose of a debate is to prove yourself as a better debater, not a faster talker. 

During cross examination, a little clash is normal and sometimes necessary. Ask questions that are to the point and have a purpose; you are not judging whether or not your opponent can read between the lines or fall for an overgeneralized question. Be courteous. Do not make it personal or insult your opponentâ€™s intelligence or speaking abilities. 

Debaters will also be able to convince their target audience that they are a clear winner by stating strong voting points and are able to explain HOW they won. 
Speaker points are rewarded based on delivery (e.g. clear, comprehensible, expressive, good word choice, and persuasive) and etiquette (e.g. appropriate body-language, eye contact, posture, and professional conduct).
