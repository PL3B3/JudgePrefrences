  I have judged for more than 13 years, but took a break for a few years and am back at it. I coached forensics and policy debate in Houston and Dallas for around seven years while competing in NDT and CEDA, then full time for few years. I was a policy debater in high school before that. I prefer solid case debate to generics, but I don't require a case debate and I enjoy good critical discussions and counterplans. I guess that makes me a flow judge, but I still prefer closed CX and a good effort to communicate, analyze, etc. For more check my paradigm on Tabroom.com.
