  I debated LD for four years for Lake Highland Prep, whom I now coach. I debated extensively on the local Florida circuit and the national circuit. I qualified to the TOC my senior year. I now attend Indiana University.

Paradigm: I will vote on pretty much any argument as long as it is warranted and extended properly. You can ask me about my defaults before the round, but keep in mind that any of my defaults can be changed easily if arguments are made for why they should be. I believe that debate is a strategic game and that you should play that game however you like. I am probably weakest in evaluating overly complicated counterplans and pre-fiat k debates. This is not to say that I will not evaluate these positions to the best of my ability, but I just wanted to warn you. Slowing down when reading important warrants and tags is the best way to help me understand these types of arguments. 
I think that the most miserable thing about debate was when kids would take rounds too seriously and not have any fun. Debate is a blast- have fun, make jokes, and definitely don’t take things too seriously. I promise that you will have way more fun this way and your judges will recognize this and reward you with higher speaks. 
Please ask me more specific questions before the round if this doesn’t sufficiently answer your questions. 

My defaults (the following is copy and pasted from Sam Azbel’s paradigm lol): 
Theory Stuff:

- I like theory and T a lot, and I feel I can evaluate these debates really well
-the "must" plank in Offensive Counter interps needs to be justified

- I default to text of the interp

- I default to competing interps

- paragraph theory is cool

- Reading theory for solely strategic purposes is fine

- I don't think that I meets trigger an RVI unless told so
- I believe that meta theory doesn’t necessarily come before regular theory and that you can weigh between standards. However, this can be changed easily by making “meta theory comes first” arguments.

Speaker points: I will average a 28.5 and adjust them based on the quality of the pool in the tournament

Random things:

- Slow down on tags, plan text, theory interps, etc.

- Being funny = happy judge

- don't be mean
