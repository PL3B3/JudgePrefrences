  I was an LD debater for Northland Christian both locally and nationally for 4 years, and also participated in FX throughout high school. Even though I don't coach for any teams, I try and keep active in the debate community by teaching at camps such as GDS, and judging as often as I can during the school year.
As a debater, I favored policy-esque arguments (plans, DAs, etc), and as such, I prefer listening to these type of arguments. This doesn't mean I won't listen to other case positions, however, and I'm willing to watch anything from a round with stock positions to K's. When it comes to kritiks, I would really appreciate it if the position was clearly explained (especially in terms of ROB/ROJ, the layer of the debate it functions on, and pre/post fiat) and cleanly extended throughout the round, since I may not be as familiar with the rhetoric and literature presented. I won't vote on any argument that tries to justify unjustifiable things (the Holocaust, slavery, other forms of oppression).
I have a high threshold for theory unless clear abuse has already occurred in the round. I know my definition of that is different than others, so feel free to ask for clarification before the round. I'm pretty open to T arguments.
You'll get high speaker points if you speak clearly, extend arguments, and weigh, and you'll get low speaker points if you're rude and/or offensive to anyone in the room (I listen to CX, too, so be civil during that), or if you speak particularly unclearly. You can read as fast as you want, just be clear. I'll ask you to be clearer a few times, but eventually I'll just have to try my best with guessing if you don't listen, and that isn't good for anyone.
Feel free to ask for clarification on any of these points before the round, or ask any more questions that you think could apply to the debate. Thanks for reading this :)
