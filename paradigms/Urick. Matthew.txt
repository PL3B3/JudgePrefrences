  1. Tabula rasa: I accept all logical contentions presented regardless of form.
2. Speed: I do not accept spreading in any form of debate. The first person to spread has a 95% chance of being voted down. Speed in CX must be clear and well below conventionally accept spreading speeds. Speed in LD must be extremely clear and only slightly above conversation speeds.
3. Debate is an educational activity which includes more than just the ability to structure and respond to logical argument. Speeches should be best attempts at conventional rhetorical practices seen when experts in particular fields are speaking to lay people in the cases of LD and PF, and experts in CX.
