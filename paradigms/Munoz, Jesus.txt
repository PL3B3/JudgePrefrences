Debate background:

I debated on the University of Utah's parli team for two years. 

Vision of debate:

Every debater has different reasons for participating in this activity. Whether you use debate as a catalyst for your intellectual exploration, as a space to voice your opinion, as a means to gain access to higher education and/or simply as an activity to make friends and family in- I believe that each and every debater has a right to use the material resources provided by this activity in anyway they feel the need to. That being said, my general understanding in debate rounds is (unless otherwise specified in round): There are no "rules", just competing interpretations. Make the arguments you want to make and be prepared to engage and answer offense clearly.

Blurbs:

- I like performance arguments, criticisms, and creative theory shells.

Update- If you want me to be a good judge donâ€™t read theory pls

- Please hard-point in all your speeches. It makes my life so much easier.

- I won't drop you "instantaneously," per se, if you're unreasonably aggressive, rude or intransigently exclusionary to the other debater.. but I WILL dock you serious speaker points and will be VERY receptive to any offense generated by the other debater that is predicated on your questionable behavior.

End note:

Odds are I didn't provide answers to more specific questions you may be interested in (perm theory, condo, cp stuff, argument thresholds) Feel free to ask these before our round starts, or, here's my e-mail: u0680473@live.com; feel free to contact me if you have any specific inquiry whose response is not already implied or provided by this philosophy.
