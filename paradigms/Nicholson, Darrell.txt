  I've judged at Yale Invitational 2017, and Dixie Holland 2017. I've judged Extemp, DI, and HI. I look for great eye contact, persuasive speech that doesn't come across as contrived and phony. I'm a journalist, so I'll know write away if your sources are bogus. If you have good fluency and are truly passionate about the topic you are presenting, you well get my vote. I am a trained actor, so authentic gesturing is also important. Basically, your presentation should be real, fluent, and well-researched.
