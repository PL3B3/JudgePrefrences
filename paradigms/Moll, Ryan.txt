  Im Ryan, I am not necessarily extremely familiar with judging debate, but I did Model U.N. all throughout high school and went to state doing it. Im also very aware of current world events and international relations. Please don't be overtly rude in rounds and make sure to impact your arguments and tell me why they matter. Try to roadmap the best you can, and make sure you are clear in your argumentation. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me in round! Good Luck.
