  I graduated from Randolph High School in 2014, and I rarely judge.

General Things
I’m a bit rusty on speed. If you need to spread, please be very clear and avoid warp speed or I’ll ask you to slow down. If I can’t understand an argument, I can’t flow it.I would recommend telling me the voting issues in your last speech. You don’t have to explicitly say “here are the voting issues” and number them off for me, but at least give me a breakdown of why you win. Make my job easier, judging blows.I hear that K’s are all the rage these days? I rarely debated the K so it may not be in your best interest to run one in front of me. If you have to, go slow and explain it really well. Same goes for disads and topicality arguments.WEIGH. Seriously, please weigh, I refuse to do it for you. I would hate to pass over a great string of arguments because neither debater weighed.Theory is fine, especially when it is clearly necessary.
How I Determine Speaker Points:
I love creative arguments. I know you have files and folders of cases and theory shells and topic lit, but if you run arguments that I haven’t been hearing all day long I will boost your speaks.Don’t be an asshole.If you don’t need to use up all of your speech time, please just sit down. If you start rambling to fill time I may give you a dirty look by accident. I apologize ahead of time, I can’t help bitch face.Make jokes.Did I mention not to be an asshole?I won’t say no to coffee/water/food. Providing sustenance is the only value criterion I really care about. Seriously though if you bring me food.
IMPORTANT: I am rusty, so if there’s some hip new trend that you’re thinking of running that I may be unaware of, please ask before the round if I am comfortable with it. I can’t vote on what I don’t understand, and I want to give you guys the most fair judgement that I can.
