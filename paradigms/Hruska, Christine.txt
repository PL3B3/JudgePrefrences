4 Years of Debate at Shawnee Mission West
Speaker Positions: 1A/2N
Currently an Assistant Debate Coach at SMW
Rounds Judged on this topic: probably around 5
My knowledge of this topic is somewhat limited, so don’t throw around ocean jargon.
I would say I am a policy maker judge.

Case: I really love when people talk about case and make case arguments, turns, etc. I think case arguments are very underutilized in debate.

Disads: Disads are good too. I read a lot of them in high school. Generic disads are fine, as long as you at least try to find a specific-ish link. To be completely honest though, I’m not a fan of politics. Obviously you can read it if you want, just know that I wouldn’t be jumping up and down to hear it.

Counterplans: I never ran counterplans really when I debated, and therefore I don’t remember all the intricacies of the arguments involved. Again, you can obviously run counterplans, but me sure to explain it really well and probably slow down on theory arguments.

Kritiks: I’m okay with kritiks (if you explain them well). I ran K’s more often than I ran CP’s in high school, if that means anything to you.

Mostly I want you to explain things to me and be smart. I really like super responsive, line-by-line debates (seriously, I love line-by-line) and I will definitely enjoy the round more if it’s responsive. You can talk fast if you want, but also keep in mind I haven’t been a debater for three years and haven’t watched too many rounds on this topic.
