  LD judge since 1991. Judged out rounds at NFL Nationals multiple times. Congress coach and co-debate coach at Butte Falls High School, Butte Falls, Oregon. Coach all levels of LD and PF. In LD I want to see clash between the two teams. I want to see the value and criterion support the case. Analysis and research are considered as equally important. I do not like excessive speed. I look for well constructed cases and well developed arguments. Ultimately, the debaters are in charge of the round, so they need to steer the debate.
