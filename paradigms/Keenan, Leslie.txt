I am the parent of a debater who has done LD for the past 3 years. I've judged a number of tournaments over the past year, that said - don't spread, be clear, I won't understand you if you rush through your case. I will do my best to evaluate the round solely on the flow and I won't make decisions based on how you were speaking, so don't worry about not making enough eye contact and getting dropped for it, but make sure you're very clear about the functionality of your arguments, explain what arguments you're winning on, why these mean you win, and why they're more important than the reasons your opponent says he or she is winning.
