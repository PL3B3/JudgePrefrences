  Debate Coach at Plano West Senior High School (TX)
Policy Debate at Columbia University/ The New School University
Debated at Decatur HS (TX)

I will default policy maker unless I am given another framework to use.

Early in my career I was a notably conservative judge that had a strong bias against ‘nontraditional debate.’ I have since changed my views on this and enjoy seeing where the activity can be taken through performance/nontraditional debate. I have made an effort to familiarize myself with K’s and the literature associated with them. That being said, I am still learning, and I will potentially need a little more explanation in order to vote for these types of arguments. 

Delivery: I don’t have any specific speaking style I prefer over another. As far as speed is concerned, I would say I don’t do well with it. I can handle some speed, but that is subjective. For clarification, don’t do anything faster than a 1990’s rap song. I enjoy seeing the evidence explained and discussed. For maximum speaker points, don’t spend all your time reading. Instead, talk to me. Please be respectful.


Please feel free to ask me any specific questions you may have before the round.
