Arguments- Please be clear and organized; state your value and value criterion, and then work to prove them in your debate. Don't forget about them and start arguing just your contentions. Make sure to uphold your value. Also, make sure to follow through on your arguments. Don't just say something is true / valid because it "is." Make sure to prove or explain it.

Delivery- Speak at a NORMAL pace. I do not care for speed and dislike when competitors use it to intimidate and or squeeze points in. If I can't understand you, I can't judge you. If I can't judge you, you can't score well. Remember, you've worked hard to build your arguments. Everyone should be able to hear and understand your words.

Decorum- Be nice. There is nothing more frustrating than arrogance or rudeness. It has no place in debate, and if you were trying to get your points across in the "real world" you'd be required to be professional- at least if you wanted a great majority of people to listen to you for an extended period of time. Don't be rude to your competitor, and certainly not to your judge.
