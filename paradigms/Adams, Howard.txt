  I'm a coach to a traditional team in central California,but i appreciate debate of all types.
I'm mostly an LD judge, I almost never judge policy but when i do my preference are pretty much the same as LD. I just wants good smart arguments with good links, if you have an impact, state it. Don't elude to it. I'll vote off of almost anything (including offcase) it you convince me it is true. I love good cross.
Be careful with speed, i'm okay with with you going quickly if you're clear, but i sometimes cannot understand spreading. So spew at your own risk.
Make sure you explain any complex literature in depth.
Things to avoid:
-Don't be mean to another competitors (in or out of round)
-Don't tell me how to vote, persuade me to vote for aff/neg rather than stating "you must vote neg"

Any further questions feel free to ask me in round.
