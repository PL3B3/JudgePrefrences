  Background:
In high school I did LD all four years. I have experience on a local, regional, state and national level.

Judging Style:
I will listen to and judge the round based on any argument provided to me. Note, however, that it is the burden of the debaters to set a clear criterion/ clear criteria as to how they want their arguments to be weighed. Don't expect me to flow cx as an argument. Make sure that your arguments have a claim and a warrant; if you want to cross apply something don't assume that the argument works the same way- elaborate. I look to the Value/ Value Criterion as a paramount issue in the debate, but if both debaters choose to focus more on something else i will turn to the V/VC as a last resort for judging purposes.

Preferences:
I know many of you have your hearts set on spreading; I don't mind it nor do I prefer it. But- if the argument is crucial I suggest that you take the time to speak clearly and concisely on it. Keep the debate clean- just don't be a jerk. Aside from that, any other debating style is open for use.
