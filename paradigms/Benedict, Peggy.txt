Judging Philosophy-
I want clear and well-supported arguments presented in a logical and intelligent manner. Clear communication is preferred, although some speed is acceptable.
In LD Debate, clash is important and I will core value and criterion arguments as important, but also evaluate substantive issues in the round. Signposting is important and rebuttals should help to crystallize the debate. Line by Line by argumentation is effective, but the bigger picture must also be examined.
