Things to Know...

I debate throughout high school and my first year + in college. I am currently employed as an Engineer at a Medical Device company. I am judging debate because I truly believe that this activity provides a unique skill set and should be supported.

Win your argument and impact that argument you win the round; I really donâ€™t care what that argument is. I say that with a caveat; I have a distinct displeasure for theory debates, consider really hard before you go for this in front of me, I will, in exceedingly rare instances vote on theory (if it dropped or amazing, as in Hope diamond amazing).

Comparative risk analysis is highly encouraged by this I mean take your impact assessment to the next level and frame it in context of risk of links or turns or whatever. It is rare that you are truly winning 100% of anything and doing a little CYA will go a long way in front of me.

Random:

Tell me how to vote and I will attempt to abide (framework etc).
Prioritize arguments for me and I will evaluate accordingly.
Explain the warrants of the evidence you are extending not just the tag and the site.
Alternatives to Kritiks should NOT be treated like a counterplan, period.
I value logical, well reasoned arguments even if you don't have the evidence if it makes contextual sense.
I truly appreciate strategic decisions, connect the dots between the arguments and take risks in the rounds.

Final statement: Treat each other with respect; I will dock your speaker points if you are inappropriate.
