  I was a coach at La Crosse Central High School for many years. I retired last year and have had countless experiences judging.
Paradigm: Tabs--have a good debate and convince me why I should vote for your team
Kritiks, Counterplans, DAs: All OK with me. Creativity is a plus!!!
Negs are free to split the neg block, if they choose. Negs can bring up new arguments in the 2NC.
Please do not speed read excessively. I'd rather have you be slower and clearer than faster and mumbling. It's hard to judge teams that I can't understand.
I am Ok with open Cross-x but do not abuse it.

Again, my paradigm really sums up what I'm looking for in a good debate...A GOOD DEBATE!!! The team that presents the best arguments and can successfully convince me of why they should win will. Good luck! I look forward to a good tournament!
