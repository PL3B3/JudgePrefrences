  Personal Background: 

I am currently a sophomore at Harvard. I debated at Stuyvesant High School for four years and on the Harvard team last year. 

Important things to note:

1) I am not very familiar with this year's topic, so please be careful on Topicality debates and dont think that I understand all your acronyms. 

2) I highly value explanation, comparison, and argument resolution. I don't believe that just because you extend an argument that the other team dropped, you should win the round- there is still a burden on you to explain why that argument wins you the round and outweighs any arguments your opponents might win. Similarly, just because your cards are good, doesn't mean you win the argument- what is more important is your spin on the evidence and how you use it in the debate.
