For prefs
I debated LD for Walt Whitman High School (conflict) for four years on the local and national circuit.
Third year out, tech, old school fwamework debate > everything else, not the best at evaluating very very close theory rounds, but a 1 in terms of openness (frivolous theory included)


Style
I have a relatively high threshold for warrants and extensions. 
It’s your job to make sure I understand the warrants to your arguments the first time you present them. 
I’ll say clear/slow as many times as is necessary.
I’ll vote on anything you win on the flow.
I didn’t make a lot of critical arguments when I debated so provide a very clear story if you plan to.
I have no default preferences for theory: justify how the debate should be framed and I will buy it.

Speaks
Be rude at the risk of very bad speaks.
For good speaks: smart strategy, and crucially, clear and compelling weighing. 
If it becomes clear your opponent is struggling to understand your argument, make an earnest effort to explain it simply--rhetorical hand-waving will just show me that you don't truly understand the argument.

Tech vs. lay rounds
Tech: This is a test of your ability to simply and elegantly explain tech arguments that are often made inaccessible by a lot of jargon. Get good speaks by making this a good (and educational) use of everyone’s time.
Lay: Get good speaker points by demonstrating a good command of language and making clever arguments which demonstrate an accurate understanding of how your arguments interact with your opponent's arguments.
