  as a default, i weigh on net benefits--i'm not a fan of stock issues. but whatevs, warranted arguments win the rounds, so if you want me to weigh on something else ("liberation of people" or something wack like that), go for it.

CP--i enjoy creative cp debates, so it's not an issue for me in LD.

K--i'm an avid fan of the K debate, but the internals need to be solid, and don't bother running it w/o and alternative. Give me clear links, and a clear framework.

T--i have a high threshold for T; i need to see impact analysis on the standards debate, and a weighing of the standard debate so as to compel and interaction, not just an extension of dropped arguments. i buy any abuse/epistemic voting story; it's all up for debate in round. i don't mind high-tech theory rounds, just don't rely on tags alone.

history--i debate on the npda circuit for univiersity of the pacific.
