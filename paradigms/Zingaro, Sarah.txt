  My judging philosophy is simple:

I do not appreciate spreading. Please do your best to keep it around a conversational speed. If I can't follow or understand what you are saying then you will not pick up my ballotI'm not a fan of jargon, as it detracts from the ability for people not well versed in the activity to followYou can be assertive without being aggressive. Do not make the environment hostile for the other side. If you need to be mean to win a debate, you're doing something wrongKnow your argument. Be passionate. Be clear.
