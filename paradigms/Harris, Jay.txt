  Stock issues judge. Be organized, road maps,etc. You can speak quickly as long as it is clear. Each round make sure to reaffirm your plan & attack the weaknesses of your opponents. Do not assume I know them if they are not brought up again. Be respectful to all.
Counterplans are great. I am looking for the best solution to the problem. Solvency is the key for me when it comes to voting. If both sides come up with plausible plans I will decide on who has the best ads/disads. Stay focused- Be clear- Stay on Topic- Give me the best solution and you will get my vote. Experience- 4 years of judging CX, LD & some PFD.
