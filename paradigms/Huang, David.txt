gist:
- three years removed from the debate circuit
- i study computer science and philosophy at the university of chicago
- speed ok, be clear
- no preference on argumentative choices, i.e. go with what you're good at
- do not presume that i have read what you have or think what you think or know what you know, regardless of what you're talking about - explanation and warrant with every claim 
- uhhh
- be nice or something and stuff like that :)
- no prep for flashing speeches unless you're obnoxious about it
