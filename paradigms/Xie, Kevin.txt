Personal Info
I debated at Lexington, and attended the TOC my junior and senior year. I was a 2A throughout my debate career. I don't debate in college.

General Thoughts
my role as a judge is to decide between two courses of action - whether they be policies, critical affirmations, or anything elsei am more experienced with plan-based debate. However, I am open to all forms and styles of argumentation and will adjudicate different debates to the best of my ability.i judged some camp debates at the DDI on the surveillance topichowever, i do not have much familiarity with the topic - you should explain highly technical/specific conceptsthe main thing which guides the way I view/think about debates is specificity – the more well-tailored your arguments are to the particular debate, the better. In-depth research and preparation will be rewarded by better points and a higher chance of victory. This also applies to how you apply your arguments in the context of your opponents’.tech over truth, although I think the best debates involve some degree of reality.high quality evidence is important to me. Research was one of my favorite things about debate, so I have great appreciation for quality research and disdain for terrible research.that being said, you do not need evidence to make arguments; intelligent analytic presses can be very effective against weak/illogical claims.there is such thing as zero risk of an argument.
Specific Arguments
Many of these preferences can be overridden based on what is said in the debate.

Topicality –
should be about competing interpretations, and it would be hard to persuade me otherwisestrong, well-researched definitions, clearly explained impacts, and caselists are important to megeneric topicality and specification arguments are very unpersuasive to me
Framework/”Non-traditional” Affirmatives –
you don't need to defend a topical plan, but you should defend a positive action related to the topicframework is a relevant response to affirmatives that do not defend a plan, in my opinionthat being said, I think a lot of framework debates lack specific impacts and contextualization and the aff can easily benefit from thatnon-framework strategies are potentially more strategic and also interesting to adjudicateon the aff, I find arguments about the importance of your education/discussion/skills the most persuasivei'm undecided on the question of perms vs alternate methods - I lean towards the aff not getting perms - I find theoretical neg arguments about opportunity cost fairly intuitiveregardless of argument, both sides should stake their ground and defend it - being shifty will only put you in a worse spot
Critiques –
I'm mostly familiar with IR-related and Marxist authorship, as well as some neoliberalism literaturewhile I have some basic understanding of most authors/arguments, the more explanation the betterif I don't understand what you're talking about, there is no chance I am voting for youyou should contextualize your criticism to the aff and make specific link arguments - otherwise you are very vulnerable to the permthe aff should use the case more vs most Kstraditional K "tricks" are not very persuasive to me - while the aff has to answer them, a short response will suffice (assuming it's a relevant and coherent response) - you are better off trying to win the thesis of your criticism
Counterplans –
not a fan of generic process counterplans; I lean aff pretty heavily for the associated theory/competition questionsthey, like most other arguments, can be made more palatable with specific solvency advocatesmost other counterplans are fine; pretty ambivalent about international fiat, states, etc.my default is that presumption goes to whoever proposes less change, but that is up for debatenot a huge fan of judge-kick - I will only get rid of the CP for you if you explicitly say I can + win the conditionality debate
Disads –
are great. I went for the politics disad a lot, but topic DAs are more enjoyable to debate and judgeI think that the link controls the direction of uniqueness, but you better win at least some risk of all componentscontrolling the impact debate and turns case debate is extremely important
Theory –
in-depth theory debates are good; fast, blippy theory debates are badall else equal, I'd prefer to hear a substantive debate - but if it's your best/only option for victory then obviously go for it. If you go for it well, that's also cool.for conditionality, 2 options is probably the limit - I am very sympathetic towards the aff after that pointdefault is reject the argument, not the team - except for conditionality
Speaker Points –
I’ll adhere to the tournament guidelines, if they exist. Otherwise I’ll start at a 27.5 average.clarity is important - I'll say clear twice and then only flow what I can understand after that. It'll also affect your points.cross-ex was also one of my favorite parts of debate - I will attempt to "flow" parts of cross-ex, and will reward effective cross-examinations with higher pointsplease be respectful – some aggressiveness is fine but there’s a fine line between that and just being unpleasant
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. 
Good luck and have fun!
