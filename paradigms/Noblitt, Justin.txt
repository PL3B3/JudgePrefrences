Overview: Policy maker; Don't go too fast, don't be rude to your opponent, don't make ridiculous arguments.

Speed: I'm fine with anything that I can follow, but if you start spreading I can't guarantee that I'll be able to follow you. If you DO start to go too fast, I'll shout 'Clear' once, beyond that I'll just start knocking off speaker points and stop flowing.

Topicality: I like a good T debate as much as the next guy, but if you present three topicalities on a case that's clearly topical there's almost no chance that I'll vote on them, I'll also be much more inclined to vote an RVI than I would be otherwise.

Disadvantages: Please provide an impact calculus that compares directly to the affirmative, it makes things easier to weigh.

Counterplans: Please no consult CP's, everything else I'm cool with.

Kritiks: There's a fine line between a nice, educational K, and an abusive K. Basically, if you're using K to get out of debating with the aff, I'm not going to vote on it.

Performance: Please don't do these.

Miscellaneous Points: Don't be racist or sexist in your speeches or CX, it just makes you look juvenile. Don't be rude to your opponents for the same reason. Give roadmaps. Have fun.
