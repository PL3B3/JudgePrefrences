  From Minnesota. Debate resume includes PF, Classic, and LD in high-school, in addition to extemp speaking. I currently debate for Yale on the parli team.

I vote on anything that is clearly explained/impacted, appropriately weighed against the other RFDs in the round and that has some basis in reality.

Arguments - Don't rely on cards to do all the argumentation for you. I appreciate independent thought, analysis and common-sense responses to evidence from your opponents that screams BS.

Speed - I'm not cool with policy-esque speeds but I will put up with anything short of that.

Kritiks - Not my favorite but I don't mind if they're done well.

Rebuttals- Weighing arguments is really really really important. Even if you are losing every argument on the flow save for one, if you manage to convince me that the one thing you are winning is more important than everything else I will pick you up high.
