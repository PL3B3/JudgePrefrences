  I debated for four years at Whitney Young Magnet in Chicago, and I currently coach Evanston Township High School in Illinois.

I'm very well acquainted with national circuit debate, so you don't need to have any concerns about speed or jargon or anything like that. That said, I think I'm like most other judges in that I find it annoying when debaters try to go faster than they can while maintaining reasonable pitch and clarity. I'll shout "clear" if it gets too bad.

I find it extremely frustrating when debaters run the K poorly, so if you're going to go for a K in front of me make sure you're able to explain it. I will give the aff a lot of leeway on alt solvency indicts and framework if you're not able to defend those things well.

I also don't like reading evidence. I will if I think that there's a specific dispute over what a piece of evidence says, but I think that it's the debaters' job to explain warrants well in the debate. If they're not in the debate, I don't think it's fair for me to extend them through the debate for you, because the other team couldn't have predicted that.

If you don't have paper copies of your evidence, you need to flash your opponents your evidence before your speech and provide a viewing computer in the event that they do not have laptops with them. This is a matter of fairness and community inclusion of schools and debaters with fewer resources. If you are unable to share your evidence in this manner with your opponents, I will dock you 5 speaker points.

If you have any other specific questions, ask before the round. If I think of anything else to add I'll add it later.

Good luck! :)
