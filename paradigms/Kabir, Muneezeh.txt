  I am actually the IE assistant coach at Dulles High School (TX), but occasionally I will be helping out with LD obligations. I was a competitive interper for 4 years at Clements High School (TX) but I have seen a fair share of Houston, Texas, and TOC styles of LD in the last 4+ years. (And, to be helpful, I have practiced flowing speed and have been educated on the technical aspects of LD.)

I think that a debate round should be clear both in terms of what is being said and how it is being said. I'd like to think that I can flow decently, but if you're going far too quickly I'll yell "clear" or give some sort of signal so you have an opportunity to slow down. I'm okay with speed, I just ask that you be comprehensible and signpost.

Quite simply, I will vote off of what you tell me to vote for. You should make it very easy for me to sign the ballot--I shouldn't have to be doing the work for you.

In terms of unorthodox case positions, theory, and the like, there should be solid justification if I'm going to vote in your favor. At its core, I think a round is trying to determine whether the resolution is true or false, but I'm not opposed to the atypical.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask before the round.
