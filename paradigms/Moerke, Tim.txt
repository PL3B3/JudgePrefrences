  I did not debate in high school, but my wife and brother both did. I have been judging debate for awhile now, over 7 years. I prefer a value style debate because that is what Lincoln Douglas was intended to be. I am pretty ok with the new strategies of debate, but if you do decide to use theories or critiques, please do so with a purpose. Above all, in every facet of your debating, you should be explaining yourself, warranting and impacting your arguments, and making it clear why I should vote for you. I am fine with speed, just let me know before the round begins. However, I do not believe the best debaters are the fastest. For me, the best debaters are ones that have perfected thinking critically and using knowledge of the topic to win the round. Ask me any other questions before the round. I look forward to seeing you there.
