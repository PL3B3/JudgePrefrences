  Debater for Binghamton University.

T: Voting issue; not an RVI. I don't know this year's topic, so you're going to have to actually explain this to me.

Speed: Please just slow down on the tag/author/year and enunciate. I beg of you. I'd rather you read five taglines I can understand than 45 you mumble through.

Theory: Sure, fine, whatever. Just explain to me why I should vote on it. If the other team drops an argument, and all you do is point out that they dropped it, that's probably not sufficient reason for me to vote. Explain why it matters. (That goes for all dropped arguments, come to think of it..)

Ks: Yeah, go for it. I don't have a background in philosophy, so please actually explain these arguments.

Basically run whatever you want, explain your arguments, don't just extend tags and authors, weigh your impacts, tell me how I should evaluate the round. That's about it. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me before the round.

PS: I will give the highest speaker points to whoever yells loudest in cross-ex.
