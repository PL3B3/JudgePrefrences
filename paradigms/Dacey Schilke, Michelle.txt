  I have been coaching for 16 years and was a competitor before that. I do come from a speech background so to me, how you say it is important. I don't have a problem with speed, but if you are going to do it, do it for a reason.

"Do it for a reason" pretty much sums up my philosophy. I'm not big on generic anything, or time sucks or running something just for the sake of it. Every Aff case can not be a T violation. Don't waste time on arguments you know aren't going anywhere. I also own a dictionary so there is no need to debate definitions.

I don't mind off case stuff but they gave you a topic for a reason. Tie your arguments to the actual resolution/ case. I want to hear your own analysis and why it matters to this debate.

I also believe that all is fair in love, war and policy. Unless your opponent is beating you over the head with a laptop, it isn't abuse.
