  Speaking style is important. I want to hear logical arguments that apply to what both sides are saying. I prefer clash because making a decision on a round which is argued on two completely different levels will always leave one debater dissapointed with the decision. Preferably no spreading - quality over quantity! Don't make unfair burdens or I won't like you. Assume reciprocity with your burdens towards your opponent.
