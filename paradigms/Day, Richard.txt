Debated for 4 years in High School at Glenbrook South, now debate for Georgetown. The fact that I haven't judged a lot means you'll probably gain more from talking to others about how I think about debate than you will gain from my philosophy. 

Worked at institute this summer, haven't had a whole lot to do with the topic since then. I don't think this should be a huge problem for you, unless you're not explaining yourself on Topicality. I was a 2A in High School, and can be persuaded to vote aff on conditionality. 

I'm a sucker for politics and a strategic counterplan, or good case debate. Probably took politics in at least 90% of my neg rounds in HS. That doesn't mean that I can't be persuaded by thoughtful analytic link presses. 

The K - I can imagine a world where I'd vote for a carefully explained K against a poor set of aff answers. In any other case, you're either very brave, or must have absolutely nothing else to say. 

I will do my best to evaluate shitty arguments (Spec's, Process CP's, Spark, Wipeout, etc) fairly, but I will make sure to punish your speaker points.
