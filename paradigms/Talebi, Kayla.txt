  Debated LD in high school for 4 years and currently do policy debate at the University of Florida.

I try my best to be a very tabula rasa judge. That being said, I will weigh value structure higher in the round unless told otherwise during the debate. Try to explain your arguments rather than throw cards at the judge. Obviously, have evidence, but also be sure to demonstrate knowledge of what your evidence is saying and refer back to the evidence itself. I am familiar with Ks/Theory/etc. but prefer to not see them in LD (though I will judge it equally).

Speed: I'm not a fan of full-on spreading in LD debate, but I will judge it/can understand it. If you are spreading and I can't understand you, I will put my pen down.

Be sure to clearly extend arguments. Give me voting issues in your last speech. Essentially, you should write the RFD for me.
