  NOTE: since the wiki is supposedly going to be shut down, I have an updated version of my paradigm on tabroom at 
https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml?search_first=&search_last=bawany

I debated in high school in LD for 4 years at the local, state, and national circuit, and 2 years in PF. I'm currently doing policy debate at UT Dallas.

I'm fine with speed just please be clear.

I have no objections to stock, non-stock, topical, or untopical positions. I will evaluate every argument the same, I do not care about what arguments you make in front of me nor do I have any predispositions to a certain type of argument. Just tell me how to evaluate the round at the end and we'll be good.

Debate warrants, not tags.

Don't really care about T/Theory unless there's a clear violation that was dropped with good extensions or a long ass shell in LD about it

My RFDs are generally very blunt so don’t get offended, I’m only trying to make you a better debater.

I'll give you extra points for being funny.

If you have any questions, message me on Facebook or email me at aishabawany98@gmail.com
