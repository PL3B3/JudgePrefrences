  Harvard 2018 PF:
I graduated in 2017 from Timothy Christian School. I'm currently a freshman at Pace University in NYC studying Information Technology. I debated 2 years of LD and 2 years of PF in high school. I do not have any preference for argument type as long as they are good arguments. Quality>Quantity. I naturally have a higher threshold for evidence and want to see good evidence interaction in the round. Competing statistics can be hard to adjudicate, so the onus is on both teams to do evidence comparison so I have a mechanism for which competing "job loss or gains" or "price increases" statistics to buy in-round. Weighing is incredibly important since it is usually the determining factor in the debate. I pretty much always vote off the flow. If an argument is made in the summary, it needs to be made in the final focus for me to vote on it.

I am okay with evidence swaps and clarification before using prep time since it does take time to find your evidence and there is not very much prep time.

I will not give bad speaks if cross fire becomes heated. The only things that will affect your speaker points is your argument quality and if you are blatantly rude or insulting to your opponents.

PLEASE KEEP TRACK OF YOUR OWN PREP.
