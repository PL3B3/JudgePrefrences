  I have a semester of debate at Binghamton University. I have been to several tournaments and judged a high school tournament at Pennsbury. In rounds, as far as things are kept civilly, I don't mind. I want to know however, that people know about the arguments that they are running, not just reading cards. I like Kritiks, Dis/Ads and Counterplans. Theory arguments are where I place the least amount of emphasis for debate. I will only vote on Topicality if you are able to prove that it is untopical and that there is nothing else as the neg that you are able to run against them. This means that you should be going for T for the majority of the 2NR.
