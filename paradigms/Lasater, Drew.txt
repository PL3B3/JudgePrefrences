  As far as Policy Debate and progressive LD goes, I am essentially a lay judge. I do coach Public Forum, so I understand argumentation and know how to keep track of the major points of arguments. However, I cannot understand speed. Seriously, if you spread, I will not understand a word you say, even if you are the clearest speaker in the history of the world. NO SPEED -- please speak at a regular public speaking, clear communicative speed.
I want to hear arguments that make sense in regular, everyday terms. If the resolution is a policy resolution, keep your impacts to a reasonable limit and do your best to avoid the word "extinction" because it annoys me.
In LD, I am familiar with the value and value criterion structure. That is the kind of debate I really enjoy, since it is about the ideas at the heart of the question being debated.
Topicality, Kritiks, and other overly-debatery jargonish arguments will guarantee that I vote against you, unless your opponent is presenting a case that clearly and obviously has nothing to do with the resolution even to a casual observer. In other words, debate for me the way you would do in an exhibition debate for the general public.
Thanks!
