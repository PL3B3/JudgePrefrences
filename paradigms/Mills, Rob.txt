Debate, for me, comes down to impact comparison. There are a lot of ways to mitigate impacts, but ultimately every argument in every debate should have some bearing on an impact. To that end, impact comparison is absolutely the most important thing to do in the rebuttals. I have a few things that I'll mention concerning specific arguments below:

Performance: If you're using debate as a project, if you like to read poetry or sing or dance, if you like to play music or show videos, if you like to paint during your speeches or read passages from The Lord of the Rings, you should probably strike me. I won't automatically vote against you, but I will probably be more persuaded by arguments that follow traditional formats and have linkage to the topic. Of course, if you're neg - everything is par for the course.

Critiques: I read a lot of critique literature in my spare time, and I know a fair amount about the various arguments that authors make. I think critical theory has a place in academic debate, but I am weary of the lack of limits we've set up for those types of arguments. Negatives reading the K will be much further ahead if they explain their link arguments in the context of the affirmative, and explain how the alternative solves the case.

Theory/Topicality: The only thing I'll ask is a bit of pen-time.
