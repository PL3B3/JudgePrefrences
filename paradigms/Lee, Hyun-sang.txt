  This is my first year of judging LD Debate tournaments. I have not judged any rounds yet, this will be my first tournament. I am a lay judge not a flow judge. I cannot flow at all, and will simply write down notes for myself. I cannot understand at all when you "spread", please speak slowly. I will have difficulty understanding complex arguments unless they are explained extremely well to me. I judge based on clarity of the debater's case presented and how well the opponent's points are tackled. Overall I go by who persuaded/convinced me more!
