  I don't have a problem with speed, but if I can't understand I won't
flow it (obviously) and won't give you the benefit of the doubt, in
later speeches, that you said it. I think theory should have a
legitimate purpose (I won't intervene and ignore a theory argument
just because I think it's stupid but I'm persuaded by well-warranted
"I'm not being abusive" argument against silly theory) I have pretty
high standards for warrants for a prioris (off case, etc.) there has
to be a CLEAR reason it comes before the standard articulated in ALL
speeches for me to vote on it, otherwise I default to the criterion. I
won't vote on presumption for either side unles the debater explains
why I should.
