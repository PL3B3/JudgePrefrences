  I am a speech and debate coach. I have been judging since 2011.
  
 Speed-I don't mind speed as long as you are not speaking so fast that either your opponent or I cannot understand what you are saying. If I can't flow your side of the debate, you lose. There must be clash in debate. If your speed keeps your opponent from being able to debate you, I consider it abusive. I do not appreciate students who try to use the mannerisms of spreading without actually spreading. It makes it difficult to understand you and it hurts your ability to present your case.
  
 Theory-I do not appreciate theory cases unless your opponent has committed a serious infraction that makes the debate unfair. If so, please explain the infraction in detail.
  
 Burdens-Do not try to establish an abusive burden that does not give your opponent any opportunity to win. I will drop you for this.
  
 Sign posting-Please sign post so that I know where you are in the flow. Do not just use author's names to extend arguments (ie-extend Jones). I need more than that!
  
 Weighing-I appreciate weighing mechanisms that show how you want me to weigh your evidence over your opponents.
  
 Timing-I expect you to keep your own time. Please do not ask for time signals.
 
Presentation-Always stand when you are speaking and face me. I will be flowing and will likely not look at you much except during cross-ex.
 
Preparation-Come into the debate prepared. Do not ask for time to pre-flow. You should have done that earlier.
 
Technology-I am fine with students using their computers for speeches and evidence and their phones for timing.
 
Respect-I expect you to be respectful to both your opponent and your judge. Rudeness will cost you speaker points.
 
I am open to just about anything in your cases, but it still needs to link to the topic.
 
I look forward to hearing you debate!
