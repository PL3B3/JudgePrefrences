  I am a third year Parent Judge , – I am very traditional, in that I look for a good contention based battle. My pet peeves are, 1) I hate to give time signals – if I do I’m paying more attention to the clock than to your case – I should be listening and flowing, not counting down with hand signals. 2) Stupid use of speed – I can handle a little bit of speed if you are clear, but please slow down for your tags… I will give you a “clear” chance – but I really favor a reasonable paced smooth logical presentation -If I can’t understand it I can’t flow it, and I can’t judge it . and 3) Process, check to make sure your judge and opponent are ready before each speech ….…. I’m not really big on theory and will rarely vote on it. Your job is to make it easy for me to vote for you. This means being organized with your thoughts and presentation – don’t make me jump all over my flow. Give me good roadmaps and signposts, make sure you extend dropped points, give me clear voters at the end.
