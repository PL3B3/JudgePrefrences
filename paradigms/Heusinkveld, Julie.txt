  I take the notion of tabula rasa as literally as I can-- this is your debate within which you create the discursive rules, other than the golden rule. To this end I highly encourage you to frame your debate in terms of where my ballot goes and why. Sometimes this is interpreted to read that I just adore theory and/or performance-- I don't-- but again, the topics of discussion are not up to me. My responsibility as judge is to determine who most convinced me using whatever metrics you tell me to. Don't take this as an opportunity to eschew your evidence and training, they're effective for a reason. If no framework is provided I default back to policy maker.

I am comfortable with whatever arguments and argumentation you are comfortable with, of course clearly, persuasively, soundly argued. I flow meticulously.

Since the debate's quality rests entirely on your shoulders, it is in your best interest to do as well as you can, be thorough, keep it clean.

The one thing that I am very, very strict on is timing and decorum. Don't steal prep time! Don't be snotty! Don't talk over each other in CX! etc etc.
