Though I have been a debate coach for three years, I still consider myself a novice when it comes to the upper echelons of debate. From my experience as an English teacher, I can track the logical progression of an argument, but I require road maps and clear explanations without logical leaps. Logic, and not spreading, determines my decision. Essentially, if a debaters’ insistence on spreading interferes with my understanding of a logical thread, that burden lays with the debater, not the judge.

Effective arguments begin with a solid premise, then build logically through to a solid conclusion. For this reason I appreciate debaters who know to clearly state where their arguments are going and are able to clearly articulate and repeat their most important points.

Evidence is a means, not an end. Successful debaters do not turn a debate into a reading contest; successful debaters adhere to a classic structure of making a claim, supporting that claim with evidence, then providing a cogent warrant. Evidence is never self-evident; it requires set-up and follow through in the form of a warrant.

Cross-examination (CX) should be used for clarification and for building a plan, not for being disrespectful or having a moment to tell friends about. I take the rule of not judging CX very seriously.

Constructive speeches are important, but rebuttal speeches often sway my decisions the most. A team’s ability to accurately and clearly conclude any sort of logical thread in a rebuttal speech always provides the reason for my decision. 

Disrespectful debaters will never get my vote for a win. Debate is a sport of the mind and like in any sport, sportsmanship is important.
