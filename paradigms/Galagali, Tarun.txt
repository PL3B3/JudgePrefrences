  I debated for three years at Monta Vista High School (Cupertino, CA) from 2006-2009. I cleared at VBT, Harker, and picked up bids at the Alta Silver & Black Tournament and the UC Berkeley Invitational. I'm comfortable with speed, but you'll need to be clear (I won't yell clear) and you will definitely need to pause before card names. The only thing I need you to do is give me a standard. You can run whatever you'd like to run, but I will need an evaluative framework of some sort. I will not vote on potential abuse and I do not think education is a voter. I really like good weighing. I appreciate decency, a good sense of humor, and sophisticated thought. And that's pretty much it. Otherwise, debate is your game to play - enjoy it while it lasts.
