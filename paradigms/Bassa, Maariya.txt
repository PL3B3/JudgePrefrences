  So I'm a four year high school debater.
Speed is not a problem, however if you're not clear I'll warn you.

I really am starting to prefer off-case arguments, but that doesn't mean I hate on-case, off case is just more interesting to me.
This is evidence based debate, make sure your paying attention to the evidence used, if the other team is using cards from some guy sitting in his
basement tell me to disregard the card.

T- I WILL vote solely on T, I think if your not topical, then you deserve to lose regardless of everything else. At the same time, neg if your going for
T make sure you have thoroughly explained all the standards and make sure you extend why T is a voter.

CP- fine, I like perms.

K- Are fun, I know my K's well enough, however you need to to be able to defend what the world will look like under your K.
Also I do buy aff framework so neg, if you're running a K but don't answer framework then you lose.

Impact analysis needs to happen, aff even if you're losing on the DA, show me why even if a terrorist attack kills 1 million, by doing your plan your saving
1 billion.
