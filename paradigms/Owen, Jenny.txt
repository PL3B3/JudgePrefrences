  I judge for Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. 

Previous debate and practical experience: High school policy debate (1977-1981); practiced criminal and family law.
How I decide LD Debates: In LD, I want to see debaters choose and defend their values/criterion best in comparison to their opponents within the context of the resolution. I value applied reasoning rather than mere evidence recitation. 
Unique Views on LD Arguments: I view LD debate burdens traditionally but am open to and welcome nontraditional cases.
Presentational Preferences? I value clear communication. I can handle fast talking, but don't appreciate spreading.
