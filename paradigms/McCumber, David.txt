  So. First a couple of things about my judging experience-
I'm a parent judge affiliated with Los Alamos High School in New Mexico. I've done lots of judging on our local circuit but almost no national circuit judging for LD.

Now about what I look for in a round-
I am of the opinion that debate should be a persuasive activity and thus I would like to see slower style.
I'm also pretty traditionalist- values and criteria are really important to how I weigh a round and I'm not fluent enough in critical or policy style argumentation to give you a fair decision. I am a lawyer so I expect logic and reasoning in your case.
So if you run those arguments, don't rank me very highly.

Grab-Bag-
 If you run arguments I've told you not to, your speaker points will drop quickly. The same is true if I can't understand you when you speak- either too quickly or into your computers.
I will not tolerate rude, racist, or sexist behavior in the round. If I see any of these, I will give you a loss 20. Eloquent, persuasive speakers matter to me.
