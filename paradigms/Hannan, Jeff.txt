I am doing a hard restart this year on my paradigm.

Here's a short version: my decisions will be better when debaters read their tags slowly, explain things clearly as early and often as possible, and order and explain my decision for me. My decisions will be worse when debaters assume I know things about the world, assume I will do work to understand or impact their arguments, or do not signpost/locate clearly on the flow.

I have no strong argumentative or stylistic preferences other than this: do not be a bad human being. If you are mean to your opponents or partner, either interpersonally or structurally, I will be seeking ways to vote against you.

I may ask to be on the email chain, but I will not read your arguments for you; I believe strongly that this is a communicative activity, and if I don't understand the words you read or say during the round, I will be unlikely to go and read them myself to understand them better.

PF specific stuff:
If it's not in the final focus, I will not evaluate it unless I have to.
if it's in the final focus, it needs to have been in the summary, which means it probably needs to have been in the case or rebuttal.
I flow, and will evaluate offense that is linked to a standard or framework for the round; you will like my decision most if you tell me how to make it.

I struggle to evaluate arguments that are just "Johnson says [claim]". I need warrants and explanations. If the evidence does not, or a team cannot, explain why an argument is true or what the argument would look like, then I am very unlikely to vote for it.
