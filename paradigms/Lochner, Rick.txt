  I am a lay judge whose son went to TOC for Policy in 2009. This is my seventh year judging Policy.

My philosophies can be summed up as:
Enjoy the round. The debate is for the debaters.I will vote on most anything if you can convince me, but you may have to lead me, so make sure that your arguments are clear.I don't think Freshman or Sophs should run K's.All things being equal, I tend to vote for the world (Aff/Neg) in which I live longer or better. Again, explain why your world is superior.I'm OK with speed, just make it easy for me to hear the plan, harms, etc.On evidence, make sure I get source and date and then read the cards at the speed of your choosing. Also, don't make the evidence say something that it doesn't. This is when I'm likely to ask for cards, especially if there is a dispute.I prefer to have the arguments win the round rather than the cards. I do not want to look at a bunch of cards at the end and replay the debate. It should all be in my flow already.I prefer clash in round (otherwise, it's tough to judge)I want the winning side to know why they are winning.If a team stumbles into a winning argument, but doesn't give it the necessary weight, I'm unlikely to give them a low point win.I want you to enjoy the round and debate again.Fox News, Herman Cain or Sean Hannity evidence is always good for a chuckle.Make me enjoy the round and it's guaranteed that you will, too.
