I was a primarily a 2N/1A. 
I am now an assistant coach for Juan Diego. 
I like debates on both sides of the ideological divide. I myself have forwarded arguments from a wide range of stylings, from feminism to hegemony. As long as your argument has a clear claim, warrant, and impact I am willing to vote on it. 
If I don't understand the argument you are trying to make, the chances of me evaluating it are slim. Take a second to ask yourself "is this coherent?" before you make an argument. Too many debaters stop the argument creation process at identifying what they need to say, and forget how important it is to find an effective way to say it.
Specificity is key. I am compelled to vote for contextual examples, in-depth refutation and historical examples. I reward specific strategies and research with higher speaker points. 
Quality over quantity. I appreciate the teams that can overwhelm the line by line with original insights or analysis that comes from a few (longer) cards. This applies to any quadrant of the ideological spectrum, from politics uniqueness to critique links 

I will work very hard as a critic. My biggest pet-peeve when I debated were judges that didn't respect the time and effort that went into preparing for debates. I will be excited to judge you and provide (hopefully insightful) feedback. 

Paperless transition of evidence will NOT be timed. 

Alternative use time if all debaters want. 

Cutting cards during the debate is okay. 

Receiving coaching is not. Or clipping cards. Or stealing an obnoxious amount of prep. 

Be Nice. I have no tolerance for discrimantory language, gestures, or actions. Have fun, learn lots. 
If you have questions, feel free to ask. 
P.S. Here is a reward if you are still reading... Cat puns in rebutals will earn extra speaker points. With a .5 ceiling.
