Quick version, FAQs and Pet Peeves
I'm Parker, u can call me that, or judge, or whatever. He/They/She are all fine.
Plz don't shake my hand.
On the big question of framework, i vote either way constantly.
Competing interps are best
There is NOT "always a risk"
Fairness can be, but isn't always, an impact
I flow cx
Speed is good
Postround me if you want
In general, all arguments are winnable, just weigh your impacts.
EXCEPTIONS: Racism, sexism, transphobia, explicit suicide advocacy (there are more nuanced ways to read death good), homophobia, ableism. Do not advocate for these things as good. I am generally in the camp that all arguments are debatable on the technical level, but these exceptions are critical to avoid explicit in-activity violence that prevents people from competing. This is apriori. I have only had to utilize this exception once. 
OVERVIEW
My ballot decides whether or not the proposition of the affirmative (plan, advocacy, performance are all forms of propositions) is better than the proposition of the negative (whether that be the status quo or an alternative/counterplan). Exceptions: a question of whether or not the presentation of the aff or neg ought to be rejected apriori (theory [t, condo, etc.] or critique-based [misgendering, etc.]), unless I have been presented with a persuasive reason to not consider one side's proposition, I will default to weighing one position against the other. In the case the debate must be resolved apriori to the "substance" of the debate I will still end up weighing one "world" (e.g. the interp) against another (the counterinterp).
Tech/Truth: Don’t change your arguments for me. I do believe debate (at the fundamental level) is a game, and therefore I'm open to any kind of strategy that will help you win that game. I will end the debate in favor of one proposition resolved only by the arguments in the round. I will use the technical aspects of the round to reach this decision.
ETC: That is my fundamental philosophy which I will not deviate from. For my biases on your favorite arguments see below, as well as some useful info on my preferences on your delivery and administrative practices. An appendix is included of my past voting record so you can consider the effectiveness of your strategy in front of me in the past. This is a policy debate paradigm, my paradigms for other events are also listed in the appendix if I am judging you in one of those events.
EXPERIENCE
4 years of debate for Shawnee Mission East high school in Kansas, currently debating for the University of Missouri at Kansas City (junior), asst coach at Shawnee Mission East (3 years).
SPECIFIC ARGS
T: T is my favorite argument and the one I have the most experience with. It is often the most strategic option regardless of affirmative. T is not (fundamentally) evil, and using it as a time suck is just good strategy. RVIs are bad, but T can be impact turned if done well by a K aff. The neg needs an interp and the aff should have a counterinterp. If you don’t meet any interp you probably lose. I will evaluate under competing interpretations almost always. Reasonability is silly. I have not judged enough T debates this year, so I might not be knowledgeable about the distinctions in literature, however, please do delve into those distinctions as this is a fascinating debate to me.
CPs: Counterplans are cool. Functional competition is a good standard in my opinion. Textual competition can be debated, functional competition likely trumps it. You need a NB the CP avoids and links to perm do both. Cheating CPs are fine, win theoretical justifications+substance and you will win, I will likely not reject team unless dropped. I have, however, voted on theory against CPs before.
Statuses: In general, condo is good, dispo is silly, uncondo is ridiculous. If you’re going for condo bad, you’ll need an interpretation and reasons why your specific interp is good. Don't assume infinite condo is outrageous, I will attempt to evaluate theory with the same technical rigor as substance. That said, IF YOU'RE GONNA READ STATUS THEORY ASK WHAT THE STATUS IS.
DAs: I've found I've sat (or had an argument) in a couple of close rounds with DA/Case strategies against the negative. I have difficulty assigning "minute risk" on disads if a no link is particularly persuasive and/or conceded. If I can't tell a story about why the aff is bad then it's difficult for me to vote negative. This is not to say that I won't vote on these strategies, in fact, I enjoy them, but you do have to have a clean 2nr that covers your bases particularly on the link level, or alternatively have a large amount of mitigation. Therefore, DAs are best with CPs or some kind of framing trick.
Ks: The neg can critique multiple portions of the affirmative. "Weighing the plan” is probably also good. Work out these nuances. Fiat illusory is not a trick, it's already assumed by the aff. Other K tricks can be important, so pay attention. I don't necessarily have any idea what you are talking about. You can’t get away just reading blocks at your computer, you will need to understand the argument you are making, and then convey that understanding to me.
K Affs: They can be a valuable way of interacting with the resolution. K affs should at least engage the vast majority of the resolution. While K affs are great, framework is also a good, strategic argument. I find fairness claims generally more persuasive than education ones.
STYLE PREFERENCES
Flowing: If it's on one sheet in the 1nc it will remain that way on my flow. Each individual sheet will be straight down, overviews not separate. Any "global overview" will be on the first sheet in the order. You can flow a separate sheet if you want but I won't.
Speed: Speed is generally good. Maintain clarity. I will clear you a few times and if you don’t get clearer, it’s your problem. I will continue to attempt to flow but there are no guarantees on how good my flow is anymore. I know I'm not flowing the full body of the card but I should be able to hear it. If the text is unclear you might as well have not read it.
CX: CX is important. I flow cross-x. I will consider arguments made in cx as important arguments in the debate, and I will hold you to your cx answers. Open is better than closed, you should allow your partner to ask/answer questions during their "turn" or else their speaks will go down. In debates where one team is "Maverick", the Mav debater gets to decide whether they want open or closed, 2 on 1 cx is definitely unfair.
Language: I don’t mind swear words. Please, however, do not shift your language toward the other team. In particular the use of racial/sexist/homophobic/transphobic slurs in any way other than as a mechanism for argument (to be used only by individuals who are affected by those slurs) or in the course of describing that term to forward argument, will not be tolerated, and will result in 0 speaks and a loss. For gendered language (guys, incorrect use of pronouns), I will not automatically reject the team although I take this very seriously. I do think that mistakes happen very often, and I won’t be very punishing at first offense, as long as there is an apology. However, repeated offenses and disdain for this issue will likely be punished regardless of arguments.
Postrounding: you are welcome to. I enjoy a team that argues passionately for what they care for. Not license to be a jerk but I do appreciate well stated questions to my RFD.
ADMINISTRATION
Clipping: Always cheating, and I have a zero tolerance policy. If you are making an accusation have proof and be willing to stake the round on it. I will immediately stop the round, review the evidence, and come to a conclusion. If the accused party did clip they will receive the Loss and 0 speaks, the accusing party will receive 0 speaks if the accused party did not clip. I will surrender to tournament regulations if need by on questions of the punishment.
Disclosure: I will orally disclose my decision after the round provided a couple things
the tournament allows it -- if they don’t (yay KS tournaments) I will at the very least disclose some comments I had about the round.y’all disclose too. I want both teams before the round to disclose a reasonable amount of time before we start. I want the negative to disclose past 2NRs and the aff to disclose the aff that will be read (unless they are breaking new). I have the potential to vote on disclosure theory.Prep: Flashing is not on prep time unless it's clear you're abusing it. Don't steal prep.
Speaks: Adjusted based on tournament pool: A novice 29.5 =! a TOC circuit 29.5. I will use CDR's points rubric which is based on statistical analysis.

Appendix 3: Constraints a. Personal constraints
[none currently]
b. Team constraints
1) Shawnee Mission East
c. Tournament constraints
1) NSDA Nationals
Appendix 4: LD Paradigm Probably won't end up judging much of this, except at occasional Spring tournaments in Kansas or in Missouri. I have limited LD experience, I debated it for a couple of years in KS and went to NSDA nationals. Speed, Ks, plans are fine, I may not fully understand the nuances of LD theory however, so more explanation may be needed. I will flow (on paper because I don't have an LD flowing template), please let's try to all flow the round in the same way, tell me how many sheets I should be flowing the AC/NC on, and where you're going. There seems to be no universally agreed upon way to flow an LD round so I will bend to the will of you all.
In terms of how I evaluate the round, this will be determined by the debaters. I never really understood value/value-criterion as anything other than the framing of the round. I think at the end of the round I (unless a plan/cp has been read) will be deciding whether or not the resolution is good/true. What this means can be interpreted and explained out by the debaters, but in general I'm not deciding who's value is better or who's criterion is better. This means if the neg wins their value and criterion this is not an auto-win, if affirming the resolution fulfills this criterion better (as per the arguments on the flow), then the aff wins.
Appendix 5: PFD Paradigm I don't judge a lot of this, but since I started judging Missouri tournaments I have ended up in this event on occasion. This is probably the mainstream debate event in which I have the least experience, and I tend to enjoy judging the other events more. I will evaluate the debate on the flow, and I will attempt to flow (although this is difficult given the structure and style of PFD, my flows often get messy). Your case (pro or con) should include offensive reasons to vote for your side, not just defense. I think that, however, whichever team goes second (even before the first crossfire) should attempt to answer the points of the other team's case in their first speech. I believe that the second speech should also extend points from their previous speech, even and especially if dropped by opponents. I will consider these dropped (or kicked) arguments unless both sides drop all their cases in which case it is a wash and I'll go on evaluating the debate from there.
Crossfire is too often used as an excuse to talk at each other and not to each other. Even though you don't have to be directly posing questions during crossfire, it shouldn't just be stating arguments back at each other, respond and adapt your arguments throughout the crossfire. I would prefer if this was treated more like cross-x is in debate, but I understand why it isn't.
