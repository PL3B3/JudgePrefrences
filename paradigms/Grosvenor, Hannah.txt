  I am honestly going to make this really short so here we go! 

First about me: My name is Hannah Grosvenor, and I have debated LD for four years at Okoboji High School in Milford, Iowa. I debated on the local and national circuit in Iowa, South Dakota, and Minnesota. I will be debating at The George Washington University next fall. 

On Speed: I'm fine, I will yell clear twice then start taking away speaks. Don't go unbearably fast especially if you can't that is the most annoying thing in the world and will for sure dock speaks. 

How I evaluate rounds: Okay, so I love framework. Therefore Philosophy is cool. If you are running something very dense slow down and make sure you explain it and warrant it well. Just because I love framework doesn't mean that I go around and read every single philosophy. Standards are super important; this is LD. Make sure you uphold it and make clear arguments on your opponents. If you are clearly winning the standards you are clearly winning the round. Skep is cool too. 

On Theory/K's/CP's/DA's.... ect: Okay, I am not a fan of Policy arguments. This is LD, not policy. Don't run them unless you clearly link, or there is clear abuse. Don't use it as a time suck. That will hurt your speaks. If there is clear definite abuse Theory or T is okay. I don't really care for DA's. If you are going to run a K in front of me, you better explain it well. In short: policy arguments should be a last resort. 

Okay let's recap: Standards and Framework are the best way to go for winning a round in front of me. Theory comes first if you tell me it does as for every other argument. Make sure to make clear voters, and make my job easy. Do that and you'll have better speaks.
