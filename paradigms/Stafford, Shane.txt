Policy Debate
New one coming by Wednesday Sept 21

I'm a little behind on this, some basic comments

Topicality -- I'm tough to win on this. Negative should probably not go for it.

Theory -- mostly view this as reject the argument, for sure with only two conditional. But often in general that is true.

Framework -- again finding it hard to vote on this. I am not seeing very good impacts that the negative can defend as unique to have USFG in the plan. But, Affirmative, please answer topical version of the plan, it should be easy. I do think the affirmative should be in the area of the topic and should advocate something, I'm less convinced that purely survival strategy affirmatives are fair.
