  Hello all,
I am a BSM coach/teacher/judge
I have judged at a few tournaments this year, but only observed rounds on the Nov/Dec topic. This is my sixth year judging.
Topicality is very important for policy debaters, as is being reasonable, performing, and planning for counters.

In LD I appreciate value and criterion analysis at the top of the case and impacting back to that analysis throughout the round. I am not a fan of one tiny extension that becomes a black hole into which your opponent's case is sucked, unless you really have found the soft underbelly of your opponent's position, so please keep the whole debate in mind; and, use analysis in refutation--don't just fling cards back and forth at each other. Finally, crystallization is important--let me know what you think the round boils down to.

Oh yeah...and signpost.

Thank you and good luck!
