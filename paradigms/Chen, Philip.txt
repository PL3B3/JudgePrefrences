I have low familiarity with the topic so please do your background explanations and spell out your acronyms.
Clarity is important and will reflect in your speaks. I am not the best at flowing a blizzard of quick analytics so I would appreciate if you used emphasis and varied your tone.

 Specific things
 Zero risk is possible, but teams often fail at explaining this and lose to "only a risk" arguments.

 Counterplans -- Please slow down on CP texts. Condo is fine. I lean slightly aff on CP theory questions, such as consult and word PICs.

 Kritiks -- I would like you to have specific link analysis and explain how aff/neg impacts weigh under your framework. I also want the neg to explain the alt thoroughly and how it interacts with the aff, instead of throwing random jargon at me. A good defense of the aff usually beats kritik first arguments; it's hard to exclude the aff impacts when they're supported by solid evidence. I won't vote for K tricks (self-fulfilling prophecy, floating pik, etc.) unless well developed in the block.

 K Affs -- I think many framework arguments such as “USFG/T/resolution is fascist” reflect a bad effort at meeting the resolution. Instead, the K aff should propose an interpretation of the res and try to win that the way aff interacts with the res is reasonable.

 Topicality -- I would prefer if T was well-developed in the block before you go for it. Otherwise, it doesn’t seem like a real issue.
