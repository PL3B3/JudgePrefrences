  First, I am a COMPLETELY LAY judge. I don't have much debate experience besides judging novice rounds and learning from my child. Here's my paradigm:
I want debaters to speak slowly and clearly. Do NOT speak fast. If you start speaking at a rate faster than conversational pace, I will not understand what you're saying. And if I don't know what your saying, I will NOT vote for you. This is the biggest part of my paradigm, so DON'T violate it.
If you guys are running arguments that don't follow the traditional value-criterion-contention format, that's fine. For those arguments, just take the time to simplify things and explain them really well. Your ability to explain these things well is critical for me and debate in general. I heard a few of these types of arguments are called critiques, theory, and plans. The key is explaining these arguments.
In general, I prefer debaters who explain things well to me than those who just make a bunch of arguments. I'm not going to buy your side if you stand up in your rebuttal and make a ton of short arguments. Quality> quantity
Speaker points will be awarded based on your performance skills, both in presentation and argument wise. Normally, I don't do low-point wins.
