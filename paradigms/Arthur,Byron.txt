LD Judge Philosophy

Background: I have been in this activity since 1980 when I started as a policy debater. Eventually I began coaching and found myself as the Director of Forensics at Jesuit High School in New Orleans where I coached both policy and Lincoln-Douglas. Today, I serve as the Director at Holy Cross School in New Orleans where I coach policy, Lincoln-Douglas, and Public Forum.

Speed: I am fine with your speed as long as I can understand you. I have been involved in enough fast debates as both a student and a coach, that your celerity is not overly impressive to me.

Sometimes less is more! : The most impressive debaters are those who have an ability to articulate the depth of an argument. I do not add up how many arguments either side is winning and then make a determination, I love a good story and I want to know that you understand tis argument and not that you are running it because someone on your team handed it to you and it sounds cool.

Counterplans: I actually like the idea of a counter plan in Lincoln-Douglas but in front of me it must meet all of the same burdens as one in policy debate. Beware: I am not a fan of the topical counterplan so do not waste your time. Conditionality is ok since the resolution is the point of stasis and I am open to hearing possible alternatives to it.

Cross -Examination: I am not flowing it but I am paying attention. I will not vote on something that you say in c-x that you do not argue in a speech but I will hold you to the answers that you give for the sake of impeachment. In other words, make certain that your advocacy is consistent.

Black People, Women, and other good thoughts: The willingness of students to introduce arguments exploring racist and sexist attitudes and/or practices is not only permissible but desirable. While I know that this has been a point of controversy in both high school and college debate I am more than happy to listen to a healthy debate on these issues.
