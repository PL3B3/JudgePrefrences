  Tab judge, will vote on most anything except for abuse (unless you can actually make it legit) and aff theory offense (unless it's not a timesuck and total BS). I have a few style concerns, though.
1) Tell me where to flow stuff
2) Do impact calc
3) You're spreading (if that's how you roll) should be crystal clear and slow down on tags.

Have a lot of experience in policy and speech events, with some experience in parli.

Feel free to ask questions!
