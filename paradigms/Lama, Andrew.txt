  [Lama debated at Millburn High School, in Congress for 1 year and then in PF for 3 more. He is open to anything but be wary of topics he may have limited understanding about like kritiks or theory. He is well versed in international relations/law so don’t read dumb I-Law arguments – Wesley Hu]

Bring all arguments through the flow. Weigh for me.
If you don't refute framework then it's not my problem if everything on your side drops. Give me a clear framework to follow in the round and tell me why I prefer it. 
I'm good with all arguments and critiques so make sure you respond to everything and as for speed just make it intelligible.
