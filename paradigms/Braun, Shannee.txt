  I prefer traditional, slow debate with good impacts back to value and criterion, well-warranted arguments, and clash. I can flow and understand speed but would rather not hear spreading unless it is absolutely necessary.
I see persuasion as more valuable than speed, and would rather vote off a well-explained, well-warranted argument than a blippy extension in the last few seconds of the round. I think it's important to be able to weigh arguments and be able to discuss how different arguments interact within the round.
