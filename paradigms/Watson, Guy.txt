  I'll just keep this short. I did 4 years of LD in high school, and I prefer a more traditional approach. If you want to do progressive stuff, I'm fine with that, but just keep in mind that I will probably miss something that you don't want me to. As for paradigm, I typically end up looking at the framework that the round was built on, and calculating impacts from that framework. Seriously, put in the time on the values and criterions, and it'll pay you back. I mean, other than that, the round really is yours to have fun with. Do what you want, just remember that having a fun round is one of the best things that can happen to a debater. They're few and far between, but worth it. :-)
