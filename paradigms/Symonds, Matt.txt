  Debated policy for four years in high school, currently a student at UC Berkeley. 

Please introduce topic-specific acronyms by reading their full name first. 

Open to any kind of argument, K, case, T, theory, framework, etc. If no framework is given I will default to "aff must demonstrate a positive net benefit to the plan they propose vs alts defended by neg" including status quo. If neg says in 2NC "we think status quo is bad as well" but doesn't present a defense of condo or dispo I will vote aff if the CP/alt is dropped.

I know much much more about policy than kritikal arguments so please contextualize abstruse kritikal literature.

If I signal to go slower, please respect the request.

If you engage in character attacks I will dock speaker points. If you're extremely hostile and the other team complains that you've made the debate an unsafe space I will consider whether to award a loss on that basis. Threshold for doing so is high.
