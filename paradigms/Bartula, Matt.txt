  Hey guys so I am really simple. I just want to see you actually debate. Narrow down the debate in the rebuttals. Don't just fling arguments out there and hope they stick. I don't take prep for flashing. I really enjoy critical arguments but you actually have to explain them and run them right-- don't assume that I know what you are talking about. That's about it. Run what you want and do it well.
