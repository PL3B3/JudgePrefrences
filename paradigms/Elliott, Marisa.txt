I have been coaching and judging off and on for the last 9 years - I will try to do my best.

Please feel free to clarify any of this before the round:
Speed is not my favorite thing - especially when you lose clarity or have plenty of time left - I am not the quickest on the flow so it is probably in your best interest to slow down for me.

In round issues - argumentation should be clear and easy to follow, sign post and let me know where you are on the flow, there should be a clear value and criteria that is defended through the round. I am ok with theory and kritiks but I do go for the more straight forward arguments. Round should be made clear in rebuttals but not a list of various voters - pick what you are going for and stick to it - explain it well.

Speaker Points - I have a real problem with the abundance of 30's that are given out - 30 should be perfection which is rare - I average 26-28 in most rounds - any type of rudeness or abuseiveness and it will go much lower - part of a good speaker is civility under any situation.
