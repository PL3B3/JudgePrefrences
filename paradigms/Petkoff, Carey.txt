  I am currently the coach at Marcus High School in Flower Mound, TX. I have been the debate coach at Marcus for 9 years now. I did not debate in high school, but I did go to camp before I started teaching! My philosophy is definitely traditional, although I will listen to a wide range of arguments if they are well-articulated and clearly applied to the topic. Here are the specifics...

Rate of Delivery: Please be clear! This means that "spreading" is UNACCEPTABLE!! I can flow a moderate speed, but if I cannot understand you then I cannot vote for you. 

Criterion: Without a criterion, a case offers no clear weighing mechanism. I will use this to determine the round. All arguments need to link back to the criterion and it should be extended throughout the round. Pre-standards arguments are insufficient to win my ballot, I prefer a value and criterion extended and compared to the opponent's criterion and value.

Rebuttals & Crystalization: You should tell me why you are winning the debate. I will not do work for you!

Determining Winner: I focus on the key arguments/voters as well as the communication skills employed in the debate.

Use of Evidence: Evidence is almost mandatory. If there are no cards then the analytics better be very good.

Flow: I will flow the round as long as I can understand what is being said. If it is important to your case, tell me why it is, and why you are winning that argument!

LD Theory Arguments: Theory arguments while interesting in class, do not have a place in the debate round. Stick to the topical arguments.

Value Premise / Core Value: I prefer that there is a value, but I have and will vote for a debater even if they do not have one.

Definitions: They rarely are the basis for my decisions.

Speaker Points: I use a range of 25-30 and base the points on clarity within the round, signposting, communication, and respectful treatment of your opponent.
