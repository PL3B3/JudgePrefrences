  I've been a part of the debate community since the 90s, so to moderns that makes me slightly dated. With that being said I am familiar with all arguments, hyper evolved theory debates tend to be drowned out by the length of their blocks, I enjoy T debates, Counterplan Disad strategies are great, Kritikal debates need to be specific. Each team is allowed to establish their interpretation of framework and how arguments should function, in the end I look for clearly round and topic specific analysis, clearly impacted arguments, and clarification of how I should evaluate arguments in relation to each other. Be nice, focus on quality of argument, quantity is fine but make it specific. Feel free to ask more specific questions.
