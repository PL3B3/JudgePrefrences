Topicality: I would prefer it if you only ran this if the affirmative case is actually unreasonable and you think that you might go for it in the end.

K's: I love K's

Theory: Not a big fan of it, doesn't mean I wont vote on it I just hate debates that predominantly come down to theory.

In general: I do not like time suck args, try to be polite, be clear (I can handle speed, not mumbling), and stock issues are nice.
