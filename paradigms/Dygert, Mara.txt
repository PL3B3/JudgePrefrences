  My name is Mara Dygert and I am an alum of the high school speech and debate community. I competed for Asheville High School in North Carolina for four years and my primary focus during this time was Congressional debate. I have competed in Congressional debate on the national circuit and placed at numerous national tournaments. In addition, I competed in numerous other speech and debate events on the local circuit, so I do know what I am doing. 

No matter the event, the largest focus for me in a debate setting is the quality of evidence in relation to a legitimate and quantifiable impact. I want to know why your position or argument is correct, what evidence or theory exists to support you, and why that evidence or theory should matter to me. 

Speed and efficiency are important factors to consider, but enunciation and elocution should always be considered a top priority as well. It doesn't matter if you can read your whole case out in the allotted time given if I didn't understand a single word you said the entire time. 

Respect your competitor, the event, and the judge, and we should all have a good time.
