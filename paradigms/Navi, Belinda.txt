  I am one of the assistant coaches at Brentwood School in Los Angeles with Victor Jih. I actually debated circuit-level LD as Victor's student when I went to Archer, competing at the major tournaments including Stanford, Berkeley, Greenhill, Glenbrooks, Apple Valley, Blake, VBT, etc. I have been out of the activity when I went to school at Brown, but now have been coaching for the year and am familiar with the topic and the activity. Since I have not competed for a while though, you run the risk of me not evaluating the round the way you would like if you get excessively fast or if you run trendy off-topic arguments that you expect me to understand simply because of the shorthand descriptions you use. I'm not against arguments, but you'll have to make sure you explain them. Don't take impacts, links, etc. for granted and don't assume I'll put the round together the way you'll want me to. You need to be explicit with the ballot story.
