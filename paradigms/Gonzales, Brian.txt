I'll just go in order from what everyone asks me in LD. 


I mean this when I say, I will evaluate anything. If you have an argument that you have been dyeing to try, now is probably the time. I don't have arguments that I don't want to hear. So long as you do it in your style we will have a good time.



Speed: It's a speech activity, enunciate and use your voice effectively. I can keep up but I will stop flowing at the point that you begin to slur your words together. If you see me put my pen down then you better fix the issue. 


Kritiks: If your links are sound we wont have any problems. If you have unwarranted links then your chances of being voted up will dwindle.



Theory: Please slow down. Don't speed through the shell. Make sure I can understand it because I need to flow it. Otherwise, if you want to spread the shell how you would your evidence, best of luck. 



Public Forum:

This seems to be an issue that is as old as time itself, "Who gets first question?" 1st team does. 2nd team don't say "you can have 1st question." it makes you seem pretentious. Cross fire I don't care if you sit or stand just start CX. Make sure both speakers ask questions



Personal: Please be civil, I understand debates get heated but try to be friends at the end of the round. Have fun! Your doing an activity you enjoy make sure to smile. Please look up from time to time. Debate is a speech activity try to keep glares and "DID THEY REALLY JUST SAY THAT!?!" faces to a minimum. You can wear coats, scarves, whatever you need to make yourself comfortable while you debate. Ladies, you don't have to ask me if you have to wear heels because it's up to you. 


And if you get to the room early, make conversation. I'm human too, it's just as awkward for me to sit in a room with a stranger as it is for you.
