  I graduated from Bettendorf High School (2014). I qualified to the ToC my senior year. I am currently a freshman at the University of Iowa.

I'm fine with almost anything as long as it's not blatantly offensive. Speed is fine; I'll say clear and slow- don't be nervous if I yell clear, I won't dock speaks unless you don't listen to me. Weighing and explaining how arguments function in the round should be your top priority. Critical arguments are not the best idea in front of me-- I'm not familiar with the literature nor do I find them to be very compelling. Policy style arguments are fine, but I rarely ran them so keep that in mind.

On theory, I default to competing interps, no RVIs, and drop the debater. Feel free to make arguments for or against these. I don't like disclosure theory and I will not vote on new theory in the 2ar. If you have a bunch of theory spikes (or any other blips at the top of your AC) pretty please slow down on them.

Be civil in CX. I'm pretty nice with speaks, but please find me after the round to ask about them. If you want to ask questions after the round that's fine, but if you want to argue about the decision please let your opponent leave.

PLEASE HAVE FUN.
