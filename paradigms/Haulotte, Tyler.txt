  Hello, my name is Tyler.

I don't like to intervene. I really do not like to do it and would only do it in extraordinary circumstances, e.g. "vote against my opponent because of his/her skin color/gender/sexuality" in which case I kind of doubt that you care about the ballot anyways. My only hard and fast rule is that you must communicate in a way that I understand, in English, clearly, etc.. If you don't I'll say "clear", or "no se espanol", "louder", because I realize you can't know how well I understand your speech without my communication. Other than this, I'm fine with you running about anything, I ran everything from truth-testy prestandards, to deontology, to plans, to DnG, to virtue ethics.

I vote for the better debating, not necessarily my opinion of the better argument.
