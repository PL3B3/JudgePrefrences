  I debated for Vestavia Hills high school for four years.

I would prefer a more traditional debate that is not very fast. Please slow down from your regular super fast speed in front of me. Framework debate is great - please do it! Weighing between frameworks is very important. Theory is fine, but I'd prefer to see theory run only when there is clear abuse, rather than just frivolous theory. I didn't run policy arguments as a debater, so you'd be better off not LARPing in front of me.

I presume all frameworks collapse to util unless otherwise specified.

The best advice I can give is to just persevere through my RFD, just like I am.
