  Read what you want, have as much fun as you can, don't be pretentious. Kritik debates are interesting to me, but within reason. If you're planning on reading things like Lacan/Physcoanalysis (and by "things like" I mean highly theoretical and abstract criticisms). be prepared to adequately, and thoroughly explain them in the context of the aff because I am not very learned on those sort of subjects. However, I'm open to anything. So just read what you're comfortable with and have fun.
