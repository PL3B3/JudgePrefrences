  Graduated Bingham HS in 1999
Judge for Rowland Hall
Politically Independent

I debated in high school, but I primarily competed in IEs. I’ve occasionally judged at tournaments over the last few years and I enjoy working with students. I’ve been involved in a lot of educational organizations internationally (I taught in China, Nepal, and Ukraine) and regularly volunteer at schools.

I’m an easygoing guy and I enjoy a variety of arguments but I still expect you to communicate clearly and justify your arguments. I flow, but I’m probably more of a big picture judge. I rarely read evidence after a debate and I try to vote only on what was presented in the round.

Engage your opponent, present ideas that clash, and prove your impacts outweigh.
