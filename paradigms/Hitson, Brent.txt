  I am a lay judge with limited experience on the topic and with policy debate. I have done some training as a judge, but you will need to take extra care to explain your arguments clearly. As a new judge to this format of debate, be sure to enunciate key arguments and tags. If you spread, be certain to slow down for key information. I'm a lawyer (litigation) and will value smart, well-explained arguments. For the same reasons, CX will be particularly important to me. I am somewhat familiar with the stock issues and different types of negative arguments but am told that my basic orientation to judging is most like a traditional policy debate judge. I will expect the affirmative to defend an example of the resolution and the negative can attack the case from any number of different angles, including presentation of counterplans. The quality of your arguments will be more important to me than the number of your arguments, and I will reward clear, persuasive debating.
