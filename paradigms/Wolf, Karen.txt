  I was a policy debater in high school 35 years ago, and competed in state but not nationally. I have coached PF, LD and Congressional at a public high school for four years, and my students have had success on the national level. I am a traditional LD judge. I am persuaded by good use of logic and reasoning. I like philosophy included in the round, and I require a good value clash. I appreciate creativity and am open to any arguments that utilize logic, reasoning and rhetoric. I like depth of analysis. I like clear signposting. do not teach circuit style debating, and I am not the right judge for you if you prefer theory, K's, and spreading that is unintelligible to a person of solid intellect and intellligence. I am fine with speed as long as you are understandable, breathing normally, and making your arguments count. I require a formal presentation. Quality over quantity will generally carry the round.
