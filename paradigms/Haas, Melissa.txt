  I am a former educator and now a counselor. My daughter has been debating in policy for the past three years. However, I prefer the philosophical nature of Lincoln-Douglas debate and a positive outlook on life that does not end in nuclear war. I've been judging LD for three years.

Preferences: 

I value framework, and I will judge arguments in light of values and criterion. Rounds can be won or lost here.

I prefer debaters to debate the stated resolution, I do not often vote for critiques.

My ears are middle-aged, so speech must be slow enough to be clear. If I can't flow it, you will probably lose the round.

I am old-fashioned in the sense that I like a good clash of ideas and good rebuttals to every argument. If you drop a contention, you will probably lose the round.
