Real Philosophy:

General thoughts:
Debate is a communications activity - persuasion is very important in that it influences how I both consciously and, to a larger extent, subconsciously evaluate arguments. How you present an argument including ethos should not be discarded just because you're spreading.

I consider myself a "Tabs" judge - those who can concretely convince me about their argument will often win my vote.

Please slow down. If I can't follow you, I can't flow. If I can't flow, you can't win your argument.
