I did policy debate all 3 years in high school at Bingham. I'll vote for any argument but there are some arguments I like more than others.

Aff: I prefer topical affs that are straight. If you have a K aff then be sure to spend your time on the framework debate

Topicality: This is my favorite argument and I guess I'm what some may call a T hack. But this only means I have a high threshold for T. I default competing interps and if you want to win this debate i suggest you have offense on the standard debate

Disads: any disad is fine. Be sure to do impact calc

Counterplans: Im fine with any counterplan but be sure you have theory covered if your going for a consult

Kritiks: Not my preference but sometimes it's a good option. I never went for the K in high school but that doesn't mean I wont vote for it. I understand most K arguments just make sure you spend a lot of time on the framework and Alt debate. Give me good reasons why your k turns case or why your Alt solves case. If your K is offensive I'll vote for it.

Theory: Abuse and offense/defense. I suggest you just don't be abusive and you wont lose on theory

Overview: I'm a straight up judge and like impact calc in the last rebuttals. If you want speaker points sound good and be smart. Don't use all your speech or prep time if you don't have to. Play the game how you want and have fun.
