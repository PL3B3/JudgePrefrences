  About Me:
Debated in high school for 4 years, 3 years of PF and 1 year of LD.

Preferences: 
Not really into spreading in LD/PF - leave that in Policy - if I can't understand you I'll stop flowing
Please support your claims - but logical arguments are great as well 
I really enjoy organized arguments and speeches - show me where on the flow you are
Definitely not a fan of Kritiks
Stay professional during the round - please don't become hostile towards your opponent
