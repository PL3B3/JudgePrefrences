  Judge Type: Traditional

Please put less emphasis on what the author of your card says and present more analysis.

I have judged for several years at local debate tournaments for Rancho Bernardo, so I am familiar with debate, but I am a parent, so please do not spread. If you do, I will be unable to follow you, and therefore able to evaluate your arguments. To clarify, if you spread and I am unable to understand you, I will most likely vote you down and definitely lower your speaker points. That being said, I may yell "clear" if you try to do this.

Please make sure that you explain each argument clearly as well as the impact of the argument.

I prefer debate about the topic rather than complex debates about philosophy, so while you may argue philosophy in front of me, please don't make it the sole focus of the round.

If you want me to vote for something, you have to do sufficient analysis and explain the function of the argument and why you want me to vote for it. I will not vote on a 5 second argument with no explanation behind it.

Things you can do to get your speaker points raised:
- Make good, impacted arguments 
- Stay on topic and explain every argument clearly
- Speak persuasively; debate is meant to sharpen your public speaking skills
- Be polite and professional

Things you can do to get your speaker points lowered: 
- Spread
- Not impact your arguments
- Run seemingly nontopical arguments without explanation (e.g. if you are going to run Ks or theory, you MUST make it very clear)
- Run blippy arguments that aren't impacted
- Be rude to your opponent or me
