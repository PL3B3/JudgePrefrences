  I am a parent judge and recently hired assistant coach for Nevada Union, a rural public high school policy team in Northern California.

As a judge: 2014-15 is my third year judging, and I have judged a variety of events including novice policy, PF, Parli, Congress and some IEs. 
I can handle some speed, but please don't sacrifice clarity.I tend to take extensive notes but am not very skilled at flowing yet.My grasp of debate jargon varies, so don't rely on it too heavily.I don't have any strong opinions about the types of arguments you might run. However, I do want novice debaters to understand their own arguments and to know the content well.I appreciate signposting as much as possible.I base speaker points on a combination of fluency, clarity, volume, correct word usage and ability to speak articulately and logically in cross-ex and rebuttals.Please don't use racist/homophobic/sexist/ableist vocabulary or arguments.Please feel free to be assertive but not rude or disrespectful to your opponents.I will do my best to disclose my decision when tournaments allow it, but will not provide extensive RFD's in person. I will try to provide specific and helpful comments on my ballots.I will award low point wins when necessary, since I think argumentation trumps speaks.I have non-debate experience reading philosophy and critical theory.
As a coach: Put the emphasis on assistant rather than coach. I spend a ton of time around policy debaters but my argumentation coaching skills are limited by my lack of experience as a debater myself and my informal study of policy debate over the past two years.
