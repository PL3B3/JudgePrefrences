LD Paradigm:
Hi, I'm Jason Hu! I graduated last year and was very active in Public Forum throughout my four years of high school. My only exposure to varsity LD has been the few national tournaments I've judged at this year. In terms of speaking, I prefer a conversational speed (think a public forum round) or maybe a little faster (. I should be able to understand you and write down your arguments with relative ease. If theory/T, Ks, or policy-style arguments are your main strat, I am not your judge. Consider me a qualified traditional judge. I am willing to listen to your interesting cases as long as they're clearly explained. Do not expect me to flow all the random card names you throw at me without any justification or explanation. A card is not true just because it is a card. I value logical explanations and weighing more than technical jargon and techniques. If your strategy involves using techniques that purposefully exclude your opponent, I am not your judge. I will tank your speaks. I find debate to be a relatively elitist activity, and I think that the main goal of this activity should really focus on being inclusive and educational. Engage your opponent on whatever level of debate is comfortable for both of you.

Environmental arguments make me happy. 

Most of all, have fun! Debate is an activity meant for education and enjoyment.
