  Adam Groner's judging philosophy:

- I debated for four years at Glenbrook North High School. I currently coach and judge for New Trier High School.

- Speaking speed does not matter to me. The debater should do whatever they feel is their best.

- A priori, off-case args, critiques and overviews are fine.

- I will not vote on topicality. If one debater proves that the other has an argument that is not topical it does not win him/her the round, only the argument.

- I evaluate all arguments in the round through a standard/criteria. If an argument doesn't link into a standard then it does not impact the round. (there are some exceptions for a priori's, critiques, and theory, but they are rare)

- VOTING ISSUES: If a debater doesn't tell me which arguments are important in the round, all arguments are given the same weight. I don't care how voting issues are given, at the end or down the flow, but they are very important to me when I make a decision.

- Speaker points are based on coherency, word economy, time management, and entertainment. Remember to have a good time.

You can also ask me any questions you have before the round.
