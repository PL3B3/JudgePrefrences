  Judging philosophy â€“ A successful debater will present a clear and concise case that addresses the resolution and convinces the judge why their position is the correct choice. Modeled after the debates of Stephen Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, the debater must understand that the purpose of the debate is to win my vote. Hence, the successful debater will observe the voter (judge) for cues that the message is getting through.  Sign posting, speed of speech, clarity of thought are all important in getting the message across. The successful debater will lead me through the flow of the debate.  Philosophical arguments are acceptable and enjoyable provided they make logical sense and address the topic.  I would rather hear a good debate of philosophy and logic that encourages me to think outside the normal paradigm than to hear a rehash of the on line briefs. However, as an engineer, the argument must also have a strong foothold into the realm of reality. The successful debater will present a clear and logical argument, one that convinces me of the positives of their case while addressing the shortcomings of the opponent.  The debater must also remember that the resolution is the resolution. Reading more into the resolution is acceptable unless challenged by the opponent. If challenged, the debater must have a compelling argument for this assumption.  The value and criteria must link clearly to the resolution so that I have a good basis for evaluation of the case. 
 
It is important that both sides bring the debate to a clash so that I have a basis for decision. An apple to orange debate leaves me little room to weigh one side over the other.
