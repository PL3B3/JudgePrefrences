  Don't spew. I'm a grandma with bad hearing and I can't be expected to judge what you've said if I can't understand it. If you spew, you lose. 
Don't tell me how to judge. If I ask for help, (which I will) that is the ONLY time I want to hear how I should be judging. 
I have a few friends in debate, and I have judged before. 
I judge debate by the rules; Sweet talking, Sympathy Vote Pleas, and Badgering your Opponent will get you nowhere.
I look forward to being your judge.
