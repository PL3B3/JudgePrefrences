I debated for four years at Kent Denver, and I am not debating in college. While I debated relatively often on the national circuit, most of my rounds were in Denver where I was most often forced to debate in a slower, argument based style. As such, I'm not the fastest, but I should be able to keep up relatively well. I will let you know if you speed or clarity is an issue. 

I've been out of the debate world for a few years now so you shouldn't assume that I know anything about this year's topic or your specific arguments. 

I will listen to essentially any argument you put on the flow as long as you argue it well and explain its relevance to my decision clearly. That being said, I played around with Kritiks plenty in high school, but I was not a K debater. If you are, go ahead and run your arguments but note that you should do a lot of work on the framework flow (if that issue is brought up). It is absolutely key that you argue and explain the role of my ballot in your framework.

I tend to dislike pure theory debates, but if you choose to spend significant time on theory, slow down and spend a little time explaining the reasoning behind your prewritten blocks. 

I like topicality debates a lot because I think it forces teams to really pin down what the topic is for the year. I default to competing interpretations, but you can do pretty much anything as long as you give me strong framework to work under. 

I haven't done a lot of judging and I'm really laid back about it all so just feel free to ask questions and I'll be happy to answer.
