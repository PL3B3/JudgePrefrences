  Lets keep it short and get to the main points:
While I condone the use of theory when clearly required, I frown upon the strategic use of theory.As with theory, critics are acceptable to me, only when necessitated by the behavior of your opponent. I will not flow strategic critics or consider them in the weighing of the round.I can tolerate a brisk pace, but will not flow excessive spreading that surpasses the speed of speech reasonable to use in conversation.I am very responsive and reveal my thoughts through my expression. In other words: if you want to know what I think look at my face.I care first and for most about the content of your arguments however if your delivery detracts from your points it will be considered in my vote.The framework is of the foremost importance to me. If your argument does not link into the framework it will not be considered.
Good luck. I'll see you in round!
