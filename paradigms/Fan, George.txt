  Hi! I've been judging PF for about 2 years, since 2011. 

This is how I judge:
1. I flow
2. I listen to voters
3. I weigh appropriately

Make sure you tell me how to weigh or i will weigh on a utilitarian scale. 

PREFERENCES:
1. Talk slow. This is a communications event, and it's hard for me to understand with speed. Make sure you're clear when you talk also. 
2. Be respectful. No respect will not be tolerated. If I feel as if you are being conceited, your speaker points will go down. This is especially true in crossfire. 
3. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE give me voters in the summary and final focus! It is very important that you make clear what you want me to vote off of. 
4. If your argument does not have any impact to it, or if you don't tell me what the clear impact is, I will not weigh it in the round. 
5. NO JARGON. I'm okay with basic jargon like extend, weigh, framework, drop, etc. but if you use too much jargon I won't be able to understand you, and thus will not vote off of your arguments. 
6. When you come into a round, I expect the evidence to have what it's normally supposed to have and a LINK. These days many teams don't have the link with them. I want to see the link and the full article upon request. If you cite a Google Book, save it somehow. 

Hopefully I'll be your judge at some tournament!
