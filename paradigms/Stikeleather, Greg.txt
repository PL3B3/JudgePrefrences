  
I judge for Palo Alto High School and was a former high school speech and debate champion in Illinois.

I am a traditional judge insofar as I prefer resolutional debate and clear impacts to a standard. Logical appeals work best in front of me, and I’m looking for a clear claim, warrant, and impact in every argument you make. That said, if you run a different style of case and your argument is clear, reasonable, and logical, then I will likely to vote on it but only if arguments against it don't make sense.
I do not have a background in debate theory, (and theory annoys me) so you are taking your chances if you run it in front of me. If you do, I will evaluate it the same as I evaluate any other argument in the round.
I’m not a fan of a lot of heavy framework and prefer that you not bring up arguments that ask me to evaluate impacts before or outside of the standard.
I believe that debate is foremost an educational and persuasive opportunity and thus I will neither flow not tolerate speed above a conversational pace. My standard speaker points are 27s with adjustments for clarity, persuasive appeal, and humor. Making me laugh will always help you in the round.
