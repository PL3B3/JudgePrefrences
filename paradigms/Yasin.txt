  Saif Yasin Judge Philosophy

I have been on the Forensics circuit since my Freshman Year of high school and have been judging on the circuit for two years. When competing I was an extemper and did debate on occasion. I am currently a parlimentary debater on the apda circuit.

What I like to see in a good debate: Clash, Sign Posting, CLEAR CLEAR IMPACTING.

I am mostly interested in watching traditional debate, but would be interested in progressive forms if done well.One think that I usually do not enjoy is Ontology. However, I really enjoy innovative directions in attacking the resolution so using counter plans are one of my favorites tactics. Regarding speaking, I can deal with speed but I am extremely lenient on speaker points and more focus on what you are saying.

The biggest thing that I vote off of is the flow. If you let me keep track of you on the flow well, you will do much better.
