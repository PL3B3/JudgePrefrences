I debated on the local and TOC circuits during high school, so I'll (probably) know what you're talking about. That said, a couple things to keep in mind.
I'm not gonna pretend that I (a) can understand full speed spreading and (b) want to hear a high school kid choke out as many words as possible while looking like a drowning fish. Please, go a bit slower and focus on being a good speaker. If you can do that while making simple, true arguments, you're well on your way to getting good speaks.
As a general sidenote, please avoid double breathing. Double breathing should be reserved for crying children
I may say clear. I may not. You should keep track of whether I'm flowing either way.
I'm fine with theory, role of the ballot, and whatever arguments you want to make. Justify your arguments fully.
Please don't read underdeveloped arguments. Imagine I'm a toddler annoyingly (or adorably) asking you "why's that" 2-3 times. If your explanation doesn't answer the question every time, you need to explain it better.
Don't try to act "technical" or "progressive" for its own sake. If anything, avoid esoteric jargon as much as your arguments allow. Seriously, you look ridiculous
Be mindful of your opponent. If they clearly don't know what theory or a critique is, then don't run it. Don't spread them out just because you can. If you have to resort to arbitrary, esoteric gimmicks to beat someone with less experience than you then you're a lot less talented than you think.
Don't be shifty in CX. If you cant explain an argument well in CX I'll assume you (a) stole it from a teammate and didn't bother to understand it fully or (b) are being intentionally shifty to gain an advantage over your opponent. Either way, expect your lack of coherence to be reflected in a lack of speaker points.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. Just remember that I don't judge enough to tell you anything from experience. I'll just be guessing.
