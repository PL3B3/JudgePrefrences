I normally don't judge LD but my parameters for any debate are about the same:

-Define what you as the aff or neg are trying to achieve by passing this resolution
-A mandate
-Each contention should also come with an explanation of its warrant and impact
-Your arguments should have clash; it's so hard to judge a debate with two separate cases going in two different directions!
-If you're running a K, be clear...I've heard many many confusing ones and ultimately, I can't vote for you if you run it wrong or in a way that doesn't make sense
