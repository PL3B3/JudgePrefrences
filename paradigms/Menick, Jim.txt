  LD Coach since 1995, now doing almost exclusively PF since 2012. Mostly I'm in tab rooms, but I like to pick up a ballot once in a while.

I don't judge often, so excessive speed is counterproductive on the debaters' part. I'm following where the rounds are going, and expect to be led to the big arguments for either side, which I hope will somehow conflict with one another. In the average PF round I've seen, decisions boil down mostly to a couple of points, so if each team has three voters separate from the other side's voters, you're asking me to intervene. Pick the arguments you really want me to decide on. I also probably will go for arguments supported by evidence over analytics, if the two are in opposition.
