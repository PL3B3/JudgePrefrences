  My son is writing this philosophy so that should give you a pretty good idea with my experience with debate. Essentially I am a lay judge who doesn't want any spreading, theory, kritiks, etc. I can follow more esoteric arguments better than the standard parent judge as long as they have solid links to impacts. I don't like very weak links in arguments to something crazy like nuclear extinction. I want logical arguments and emotional pandering won't work on me like most parent judges.
