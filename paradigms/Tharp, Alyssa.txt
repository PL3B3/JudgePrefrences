  Qualified to judge: PFD, LD, Student Congress, International and Domestic Extemp
Background: competed in high-school debate at Vines and Plano Senior High, Fall 2005 - Spring 2008. Placed 2nd in "Ted Turner Public Forum Debate" at the National Speech and Debate Association (at the time National Forensic League) National Tournament, 2007. Multiple time TFA State Tournament qualifier and finalist in congress and extemp events.

I will flow all debates, and I expect clear communication and argumentation. As a simple example: If you are referencing a card from your affirmative in an offensive on your opponents argument, state more than "apply my X card" --- I want to hear specifically what it is about your evidence that makes it relevant, and your own analysis/argumentation about how this discredits your opponents case and/or makes your position more important.

Consistently showing how your contentions and rational arguments hold up your framework or value/criterion as the lens through which I should be weighing the round is obviously very important and fundamental to winning the debate.

The voting points offered in the final speech (if they stand true to my observation/flow of the round) are the basis for my voting decision.
