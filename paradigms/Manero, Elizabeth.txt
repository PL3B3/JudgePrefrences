  I'm in the class of 2020 at Harvard, and debated LD in high school all four years. I debated primarily on the CFL circuit in highschool - breaking to quarters my senior year - and got some exposure to the national circuit.

My paradigm is based on a number of points. While speed is fine for me, I don't like heavy spreading - your speed can range anywhere from super slow to light spreading but you shouldn't be gasping for breath every two seconds. I accept most arguments, with the exception of those at the extreme (genocide good). Speaker points will be awarded based on clarity, aptitude of CX, and organization of speeches. The framework debate will be heavily weighted, and the clearer your warrants are for each claim, the more likely I am to default to them when deciding a winner.

I am here to judge, not make arguments for you, os make sure to outline all of your arguments clearly, bookmark, show clash, and extend arguments for me. If you don't give warrants, extend arguments, or show impact, I won't do the work to weigh cards against your opponent for you.

I will accept progressive arguments, and at times prefer them, if they are well argued. Traditional frameworks are easy to follow but make sure that the value structure is well developed.
