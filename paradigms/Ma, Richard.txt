  Debated LD @ Interlake Highschool for 3 years.
Email me with questions: ma.richard304@gmail.com

I want debate to be as enjoyable and as educational as possible. I guess I do consider debate a "sacred" activity. 

Mostly larped as a debater. I will evaluate anything. I'm not as comfortable flowing tricks/blippy args.

Regarding theory, I will default no rvi, drop the arg, education/fairness are voters, reasonability, if no voters are read after standards.

I will yell "clear" if necessary. I will probably not make eye contact while flowing.

Ask before round for specific questions.

If you're spreading please share cases via flash drive or over email.

I don't disclose speaks.
