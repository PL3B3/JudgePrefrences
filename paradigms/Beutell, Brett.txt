  Namaste,

I'm Brett. I debated policy for four years at Eden Prairie High School in Minnesnowta from 2006-7 through 2009-10. Here's a brief description of my judging prejudices (we all have them).


I will listen to anything. In high school, I did some very crazy things as a debater that occasionally involved costumes. Take that as you will. 

I like performance and the K, but not at the expense of despising all things policy. However, if you are a policy minded debater up against some whacky K team, don't lose your cool. I interpret that as the first step towards defeat.

Counterplans are awesome.

I'm down with T debates; I lean aff on reasonability (if you argue it well).

I don't know many of the topic specific / politics DA specific acronyms you know. Please adapt accordingly. DA v. case debates should invariably have impact calculus, or else I feel like I'm intervening. Your speaker points might end up reflecting that.

Humor is much appreciated. If you're witty and funny, your speaker points will reflect that.

I understand cross-ex gets heated. But don't be an asshole. You don't need to be Sam Waterston, purveyor of justice, and ask your opponent 7 times, "WHERE IS THE LINE IN THIS CARD?! WHERE IS IT?! POINT TO IT!!!" I get the point.


I'll add more to this eventually.

Love,

Brett
