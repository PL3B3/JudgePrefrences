Rohit is a parent judge with 3 years experience in LD.

Presentation:* Prefer pacing that is moderate or slow. No spreading please, I like to hear and understand what was heard.
Voice modulation and eye contact are important for meOff time roadmaps are helpful and help me capture the arguments. Numbering of contentions is a blessing and help me capture and understand what you are trying to say.
Argumentation:* Tend to look at logic and structure of arguments more than evidence
Typically want to hear the credentials of the person that the evidence stems fromCX is important and how to attack and rebut attacks is a key part of the debate for me.
