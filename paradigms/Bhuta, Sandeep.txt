  Hello, I'm Sandeep Bhuta I debated for Gonzaga Prep in Spokane, Washington from 1998-2001, judged LD and Speech events for Gonzaga Prep, Seattle Prep, and Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences between 2001 and 2005, and am currently in my third year serving as debate coach for St. Ignatius College Prep.

Etiquette is supreme when I judge, so outbursts (or even whispered side conversations) from supporters in the audience or general rudeness will effect your speaks and potentially my decision on the round. I am okay with speed, but clarity is key. If I put my pen down and stop flowing, I'm having issues with your clarity and am in the process of mentally docking speaks. I have a low tolerance for spreading, so use your speed wisely.

I am open to most types of arguments, but be sure you know what you are doing, I want to hear clear and thorough analysis. Dense philosophical arguments tend to gain my attention much more than redefining the framework. Unique arguments are always welcome and I value appropriate use of evidence, but please refrain from counting cards or arguing recency of evidence. I'm pretty sick of all the abusive theory shells that rear their ugly heads at circuit tournaments, so if you plan on running theory, please strike me, or at bare minimum don't get too offended when I mark the ballot in favor of your opponent as soon as I hear your theory spew begin. If you have any further questions, please ask before the round! Best of luck.
