I'm a parent judge and have judged at debate tournaments before. I'm a very traditional judge that only wants to see traditional LD. Speed reading or excessive speed will not be tolerated. Sign posting is crucial and please link your values to your case. Remember this is "Value Debate"

Best of Luck to you!
