D/As- My fave argument. I like when a neg team has a uncommon dis-ad that is very specific to affs. I will listen to politics, but scenarios need to be explained (no cheating on internal links)
C/P- No bias. Totally open
Theory/ Topicality- make sure the flow is clean. Explain your arguments. and if you want togo for it make sure you go FOR IT!!

K- I only like amazing K debates. If you are not giving a coherent story on the K and are not applying it to the aff you will probably lose the round.

Have fun be nice and bring a timer
