Will vote on practically anything. Lit bias towards Kritiks but my higher expectations may actually disadvantage K teams in front of me. 

K: Explain the action of your alt, win the unique application of your link. 

DA: Most interested in the imp calc assuming uq. 

T: Win the standards debate. RVIs are fine, just explain them. 

CP: Competitiveness is important. PICs, etc test the plan but can be abusive. 

Non-policy affs: Defend ethics and method. 

Theory: Explain why it matters, my threshold is a tad higher here than other arguments. 

Aff: Solve your adv, o/w neg and win T. 

Oh! And I really dislike performative contradictions
