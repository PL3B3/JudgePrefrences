  Background: I debated for four years on the local and national circuits and attended NSD, but I have been out of the activity for about a year. 

Paradigm: I prefer a clear and concise value debate as opposed to spreading a bunch of evidence. If you don't see me flowing, I am not understanding what you are saying and I will not judge those arguments. I am not saying you can't talk fast, but be conscious of your enunciation and keep yourself at a reasonable pace. Try to focus more on impacting/linking your arguments than clarifying and explaining both yours and your opponent's arguments. Summary is the number one time waster debaters fall victim to.
