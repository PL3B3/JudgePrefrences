  I debated for 4 years at the Hockaday School in Dallas, TX and graduated in 2012. I now attend the University of Chicago. 

Be clear. The implications of important arguments should be reiterated multiple times. I can't stress this enough.

Other random things:
I will yell clear three times and then flow what I can after that. I default to reasonability on theory and drop the argument.Substance and strategy wise, I've realized that most of my preferences were just things I liked/did as a debater, but that as a judge I really don't care. Debate however you feel comfortable. Be nice. If you're offensive, expect low speaks.
