  I've been a debate judge for the last 3 years/debate seasons and have become more and more familiar with LD.

My philosophy is simply to listen to both sides and determine which arguments best win me over in each round, independently. I am in no way a professional at all of this and do not respond well to outlandish kritiks or things that appear extra-topical unless they are well formulated points with a clear outline.

Speed is not an issue, I can follow along BUT at the point that the argument suffers by being at an incomprehensible speed, I tend to follow along less and consider lessening your speaker points more. If the arguments require 500 words per minute spewing speed, perhaps it was not the most well thought through argument.

Come prepared with the physical evidence (or on a jump drive with YOUR OWN computer). If your evidence is put under question and you can not show it, I will have to assume something is faulty.

Impact in final speeches! It is not my fault if a little argument that could have won a round falls to the wayside: that's your responsibility as a debater to make it very clear to me.
