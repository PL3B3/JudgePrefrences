  I did not debate in high school or college. I started coaching about thirteen years ago and work mainly with extempers/congress/PF debaters. When I judge LD, I try not to intervene. I will flow the round to the best of my ability. If you decide to run policy arguments in LD, I expect you to be able to articulate the arguments in a way that I can understand (fairly direct explanations). I am open to the use of policy type arguments, but the debaters should know that I expect them to know how to debate policy positions. I will listen to theory debate and vote there if the flow dictates. In terms of speed/jargon/etc, please know that I do not judge a lot of LD over the course of the year. I will make it very clear when I am not flowing and am not able to keep up. Make sure you explain your arguments and try to make the decision easy for me.


Thank you!
