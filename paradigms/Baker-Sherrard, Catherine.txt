  I am the parent of a debater from Walt Whitman High School, Bethesda, Maryland. I have served as a judge, primarily at local tournaments. I will flow the round, looking to see how your contentions or turns support your value criterion (and/or the value criterion of your opponent). I cannot process the speed at which national debaters present their cases, so please speak at lay judge pace if you want me to follow your arguments. It can help you to crystalize the round and present voters. I do not have experience judging theory debate or critical argumentation. Therefore, I would prefer to hear arguments directly related to the topic. Thank you for this opportunity to hear you debate; I will do my best to be a responsible and fair judge.
