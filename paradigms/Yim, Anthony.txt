Value and criteria are necessary for me as an LD judge. I think it is key that the value is upheld within the contentions in the case, and the criteria's link to the value premise is very important and should be explained clearly within the initial constructive for both sides.
Evidence adds credibility to any argument, and it has been my experience that too many debaters tend to make great-sounding assertions, especially in regard to human behavior, that would be much more powerful if it contained evidence.
I make every effort to not mentally intervene in the round: I like line-by-line argumentation if it is delivered at a moderate pace. Clash and clarity are very important.
In rebuttals, I do prefer the "key voter" approach, and tend to prefer examples and reasoning that is key to the topic over philosophical argumentation.
I would like to add that I will also vote on post modern philosophy concepts and if you spread there needs to be a specific reason behind it. On that note, I’m not a big fan of narratives, however if it is prudent in its framework…I’ll vote on that as well.
