I was a policy debater in high school and college. I have coached debate for over 30 years.

I am not a fan of truth testing but I have voted for it. Feel free to run theory or critical arguments - with a few warnings. If you are running multiple prestandards arguments - I am confused as to how I am supposed to evaluate them. How can 5 different arguments be evaluated first? I expect to hear an alternative to your K. Feel free to ask specific questions about your strategy before the round. I don't have any particular objection to speed, but if you want me to get all your arguments, you should know that I haven't flowed much speed in the last few years.
