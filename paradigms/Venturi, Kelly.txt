  I competed in Lincoln Douglas throughout high school so I am well versed in philosophy and the set up of the event. With this, I emphasize the value and criterion debate. I believe points need to be clear and supported, but debaters must also relate these back to whatever they set at the value/criterion level. I understand theory, K’s, etc. but do not think they’re the best tools to use in a round so I prefer if they’re avoided when possible. I can understand speaking quickly/spreading as long as it is clear.
