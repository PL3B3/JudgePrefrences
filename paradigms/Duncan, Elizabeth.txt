  I believe that debate is a communications activity, and I value slow, clear, persuasive appeals to logic. I will vote for the debater who makes the most sense in the round, so make a cogent argument. I don't care about value/criterion structure, and I don't like burdens. I most often vote for the person in whose world I'd rather live at the end of the day. One thing I won't tolerate is rudeness, so be polite.
