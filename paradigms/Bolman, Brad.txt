Do what you are best at. I try to leave predispositions out of decision-making as much as possible (it's not) and will work hard to adjudicate your round well. It's not my job to decide what you should debate, but to help you become better at how you choose to debate.

If I'm typing during cross-x, 99% of the time I'm writing comments about your debate.

Extraneous bio:

I debated at Harvard with Michael Suo. We won some debates. I taught at the UTNIF and Wake this summer, so I have a sense of the topic but I'm not following too closely.
