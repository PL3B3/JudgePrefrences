Debated at Bellaire High School and University of North Texas



Topicality- Probably default to competing interpretations

Politics- Favorite arg will err on offense/defense

Counterplan- Prob err neg on theory unless its condo. counterplan has to be competitive 

Kritik/Performance- Not well read on most lit but most likely default on offense/defense

Theory- Not a huge fan of theory debates but will vote on it as any other argument

Pretty big believer in debate ethos e.g. no clipping cards/preptime stealing/etc.

Viewing Laptop Ethos- I won’t take prep when flashing evidence on a viewing computer but that also means you won’t prep during the transfer or else I will take the prep out of your time. 2nd- Don’t steal evidence unless you should be posting cites on caselist.

I Believe in minimal judge intervention- wont call up ev unless debate is perceptively close
