  I am old school.

Things I Iike:
Values and criterions
Clash
Discussion of the resolution
Civil discourse
Sharp dress
Clear voters


Things I dislike:
Spreading
Lack of clash
Debates that have very little or nothing to do with the resolution,
Rudeness
Unkemptness
Muddled voters

I try hard to leave biases out of the round and will vote based on the arguments that you make.

As a disclaimer, I competed in speech in high school, but I have been coaching LD (among other things) for the past six years so I am very comfortable with the category.
