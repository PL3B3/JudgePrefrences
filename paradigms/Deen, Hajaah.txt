  
I have been judging Congress but I am now judging Public Forum since my sons have become interested in this.

I will do my best to follow you, but cannot handle speedy debate. Please keep your jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy.
Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
