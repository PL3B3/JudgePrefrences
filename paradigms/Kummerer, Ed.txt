  I am relatively old-school. I've been more or less removed from the circuit for the better part of four years, for whatever that's worth.

I am probably below-average at dealing with speed, and will probably process your arguments better if you deliver them at a manageable pace. If you read a value and criterion, your arguments had better impact back to that criterion. I love good voting issues (ones that actually give me a reason why the resolution has been proved true/false) and loathe bad ones (don't tell me that your fir st voting issue is that you won the value debate).

I believe evidence is useful as a supplement to sound argumentation, but rarely view it as necessary (unless you are making a factual claim). I am thoroughly unimpressed by cases that are 90% card text and 10% your own argumentation.
