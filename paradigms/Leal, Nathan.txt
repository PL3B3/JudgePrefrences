  Competed 2 years in Collegiate Lincoln Douglas in Texas. Now coach both Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas. Acquired 2014 Public Forum State Championship in 2014. I am familiar and fine with circuit debate but will prefer to limit spreading in round. 
Theory: I'm fine with both theory and procedural debate but will not do any work for you in the debate round. I will base it entirely off of the flow so please make any kicks or extensions that you feel necessary as I will not be doing it for you.
K: I will buy into your K only if you prove to me that it extends beyond the round. You will not be able to kick out of the K if you decide to run it.
Plans/counterplans: fine as long as you meet the requirements of a plan text.
