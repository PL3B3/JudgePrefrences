  Judging Philosophy (LD)

In LD I have no specific voting issues, rather I evaluate the debate that occurs is the round. As a general rule I look for a good standards debate and strong clash. I am not a fan of spreading in debate and will mark down speaker points if a speaker goes to fast to effectively communicate their argument.
