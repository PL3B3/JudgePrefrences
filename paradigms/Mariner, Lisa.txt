Speed--I prefer speakers to slow down enough to enunciate. If I cannot understand you, I will give the win to the other team.
Jargon--is fine.
Topicality--If you can prove that a team is off topic, I will give you the win.
Counterplans--are good if justified by credible sources.
Critiques--formal critiques within the speeches are good, but should be avoided during the CX.
