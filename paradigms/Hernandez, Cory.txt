  I debated for 3 years in high school. I mostly did PFD but also did LD and another type of debate, the name of which is escaping me (it was a one-time thing this one school did). I also did Student Congress. I did a year of parliamentary debate in undergrad. Now I'm a 1L at Berkeley Law. Previously I've judged parliamentary, LD, Student Congress, PFD, and Policy debate rounds, at high school and collegiate levels.
