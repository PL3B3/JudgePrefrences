  I debated four years of Lincoln Douglas while in high school at Cathedral Prep in Erie, Pa. I graduated in 2008 and now attend Case Western Reserve University.

I feel LD should be about the logic in the arguments rather than the debater’s ability to eloquently phrase things. I want organized debates with good signposting. I’m fine with speed, as long as the debater is capable a speaking fast and remaining comprehensible. If a debater makes philosophy a main part of his argument, he must demonstrate a good understanding of that philosophy.

Each debater should provide a value and criterion. I do not want to make any assumptions as a judge – the debaters must show the warrants and impacts for everything, extend the arguments, and finish the round with their voting issues.
