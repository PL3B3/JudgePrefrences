   Topicality: I am not well versed on the topic yet so but I do enjoy a good T debate, so I will be willing to vote on T just dont expect me to understand the intricacies of the topic without you explaining them to me

Counterplans: PICS, adv. cp's, all great - love a good pic debate. Not a huge fan of consult but will listen to anything

Kritiks: will listen and vote on them - just debate them well

Theory - love a good theory debate, if debated well i will vote on it

I'm pretty laid back, really willing to let you do whatever you want, just make sure whatever you do you debate it well and have fun
