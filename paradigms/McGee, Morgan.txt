  Hi everyone my name is Morgan McGee. Pronouns are she/ her, experience is mainly college debate in NFA-LD. I am a freshman at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln and majoring in Russian and Global studies and also pursuing a path that will lead me to law school. With that said lets get to the nitty gritty.

When it comes to debate I will listen to the value criterion debate in order to learn what framework I will use to evaluate rounds. That being said contentions of either side can prove the value that wins. Winning the value debate does not win you the round. You can concede the value debate if you can prove why your contentions better address that framework. That being said, turns can really help on the substance. If you can prove why their contentions don't address the framework it will really help. 

If you have any questions please feel free to ask and I hope to see y'all do great!
