  Some background: I debated policy debate at Saint Francis High School for three years (alternative energy, social services, and military presence). I did both league and circuit debating but my flow is definitely not as good as it was back then - you'll probably have to slow down for me. 

Read whatever arguments you want. I have been in and seen more rounds with critical or policy arguments rather than performative ones though so keep that in mind. 

Whatever you go for, tell me the story. Don't make me compare your impacts for you. Don't just read your blocks; clash is good and so is showing you are comfortable with what you're talking about. 

Paperless: Prep stops when the USB leaves the port. I won't count passing the USB or opening the file as prep but anything more than that and I'll start deducting. If you're going to read something different than what's highlighted, make that clear to everyone.
