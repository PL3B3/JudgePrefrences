I debated for 4 years in LD at Lynbrook High School in California and graduated in 2017. The majority of my debates during high school revolved around theory util and kritiks but that doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t be effective at evaluating other types of debates, Iâ€™ll just have less background knowledge and experience resolving them so youâ€™ll have to do more explanation. Please weigh and impact arguments that'll make the round so much easier for me to make a decision. I donâ€™t know what type of judge I am but I am open to voting on p much any argument as long as it has a warrant that I can articulate in the rfd and explain the function of the argument in the round. This mean go for all your nontopical k affs, frivoulous theory and tricks but you still have to win them like any other argument. I default drop the debater, competing interps and no rvi but that's only if no other argument is made on either side. I still am figuring out speaker points but I tend reward people for being entertaining and creative with their strategies as well as for good execution and clarity of strategic vision in the round. Most importantly just have fun. I enjoyed debate a lot when I did it and hopefully you do too ðŸ™‚
