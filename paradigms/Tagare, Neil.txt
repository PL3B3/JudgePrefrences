  I’m a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I debated LD for Bellarmine all four years and competed heavily at local tournaments and state tournaments. I also competed on the national circuit for three years.

Theory: Please try to avoid it but if there is clear abuse make sure your theory arguments are clear. Also, I think NR responses to 1AR Spike extensions are totally fine.

K’s: I’ll understand most commonly read K’s (Cap, Fem, etc..) as long as you explain the cards in your own words as you go along.

Framework: I like util but understand other frameworks.

Plans/Counterplans/DA’s: Love them! Run them – this is probably what I’m best at evaluating.

Topicality: I don’t believe that the aff can run topicality against the neg. Neg has a right to be extra topical. That being said, if you’re not being topical, I think it’ll be abundantly clear.

Speaks: I generally give 28-30. If you’re rude expect a 26-27.

Speed: Speed is fine. Slow down on tag names and warrants.

Extensions: I want full extensions: Claim, warrant, impact in every speech.

Defaults (feel free to make arguments otherwise):
Theory > K
Status Quo on the neg

Conclusion: Be nice, be clear, and make sure you crystallize and weigh a lot in order to get my ballot. I will vote for arguments (good or bad) your opponent concedes only if you tell me why they are important.
