I debated 3 years high school debate a long time ago and have been an active judge for the past ten years. I have embraced the newer styles of argumentation and miss the "old school" format of debates.

I have judged about 20 rounds on this topic and I am a freight transportation professional, so I feel that I have a solid background on this years high school topic. 

Alot of the preferences that would be of interest are good matters for you to debate during the round. I would like to say that I have evaluated and voted on most arguments. I want the debaters to tell me why something should be valued higher than the opponent.

At a high level:

T- Love it, think good T debates are some of the higher quality debates in the activity. I think T debates can separate good teams from each other.

Topical Aff's - Love it.

Case Debate: Solid case debate probably is the gateway to high speaks with me.

Non-topical affs- Can become interesting debates and have become a part of college debate. I pref topicality probably over all.

The K- I understand and vote on the K more than I thought I would. I have worked pretty hard on understanding critcal theory and argumentation but I am not a master in philosophy or don't have any desire to complete my golf foursome with Heidegger, Nietzche or Malthus. I really want to understand the alt and have a clear picture of the scenario. The link story has to be good.

CP's- I like them but find myself preffing aff on issues of competitiveness. I think this year's high school topic has some interesting counterplanning opportunities but I think states are still a problematic actor.

Have fun, run what you are good at and defend what you do.

Any questions just ask.
