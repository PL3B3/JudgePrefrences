  I have been a parent judge for 4 years in LD.

I am traditional judge although I don’t mind speed as long as it is clear. I judge local tournaments and have participated at Princeton and Harvard. I consider it your responsibility to make sure that your argument is easy to flow and not my responsibility to figure out your argument. I am open to theory, but again it is your responsibility to show how it works. I put emphasis on crystallization and voting issues and consider it a sign of a good debater that they are able to make draw a clear distinction between your arguments and your opponents and why I should make a decision in your favor. This means that your contentions should be supported with warrants and tie into your framework and also show how it links into your opponent’s framework.
