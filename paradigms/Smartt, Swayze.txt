  Swayze SmarttAffiliation: Wake ForestConflicts: St. Mark's I'm open to any arguments you want to read, but default to a policymaking framework and an offense/defense paradigm of evaluating debate. At St. Mark's I ran almost strictly policy arguments and am not that familiar with "critical" literature. I'm also generally persuaded by arguments that affirmatives must be topical, but can be convinced otherwise. Any other questions feel free to ask.
