  Hello all! My name is Taylor Yocom, I debated national and local circuit LD at Des Moines Roosevelt from 2007-11 and I did college policy at the University of Iowa for my first two years of college. I also taught at the university's LD camp for summer 2012. I judge only 1-2x a year now due to my schedule. I'm okay with speed as long as you are clear, I don't like voting on theory, but I'll vote on almost anything if it's crystallized clearly in the 2n/2a. Feel free to ask questions, thanks, and have fun!
