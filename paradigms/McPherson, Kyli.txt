  I debated in High school. My main events were PF and Impromptu, although I did debate in LD my Junior year. I haven't debated for several years, so dumb things down for me if you want me to follow you.
My paradigm is pretty simple. I prefer clear concise arguments with an impact on real life. With regards to framework, the one that has been proven the best throughout the round is the one I will use. If neither side brings up a framework, or if the framework debate is dropped, I will revert to a cost-benefit analysis. Spreading doesn't bother me overly much, so long as you speak clearly and emphasize taglines. That being said, it isn't my favorite thing in the world. Clash is important, because without it I don't really see any point in debate, but you need to be civil about it. I have voted teams down on being overly antagonistic, although that was an extreme case. Overall, I love a good debate, but I am rusty, So treat me like a mommy judge and you'll be fine.
