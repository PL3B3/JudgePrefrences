  I am a judge for Catalina Foothills High School in Tucson, Arizona. I am a parent of a team member and a professional in the community. I have never competed in any forensics activity but have about a year of judging experience with the CHFS team having judged many rounds at several tournaments. I cannot understand very rapid delivery and place a large emphasis on clear persuasive communication. Debate rounds should be conducted politely and professionally especially during the cross examination times. I will not flow the cross examination and expect any gains made during that time to be brought up in speech time in order to be evaluated. I believe the burden of the affirmative is to prove the resolution true and the negative needs only to prove the resolution false in order to win a round, I will accept critical negative arguments. It would be very hard for me to vote for a debater who does not win the framework debate. I will vote on the worldview presented most successfully so long as it is backed up by winning the framework. I will vote on the key voting issues presented by debaters as the most important in summary speeches. I do not have a complete understanding of all debate jargon and ask that it is kept to a minimum. I feel that analytical evidence is key to warranting case arguments but I will accept strong logical connections and empirical evidence as foundations of continuing debate.
