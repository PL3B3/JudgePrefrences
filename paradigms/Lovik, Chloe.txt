  Update for Berkeley:

Hello! My name is Chloe Lovik. I debated for/ graduated from Cottonwood High in 2013 and debated parli at the University of Utah. 

This is my first time judging LD but I am familiar with many of the policy concepts (Plans, DAs, CPs and Ks sorta stuff) used in LD. I would just slow down a lot for really dense philosophical frameworks or tech (theory etc.) heavy arguments. 

I will not vote for explicitly sexist, racist or homophobic argument (or anything you might have to think twice about reading)

Ask me any questions you have before the round.
Good luck and have fun!

Also I lived with my best friend Monica Amestoy for a year so I guess you can say that shaped my view of debate. Here is a link to her paradigm
