Lincoln Douglas Debate Judge Philosophy
I am currently a high school coach with a small LD squad. Our team competes primarily in PF, but I have judged LD with frequency in the 4 years I have coached my team.
I have judged LD rounds this year at local tournaments and at the Nova High Titian Tournament and the University of Florida Blue Key Tournament.
My preferred rate of delivery is moderate speed because I judge based upon the V and VC but with strong consideration of the argument contentions therein. I can take speed if the speaker is clear, but I will only consider what I understand. The same can be said of adequately warranting contentions. I feel it is the obligation of each debater to build a clear and understandable case rather than expecting the judge to figure it out.
Criterion is important to my decision since it is the distinguishing characteristic of Lincoln-Douglas debate, but the argument points must fit the selected criterion and the criterion should be the overarching goal of the argument points.
I am fine with voting issues at any point, but I believe they work best in the final speech.
I am also fine with commonly used debate jargon when it is used correctly and not used as a filler.
I believe that final rebuttals should include both line by line analysis and voting issues.
I decide the winner of the round on the basis of best and most arguments within the established criteria. So, while it is unlikely that a case will win if the value or value criterion is proved invalid, that alone would not rule out a win if the arguments are superior to those of the opposition. Arguments must be carried across the flow to stand and refutation must be handled in a timely manner throughout the round or it will be a concession to the opponent. I consider both analytical and empirical evidence in the round.
When I judge a round, I flow in order to reach a decision and award the win as noted above.
