  Only those that follow the eightfold path to enlightenment can learn the true meaning of the ballot. 

For those who have not followed the eightfold path, here is a quick summary: 
I did Congress/Extemp/PF for four years at Kerr HS, and taught at Harvard Debate Council’s Summer Workshops this year. 

I’ll evaluate pretty much any argument, as long as it’s well-warranted and not abusive. Framework is key, and it needs to be clear, well-warranted and well-argued for weighing at the end. If you want me to extend your argument, then respond to the opponent’s attacks on it. Same stands for final focus; extend properly for me to vote based on them. Concrete weighing on impacts and arguments is wonderful. Avoid spreading, but I have no problem with fast-paced clear speaking. Emphasis on clear. Speaker points are allocated based on how effective you are in the round, especially on presentation and argument efficiency. 

Feel free to ask me questions you may have before the round.
