  I am a traditional stock issues judge unless another paradigm has been successfully introduced into the round.

I have been an Urban Debate high school coach for 3 years (as of 2012) and coached in the NFL for 10 years in Colorado. I was a high school debater.

I don't like EXCESSIVE speed.
I don't like final rebuttals that don't tell me how to vote.
I don't like cards that are overtagged.
