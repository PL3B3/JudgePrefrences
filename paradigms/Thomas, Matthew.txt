Background: I debated LD for four years for Monticello HS with decent regional and national experience. I graduated in 2009 and am currently a student at Boston College. I judged 60+ rounds in 2009-10 predominantly at Northeast bid tournaments.

I will vote on anything. However, absent an alternate framework mechanism, I default to value/standards analysis. If you plan on running arguments with a different type of framework, explain what the framework is, how that framework functions, and why it is preferable. Assume I know very little about it but am intelligent enough to understand a brief explanation.

Speed: You can speak as fast as you wish. You must be clear or I will inevitably miss the nuances of your argument (or the arguments themselves).
Speaks: Based on quality of argumentation/strategy. Caveat: if you are mean/disrespectful to your opponent, expect your speaks to suffer.

If you have questions, comments, or disagreements, ask. Feel free to ask/question/disagree with my decision. It wonâ€™t change the outcome of the round but it will help me (and maybe you) in the future.

Most importantly, have fun. Debate is way too competitive at times and taken way too seriously. Enjoy the round, the tournament, the weekend. Learn something.
