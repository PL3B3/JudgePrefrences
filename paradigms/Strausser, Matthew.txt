  I debated LD in high school from 2001-2005. I have not done any debate since graduating high school.

The winner of the debates I judge is likely to be persuasive, clear, and convincing. 

Use debate terminology at your own risk.Debate has evolved a great deal in the last ten years; if you use a term, a concept, or shorthand that was not around in the early 2000's or that I do not remember from the aforementioned glory days, you may be disappointed in my ability to follow your case/rebuttal. That being said, do not shy away from concepts or feel the need to "dumb down" your argument, rather show proficiency in clearly defining and explaining your message.Solely using jargon to rebut am argument will get you no where. Convince me.Be clear. Feel free to use a bit of speed if you have a lot to explain, but never sacrifice clarity even a little bit.Be polite. Feel free to be informal, but you must be polite. Answer questions in CX, keep your own prep time accurately, be friendly.Remember this is value-based debate. Debate values, debate the resolution, debate each other. Engaging the values, the resolution, and the opponent will be more effective than anything else.
