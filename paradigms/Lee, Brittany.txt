  I am the co-director of Rise Up Rebuild in DC and I have judged policy debate in the Baltimore and DC Urban Debate Leagues as well as BCFL for the past two years. I'm open to all different forms of debate. I've Judged 6 rounds on this year's topic. I have a strong connection to this year's resolution and love to hear passionate/validated arguments.

For me, it is important to connect to the topic through your evidence. Debaters should be well organized and prepared; screaming over your opponent or avoiding the question will result in low speaker points. A fruitful debate should be a civil exchange of ideas.
