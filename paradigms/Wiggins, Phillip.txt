  I debated for four years at Strake Jesuit, so I understand the basics of debate and debate theory. However, I have not judged or participated in the activity since leaving Strake, so my judging philosophy will naturally be less technical than others'. I expect to see thorough argumentation - complete with proper claims, warrants and impacts to the value/value standard. Moreover, I will appreciate clarity and coherent discussion. I can flow; but I may not be able to keep up with a rapid spread.
