Hi, I'm Spencer. I was a 2N in policy for most of my debates in high school. I went to Chaminade College Prep in Los Angeles.
General Stuff:

- You do you. I'd rather judge a debate where you're comfortable with your arguments than if you're trying to conform to my preferences.

- Speed is fine, slow down on tags and author.

- Don't be oppressive - sexism, racism, homophobia, any general rudeness doesn't have a place in the round.

- Critiques are fine, but explain your alt and how it resolves the impacts. I'm not too familiar with the proliferation of postmodern literature so if you're into it, be clear and simplify your arguments.

- K affs are cool, but I think they should probably be in the direction of the topic. Fair disclosure: I almost exclusively went for FW against non-traditional affirmatives, but I definitely see their value in debate. I'd prefer if these two flows actually interacted and there is an explanation of how one resolves or precedes the other.
