  I am the father of a first year debater at Brighton High School and work in the Brewers field.


I prefer a traditional debate and wish for the debaters to speak slowly and clearly. I am open to nearly any type of argument as long as it easily makes sense and contributes positively to the debate round. I will do my best as a judge. I will judge fairly and vote for the side of which I think clearly wins the round.


I enjoy watching and judging debates and think the topics are always interesting. I did not grow up debating however have taken great interest in the debate community through my son and his team.


I am looking forward to judging all debaters and wish you luck throughout your debate career.
