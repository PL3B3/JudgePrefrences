  I debated policy for 3 years in high school. I coached policy debate for 2 years at Alta high school. I try to be as objective as possible. I will vote for the team who's voters convince me the most. Framework debate often makes my job easier, if debated well. I try not to have a bias for specific kinds of arguments. I will vote on anything you tell me to vote on as long as the reasons for which you tell me to vote are better than the other teams.

Organization is key. If you have a messy round, it is quite likely that I will miss a few key arguments from both sides. If you want to convince me that you are right, make sure your argument isn't all over the place. Also talk about specific authors and pieces of evidence in the last 2 speeches. Telling the story is good, but you need authors to back up your story. If I know what evidence verifies specific parts of your argument I will be able to look at them after the round and make a better decision. I can keep up with speed, but to a certain limit. If you are a fast spewer, just make sure to be super clear when you read the taglines, authors, and dates.
