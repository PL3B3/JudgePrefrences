 Tabula Rasa
 
I am a Tab judge. If you provide clear framework for evaluating the round and establish early what the role of the ballot should be I will vote there. Strong preference for heavy offense.

Perms are tests of competitiveness, not necessarily mutual exclusivity.

Kritiks should have good specific link and uniqueness evidence and an explicit alternative.

Counterplans should have status clarified early and be presented in the 1NC
Counterplans that link into neg. kritiks are bad unless you present multiple world theory that I can buy.

Topicality is a good test that can weaken my view of the opposing team but don't expect me to vote on T alone.

Not terribly familiar with performance, but also not opposed to it. 

As long as both teams engage in meaningful debate and tell me clearly where to vote, I will be pleased. My decision is ultimately made for the team that shows me why I should vote for them.
