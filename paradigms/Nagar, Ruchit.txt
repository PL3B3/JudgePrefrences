My name Is Ruchit and I debated for Kinkaid High School in Houston, TX for 4 years in LD.I have experience with a variety of styles from the local to national level and have had success at various tournaments across that range as well. Enough about me, here is what to expect from me as a judge:

speed is fine as long as you are clearif you are not clear, then just stop trying; if you slow down maybe you will be able to better articulate your argumentsi well give you a death stare and stop flowing if you are totally incomprehensible and if you don't get the point I might whistlequality matters more than quantitymake as many arguments as you like, but make sure they are complete arguments with claim, warrant, evidence, impact, link and logical connection to some overall thesis;make specific arguments that are clearly labeled, so it's easier to followi think good debates involve good clash rather than just extensions of dropped arguments on both sidesthere needs to be a substantial amount of comparison; don't make a bunch of arguments (as clever or hard to answer in volume as they may be) without explaining how they function both in your scheme of arguments but also how they interact with your opponents arguments. you can still talk about a lot with few arguments if you make good connections and comparisonsI will vote based on the weighing analysis that both sides provide me; make it very clear what issues you believe are the strongest reasons why you deserve the ballot, so that I don't have to go digging for them or arranging my own hierarchy based on work you failed to doI am ok with any flavor of argument: kritik, policyesque arguments, nontopical arguments. just make sure you are explaining the relevance of your arguments and not spewing big words that will fly over everyone's head because they are so lacking in substance and meaning. i would prefer to come out of the round learning something in addition to judging youyou will get good speaker points ifyou are able to engage in a substantive debateyou are economical with your word choice but still able to have a deep and meaningful debateyou are funnyyou make your opponent look silly in CXyou ask strategic questions in CX and build off those concessions in the rebuttalsyour arguments are creative!!!!!!!!!!!! (i hate generic boring arguments!!!!) and still make sense!!!!your rebuttals are not a resummary of your case, but rather an adept analysis and reworking of your arguments acknowledging the context of the other debater's pointsyou do a good job weighing and explaining functions of arguments from start to stopyour final rebuttals finish with some sort of overview of what you think is important for the ballotWarnings. please avoid the following:incomprehensible speedpointless theory debatesreally, if you engage in a theory debate full on and I think it's absolutely unnecessary and that you could have substantively handled the debate, you will be severely penalized in speaker points for initiating pointless nonsensei have a high threshold for good theory debate, so you probably won't meet it, so just don't do itabusive arguments (you can be strategic, but not abusive)definition debates (pick something that has a solid grounding in the topic literature and actually talk about the issues)generic framework debates (boring, I want to learn about the resolution)remember, debate is more than just a game. you need to be having fun and learning at the same time. keep that in mind and make your attitude reflects that in round.
