Policy
Case Debate
I love a good case debate.
Aff- use your 1ac throughout the round. You should of put a lot of work into it so use it! Extend it throughout the round not just in your last speech.
Neg- I will buy plan is worse than the status quo if the neg can prove it.
T
I am fine with T. Neg show me what you lose by the aff running the certain aff. If you want to win on t, go all in and don’t just extend your argument go deeper into the details of the standards.

Da
I also love to see good disads. My favorite is politics but don’t run it just because I said that. If you run a disad do good impact calculus!
Cp
Counterplans are a great strategy for the neg. I am fine with theory as well but you can’t just read the block you have to really paint the picture of what you are losing by the neg running the cp. Pics are great.
K
I am familiar with most of the generic kritiks. Make sure to not only tell me why your framework is good but why it is better than the other team's framework.
Overall
I am open to new arguments. Don’t change your overall strategy for me. Debate your strengths. Even-if statements are great, use them. No new args in the last speeches and tell me where the round came down to and what I should vote on in the last speeches. Clarity is also good. I love a good cross ex but make sure you bring what was said in cx into the debate through one of your speeches. Be nice and act like you want to be debating even if it is your last round. Any questions feel free to ask.

LD
Most of my background is in policy therefore I like progressive debates. In the last speeches make sure to tell me what I should vote on. Look at the round as a big picture and show me where you won.
