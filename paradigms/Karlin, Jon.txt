  Who am I? I qualified for the TOC back in 2006-2007, coached a national circuit debate team from 2007-2009 and finished my schooling in London. 

For the purposes of your pref sheet:
- I am non-ideological about debate because I filter in and out. 
- If you perform/don't defend the resolution- I am not the best judge for you. I have voted for these positions and if this is what you do, do what you gotta do.
- I am very good for specific K teams 
- I am 'okay' for generic K teams
- I am very good for teams that impact turn generic k's and teams that love impact turn debates
- I am persuaded by limits arguments on topicality- specifically the need for predictable limits- ground is inevitable under any interpretation 
- I think there is a legitimate argument for why 50 state fiat is bad and the states cp- people need to develop this argument more coherently 
- I am very good for fast technical policy teams
- The advent of paperless has destroyed alot of nuance and tech that I used to enjoy in debate. You still need to flow and please for the love of god stick to the line-by-line. People have lost the technical suave and swagger with the usage of paperless- this needs to change.
