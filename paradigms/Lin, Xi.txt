Desert Vista High Class of 09
2009 TOC and National Qualifier

Speed: Speed is fine, just make sure you are clear. If you are unclear, I will say clear in round, but only once. Speaks will be compromised if you remain unclear.

Theory: Theory is fine, clearly state interpretation and violation and why I should vote on theory and why it be evaluated before other types of argumentation.

Critical args: If you choose to run complex/obscure argumentation, its in your best interest to slow down so I can get what you're saying. If I don't understand it the first time i flow it, it will not be voted for.

Evaluation: I will try not to hold any predispositions toward any arguments, just warrant everything you say.

Speaks: judged by eloquence/coherence/dominating CXs/HUMOR

Other: Default framework is policy-making

Feel free to ask me any other questions before the round.
