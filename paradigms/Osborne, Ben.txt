  No real judging "philosophy" to speak of. I do have a few likes and dislikes that might help you debate in front of me.
Likes:
Clarity
Speed within your skill level (If you cant go fast and use it productively, then dont go fast)
Case, counterplan, and disad debate for policy, and more "traditional" debate for LD

Dislikes:
Overly complicated kritiks (I will vote for K's but I want them to make sense)
Rudeness

Most importantly, enjoy yourself and get some education out of this activity.
