        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        Clear ones supported by authority.

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Make sense.

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Did not clearly state position and argument out of the chute.

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        Lemmon v. Box exception to the Statute of Frauds.

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        Ones unsupported by authority.

        Other things a team should know about?

        Be respectful, but not bashful. Judges rarely know as much as you do. Teach them.
