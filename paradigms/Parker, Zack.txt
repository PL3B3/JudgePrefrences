I debated for Glenbrook North for 4 years, almost exclusively in policy. I default to offense/defense on topicality, and just about every other issue (like DAs), unless told otherwise by debater(s). I have no bias toward/against offense/defense when and if it's challenged. If I'm judging you in LD, it's probably best to read policy-style arguments. This isn't necessarily because I prefer those arguments to whatever else you might read, it's that I'm more familiar with them. That is to say, I'm likelier to vote for the side that's presented arguments that I understand the best. That means that LD-style arguments are definitely winnable in front of me - as long as you explain them sufficiently. 

If you want my opinions on other issues, go look at the judging philosophies of Ari Parker and Alex Pappas.
