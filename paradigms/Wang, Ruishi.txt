  I am a very traditional and considered "old school" style LD debate judge. I debated on Houston UIL/TFA circuit between 2001-2005. I believe Lincoln Douglas debate has changed significantly in the past 10 years, and not necessarily in a positive way. LD should be a slower pace debate and not a 1vs1 CX format.

I believe LD should be a debate that focuses on argumentation in terms of the framework (value and criterion). There should be significant analysis and argumentation placed on all contentions and subpoints. The role of LD debate is to effectively communicate to any type of judge (whether flow or lay) a true analysis of the resolution.
