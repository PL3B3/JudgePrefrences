  Can't judge: Randolph (NJ)

I debated Lincoln-Douglas debate at Randolph High School (NJ) from 2012-2016 and was Captain of LD. I competed both locally and nationally in the Northeast. I'm not consistently in the activity anymore, so don't read too fast. When I did debate, I ran K arguments because I was a big fan of them, but don't let that limit what you run. I probably am not best at eval'ing theory because I ran into that much less often, so be kind. Run anything you want though, and as long as it's not racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. I'm open to listening.
