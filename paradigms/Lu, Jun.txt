  I am a parent judge, have judged LD in local tournaments for about two years and a few national circuit tournaments. I prefer traditional debate and no spreading. Debate with logic, back up your contentions with solid evidences, and slow down when stating important arguments/points and evidences. I would appreciate a good summary in NR and 2AR. Please be respectful and civil.
