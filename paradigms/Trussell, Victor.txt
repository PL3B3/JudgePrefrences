Hey everyone, as you can see I'm from Wisconsin. We rarely utilize certain arguments that are commonly seen on the national level. However, I do have a background in policy debate. I have no problem with CP, Kritiks, DA's, etc but I will not listen to speed so slow down. LD in Wisconsin is at conversational speed typically. If I have a blank stare on my face that probably means I'm not flowing you.
