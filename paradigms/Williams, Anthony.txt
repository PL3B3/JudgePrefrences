  My name is Anthony Williams.

I debated HS CCX in the early 2000's. I'm a tabula rasa judge with a few points of emphasis or bias.

- Your job is to tell me a story of ABC leading to XYZ. If you leave it to me to connect the dots, do not be upset with how I decide to vote.
- I will vote on T, especially if abuse is shown
- Reading a shell is not debating... neither is requesting that I extend badly articulated or spread information across my flow (when I didn't get it on the first place)
- I'm cool with spreading... but reading monotoned just to increase speed decreases my chances of catching the warrants of the cards. Please be aware of your audience and not self absorbed with your talent.

That's about it.
