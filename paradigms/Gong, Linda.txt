  Background: 4 years of policy debate for Interlake High School
Other things:
- Affs: All affs are fine.
- Framework: I will listen to it.
- Will not give you the thesis of your kritik for granted. Will reward knowledge and coherent explanation. Buzzwords are not warrants.
- You'll get extra speaker points if you make jokes about Sabrina Bajwa, math or abolishing marriage. If you pull out a whiteboard midround to do a proof, you might lose, but I'll give you a 30. 
- If you win, I'll vote for you. However, I am predisposed towards arguments that make sense. This means I personally dislike pomo bullshit and the politics disad.
