  I am coaching James Logan High School in Union City, California. As a student at James Logan, I competed in LD for four years and I spent two of those four years competing on the circuit.

My paradigm is pretty simple. When evaluating a round, I look to see which debater has won her framework and then evaluate the impacts to that framework. I don't have many preferences in terms of which arguments I like to see in frameworks or anything of that nature. You are free to run whatever you want as long as (a) you can adequately justify it and (b) I can understand the argument. Speaking of understanding, I am fine with speed but I don't consider myself to be the best flower. So, if you're going to go fast make sure to take that into account.

I am not opposed to any form of argumentation. However, I do believe that the more complicated an author/argument gets, the more time you ought spend on explaining it. Ultimately, what that means is that I don't like to see people purposely spreading complicated arguments just to gain an advantage. If that's confusing, ask me to elaborate on that before the round.

Don't be a dick in rounds. I don't want to sit through any of that garbage. Just be nice to your opponent.

I think I'm done. If I missed something (which is probably the case) ask me to elaborate on that before the round.

Peace.
