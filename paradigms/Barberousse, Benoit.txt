I debated for two years in high school and have been judging and coaching high school policy debate in the Chicago Urban Debate league and on the ‘national circuit’ for the past six years. In that time, I’ve come to a number of principles concerning my judging:
  
 1 – I prefer clarity and volume over speed. It seems that my ears behave strangely in registering high-pitched sounds, so it would beneficial for you to attempt to be clear and loud before being fast. If it means slowing down, then it means slowing down. I’ll be sure to prompt you as best I can.
  
 2 – I don’t read evidence after the round. My feeling on this is that it encourages a lazy form of debate wherein questions of ‘spin’ are left to the judge to resolve. I believe debaters should resolve questions of interpretation concerning evidence in the debate by supporting their arguments with quotations from the evidence, logic, etc. Resolve spin control on the flow. You should already intuit that my not reading evidence after the round also means you cannot rely on me to conclude discussions in the debate unresolved after the 2AR: I will try my best to stick to my flow. You can understand why clarity and volume, thus, are of such high importance for me.
  
 3 – Procedural debate specifically must be slowed down on, as nothing is more conducive to a messy, incomplete flow than a fast theory debate consisting of eight word blips.
  
 4 – You can consider me to be tabula rasa: I will hear whatever argument, it is your job to provide conclusive reasons why and how I should vote for and against a position.
