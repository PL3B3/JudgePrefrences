  I graduated from Ankeny High School (IA) in 2013. I qualified to the TOC in LD in 2012 and 2013 and qualified to Nationals in LD my senior year. 

Short version:
I don't really care what you do as long as you're not offensive or malicious. I'm completely a blank slate. I will vote on things I find completely dumb if they are warranted within the round and impacted back to the decision calculus. I don't flow as fast as I once did, so if you can spread in the top 10% nationally you probably want to slow down a little bit. I will yell clear and slow. 

Nit-picky stuff:

-I'll evaluate any argument that's well warranted, properly extended, and impacts to an established framework. Anywhere from a stock AC to singing in your pajamas.

-I'm fine with speed, and I'll yell clear if necessary. Slow down for author names/anything you want to be sure I flow. Also, slow down between individual warrants/arguments in paragraph theory. I won't call for a case to see if the one sentence blurb you claim is a game over issue if you read it in 1.2 seconds in the AC.

-I decently understand basic K lit, like the backbone of the arguments, but don't assume I know what you're talking about. Especially crazy weird stuff. Also, make sure that you do interaction between the different layers of the debate. If it's something either really nuanced or really tricky, you got to make it clear.

-Theory ought to be ran where there is real abuse. That being said, I will vote for whatever direction the round goes. If you use theory as a strategy, I'm not going to punish you, just try and make it seem necessary to me. 

-I'll ignore sketchy contingent standards/hidden a prioris whose implications aren't clear the first time I hear them. You can be strategic, just don't be super sneaky.


-Don't assume I know common buzz words or strategies. Telling me that you control the internal link to his offensive RVI that supercharges your roll of the ballot means nothing to me. Please clearly implicate the function of arguments instead of assuming I know and will just do that analysis for you.


-I determine speaks based off how good the field is comparatively.
