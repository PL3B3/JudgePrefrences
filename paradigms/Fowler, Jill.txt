  I am an English teacher of 20 plus years. My specialty is oral communications.

In terms of debate, my philosophy is that debaters succeed when they communicate clearly, precisely, with sufficient and appropriate evidence, and then respond logically to their opponents. Simple. When asked a question, answer it. Don't answer a question with a question. Technique does NOT trump knowledge.

Also, a true debater is in control of his/her body. Distracting mannerisms count heavily against a score, in my book. Therefore speaking at speeds that defy understanding will both be distracting (as will the vein pulsating wildly in your neck) and loud gulps of air are inappropriate. 

Communicate effectively.
