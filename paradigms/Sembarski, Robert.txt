Hey 'der. My dresholds for all arguments are all very high. I will pretty much vote where my flow tells me to vote. I really enjoy a lot of clash in da round. dis means I love specific links to dis ads and kritiks and why dese arguments out weigh da affirmative, but if going for one of dese 2 in 2NR and decide dat case is not dat important, please note dat you dus concede da entire aff to da affirmative. So even dough I may grant you your politics dis ad and/or your cap k full weight, I dus have to weigh da k or da to da aff in my head, and you may not like da decsion. Same goes wid counterplans. Topicallity and Deory is fine. Performance is fine as well, just make sure you are topical.
