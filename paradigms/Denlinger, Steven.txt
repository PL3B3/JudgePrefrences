  As an LD Judge, I bring the following expectations to the round:
1. Speed:  Since this is only my second year of judging, speed is still a challenge for me. Slow down on the Tags. You can read the evidence as fast as you wish, but make sure you slow down and number your Tags/Contentions if you wish me to flow. I will never complain that you are going too slowly. :-)

2. Signposting: This is important. Make sure you signpost clearly so that I can clearly follow your argument.

3. Links: The link between each Contention and its Value needs to be crystal clear.

4. Topicality and Theory: Don’t use either as a time suck. You need to show me the abuse clearly.

5. Kritiks: I am still uncomfortable with Kritiks. If you decide to run one, make sure that it has a clear structure. In addition, in your crystallization, you need to show explicit links either to the opponent's advocacy or the resolution. Don’t run a Kritik if it is just as confusing to you as it is to me.

6. Extensions: Don’t just extend the tag and date. You need to also explain why that card is important, and what it does in the round.

7. Crystallization:  This is the crucial part of the round. You should be able to distill the entire debate into simple, clear voters. Write the ballot for me.

8. Tab:  I am as TAB as possible, but it is easier for me to see your argument if it is set within a classic LD argument with a V/VC structure. I am a human being, so I am not completely objective, but I try to be. You should know, however, that your Speaker Points will suffer if you run a morally repugnant argument during the round. If your opponent points this out, it will become a voter. 

9. Final Note:  Politeness and sportsmanship will always win you speaker points. This is an educational event and an intellectual sport, and I want to enjoy judging your round.
