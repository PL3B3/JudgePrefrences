  I'll try to make this brief, so if you have any other questions, please just ask me during the round. My general philosophy on LD can be summarized by the following:

Case Structure - Set up a clear framework, explain why it's important, and impact back to it. I prefer a V/VC, but I'm open to alternative structures if you justify them and tell me why I should prefer them.

Speed - I can flow reasonably fast cases, but it's up to the debater to speak in a mannerthat's comprehensible. If I can't understand what you're saying because you're slurring your words, I'm not going to catch your argument. Slow down especially for tags.

Theory - I have a high threshold for theory and you'll need to justify it thoroughly. Avoid theory unless there's very clear abuse; don't use it as a time suck.

Signposting - Very important, especially if you're speaking quickly.
