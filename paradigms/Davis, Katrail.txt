  I have no qualms against any type of debate. I am a straight policy debater though so I'm going to naturally understand these arguments a lot more. I'll listen to K affs/K's but they need to be well explained. I'm not going to vote on anything that I don't understand; this goes for any style.

I'm probably not convinced on T debates - potential abuse is rarely a voter. That being said if it is clearly a nontopical aff, a framework/t debate is justified and something I will vote on. 

You're probably going to win me over if you have a more comprehensible story than your opponent - technical debate is good but if at the end of the round I'm muddled on how exactly your counterplan/da/k/aff works then I'm probably not going to vote for you. 

don't be obnoxiously rude or I'll dock your speaks

I'm down to listen to any arguments you come up with
