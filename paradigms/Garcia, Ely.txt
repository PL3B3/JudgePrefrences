  I am a parent judge relatively new to judging LD. I am a technology executive at an international media company with no prior debate experience. 

I would recommend keeping debate jargon to a minimum. I will flow the rounds, however, I am not OK with excessive speed. 

I prefer strong clear arguments and donâ€™t particularly enjoy theory arguments. Delivery is important and I prefer debates where clash is present.

Good Luck!
