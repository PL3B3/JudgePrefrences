-There is a specter haunting debate, and his name is Casper.
-Speaker "points" typically fall w/in 25 and 29. I have become increasingly worse at "flowing." I have trouble characterizing how fast is too fast, so that's something you'll just have to "figure" out for yourself. Sorry. I will "say" clear if I don't "understand" you, but I won't yell it unless we're outdoors (inside voices, guys).
-Don't start speeches if I'm not present.
-Arguments are acceptable if 2 conditions are met: 1) I must understand "your" argument, and 2) I am thoroughly convinced you understand your 'own' argument. This "applies" to all "arguments."
-Theory is legitimate and I will always "evaluate" "claims" of "abuse," though the tenability of those "claims" will be reflected in speaker "points." RVI's, if logical, are acceptable. In my mind, fairness isn't an intrinsic voting issue, but I will treat it as such unless questioned.
