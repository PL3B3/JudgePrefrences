  Quick Summary:
I'm okay with everything I just want it to be run well.
That means:
Yes I'm okay with everything from stock-issue based arguments to Kritiks/Framework/Performance. I just want a good-clean debate.
Open CX is fine by me, I leave it up to the debaters to decide unless the tournament dictates otherwise. I will keep a universal timer (but I prefer the debaters also keep track, I am only human) just in case there is a disagreement on prep and whatnot. I do not count flashing as prep-time as long as it's not excessive. 
Longer Version:
I'm a firm believer in debate as an activity in which debaters should be capable of expressing themselves in whichever means they wish. By that I mean everything is game, you may even debate about debate. This does not mean I side with either "traditional" or "progressive" norms. Rather I like a good debate I have seen incredible Debaters argue both regards so what I want to see is a good clash. Fair warning, if you believe an argument is dumb and choose not to even address it (and it is in fact utilized well by your opponent) that will likely be a major factor in my decision. I respect the community's split opinion on what debate should be but until there is a set standard of debate (which to be frank, I don't see that happening without restricting speech) every argument should be given respect. You owe that to each other as debaters at the very least. I have debated CX for 3 years in Highschool and debated for UTDallas for a bit. I am capable of judging LD or CX. Same ideas on arguments with CX apply to LD. I understand many LD'ers are "traditional" LD and I respect that but that doesn't mean you can ignore your "progressive" opponent's arguments. All in all, have fun if you have any questions feel free to chat with me if you see me walking around. The most important thing to get out of this is to have fun!
