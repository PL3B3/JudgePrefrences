I used to have a long and in-depth judge philosophy, but I don't think it was very helpful, so I've drastically shortened it. Run whatever you are most comfortable with. I'm fine with speed and will clear you. If you have any other questions, ask me before round or email me at colwhite54@gmail.com.

Bio:

I compete in college debate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where we mostly do NFA-LD and sometimes dabble in parli. I'm the LD director at the Nebraska Debate Institute. I competed for four years in high school. I have experience or familiarity with most debate events.

See you in round and good luck!
