  I'm a retired psychologist and a parent judge. My daughter currently does LD debate at Cypress Woods HS in Houston, TX.

I prefer the traditional value/criterion case structure. If you read your arguments in a different format, you must explain how they function in the debate. I will flow the round and do my best to evaluate it objectively, but I will only vote for arguments that are clearly explained the first time I hear them. This also means that arguments should be articulated at a conversational pace. Please signpost throughout the debate and give clear voters. Be polite to your opponent at all times during the round!

Feel free to ask me more specific questions beforehand.
