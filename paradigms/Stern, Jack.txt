  I'll vote on anything - frivolous theory, tricks, etc. are all fine. Truth > Tech except for stuff in "Stuff to not read in front of me." Other than that, I try to be avoid being dogmatic as much as possible, so you do you. If an argument is bad, then it shouldn't be hard to beat. I'm also not very susceptible to ethos, so win on the flow even if your opponent is much more persuasive than you and I'll vote you up.

Stuff to not read in front of me (Probably don't read these in front of me unless you're absolutely amazing at defending them):
1) Non-Topical Critical/Performance Affs

Some args that are great (I will be happy to vote on these, but I won't evaluate them any differently than another argument):
1) Disclosure Theory
2) Brackets Theory
3) Innovative Tricks

Some args that are good (I'm fine voting either way on these and running these args won't affect my decision, but I enjoy seeing good debates on these):
1) Topicality
2) Unique and Well-Executed Theory Shells

Some args that are okay (I'm fine with evaluating these debates):
1) Policy Args
2) Phil Args
3) Kritiks that aren't dumb
