  I see LD debate as different from policy, in that it asks us to evaluate questions of value. I like to see both a value and criterion in your case, and for you to weigh your arguments through your criteria and impact through your value. I will take empirical examples into consideration, but they do not weigh as heavily for me as philosophical arguments grounded in moral philosophy which address the underlying value premise of the resolution. If you spread, make sure that I can understand you or I won't flow your arguments.
