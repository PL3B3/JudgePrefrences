I am the former director of forensics at Christopher Columbus High School in Florida, Hopkins High School in Minnesota, and Harvard-Westlake School in California. I have also coached parliamentary debate for the University of Colorado at Boulder and work in auto finance.

(1) I'll vote for any argument. So long as it has a claim, warrant/data, and a reason why it's relevant to my ballot, I'll vote for it. This includes (but is not limited to) theory goo, critical arguments, non-topical affirmatives/negatives, plans, criticisms of the aforementioned approaches, traditional cases, and the like.

Two caveats here: (a) you must explicitly tell me how to prioritize various winning arguments on the flow. In most debates, both sides win some arguments. Tell me how I should resolve that problem (i.e. why your arguments are best).

(b) I will not vote for an argument that I do not understand. It is your job to ensure that I "get" the arguments you want me to use as the basis for my decision. I'm old, but comprehend fancy arguments. It's your duty to make the arguments well.

(2) I can write very quickly and understand extremely fast debates. If that's your game, play it. If it's not your game, don't play it. I'd rather that you just do what you do best. Let the debate sort out everything else.
