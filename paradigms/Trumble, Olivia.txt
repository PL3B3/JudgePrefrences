  I'm graduated from Lake Highland Preparatory School in 2016. I haven't had to listen to full out spreading recently, so please please do not go 100% maybe like 80% if you're a speed demon (I will say slow if need be).

Jokes are fantastic (+Speaker points). If you're absurdly rude to your opponent you will lose speaker points. I really like T, and you'll really have to explain K's to me if its anything more complex than Wilderson or intersectional arguments. Feel free to ask any other questions.
