I'm primarily an LD judge. I have four years of high school debate experience, during three of which I judged. I am not too unusual in my LD judging paradigm. I want to see the following things:

--A strong flow/note-taking strategy
--Reliable sources
--Debate centered around ethics, rather than evidence
--Effective Cross-ex strategies
--No talking to the judge (me) during speeches, but rather to an audience (even if one isn't there)
--NO spreading
--A calm, collected speaker
--sharp dressing (I tend to distrust slouches)

If I am judging PF, my paradigm is very similar to the one above (except for the third on the list). One thing extra, however, is that I want to see partners work together well. I don't want two independent debates going on with each person on a team; I want one debate controlled by a strong team working as a unit.

One extra note on Kritiks: I REALLY like them if executed well. I have voted for them in the past and am willing to do so again if they are persuasive and still promote clash with the opponent.
