  I competed in speech and debate in high school I am the phi ro pi national champion for dramatic interpretation 2012. I am the California state gold award finalist for Parliamentary Debate.
I will be competting for university of Pacific debate next fall

1. please do not make me do any work for you. so make clear extensions. signpost. things of that nature. i will not intervene for you.
2. speed: im pretty ok with speed, especially with anything at a jv level. if you are going to spread however, please make sure 1. that it's clear and 2. that it's actually necessary. i extremely dislike people who speed and arent good at it. i also think it's a dirty tactic to speed for the sake of speeding, confusing the hell out of your opponent and judge, then pulling out some argument in your last speech that your opponent didn't respond to and making me vote off of it. i am not going to vote for anything i dont understand. 
3. i'm pretty much ok with you running anything as long as you clearly and well explain it. that includes any policy-esque counterplans, kritiks, etc.
4. theory. only use it if there is actual abuse. 
5. don't run a priori arguments. i think they're stupid. 
6. PLEASE WEIGH. i dont know how many rounds i've seen where debaters do not weigh. weighing is so important to a round! give me proactive reason to value your arguments/extensions over your opponents. 
7. i generally prefer substantive contentional level debate over highly theoretical or philosophical arguments.
8. ill try to give you critique at the end of the round on what you can improve :) the educational part of debate is just as important!
if you have any further questions after critique, please feel free to ask.
