Debated at Dartmouth, Currently Asst. Dir. of Debate at Towson University

I see debate as a performance, and I vote for the better performance. That performance can include any number of kinds of arguments. A performance has stakes for an audience both immediate and abstracted elsewhere. That performance should involve the endorsement (or no) of a certain politic.

Debate how you can, the best you can. 

Swag is good. Complexity. Concretization. Examples. Impact Framing and Comparison.
