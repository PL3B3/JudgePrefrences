Above all else, go for what you’re good at and debate the way you want. That said, here are a few of my predispositions:

-Please do not sacrifice clarity for speed. I make no apologies for missing arguments that were uttered incoherently. I find myself docking speaker points for lack of clarity more often than anything else.

-Take advantage of cross-ex time, it’s important. Use the time to impress/persuade me and your speaker points will definitely reflect that. Humor is a huge plus! 

- KRITIKS: I prefer policy debates to Kritik debates 100% of the time, but if Kritiks are what you’re best at you should go for them. Keep in mind, however, that I am not that familiar with the literature and that a lot of the usual jargon means nothing to me, so you will have to spend more time developing your arguments than if you were to go for a policy strategy. Also, just because you are running a Kritik does NOT mean you can do without specific links, turns case arguments, and impact calculus. Even the smartest of Kritik teams seem to forget this. (FRAMEWORK: affs need to have a topical plan. On everything else, I can be persuaded either way).

-TOPICALITY: Fine. 

-THEORY: Also fine, but I should warn you that I was a 2N throughout my debate experience and my biases reflect that: dispositionality is definitely good, conditionality is almost always good, PICs are also good, etc. I can be convinced otherwise, but it will take lots of work on your part. Also, I reject the argument not the team, and persuading me to do otherwise is an uphill battle.

-Dropped arguments are true arguments.
