  Bellarmine College Prep (CA) '13
Stanford '17 (not debating)

This is for the California Invitational '14. (Do not know the resolutions for any event...don't speak in acronyms).

Background:
I did public forum debate for most of high school, with a brief early venture into policy. I anticipate that I'll be mostly judging the former, but if I am judging you for policy read the appropriate section below. I wasn't a policy debater, but I am fairly knowledgeable about the event because of my early experience and my friends who did participate in it.

Just a few basic things to know about me, I strongly value evidence being read in round. That being said, people misquoting or otherwise blatantly misrepresenting their evidence is really bad in my view. So, do that and you risk getting really low speaks. Don't be rude/arrogant to the opposing debaters. What you might think as being funny is usually not to the judge. 

Policy:
I'm a slow judge. Don't spread. I can follow fast arguments, but please don't read a kritik and don't make the debate about ridiculously overblown impacts. That's all I really have to say. Don't spread and don't get too ridiculous (at least in the mind of a slow debater).

Pofo:
Crossfire should be a chance for both sides to speak. Don't talk over your opponent. I'm not stupid. If the person you're debating won't let you get in a question or complete your thoughts, I'll note that myself. I expect evidence to be presented promptly during prep time/crossfire. If the evidence is contested and then isn't given/read directly from in a reasonable manner, I will take that argument off of my flow (you'll also lose speaks). 

Good luck to people competing! Enjoy the tournament.
