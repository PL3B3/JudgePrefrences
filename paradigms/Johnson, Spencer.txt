I debated for four years at Valley High School in the late 90's and early 21st century, i then debated for four years and the University of Texas. I last spent a year coaching for St. Stephens Episcopal High School in 2009 and after a two year hiatus in the world of finance I am back coaching for Dowling. I missed the game. 

As for debate arguements;
i like conditionality, am open to any theory debate you have ever considered and many you have never heard: you should write on my erased slate – i prefer tabula masala, a little spice in my theory ( can no longer recall where i stole this from), but you make the call – i will decide the debates the way you want me to, but you must tell me how to decide, what’s important, and how to weigh arguments; i have voted on counter-warrants; if you asked for it, you got it. 

However if not prompted to weigh things properly you leave me to my own devices in this regard. If i could see any kind of debate it would be a process cp and politics debate, but i usually end up with K debates anyways...
if both teams would prefer that i judge in a particular way, then i will: i will read and reread cards at the end of the debate.

thanks to a certain someone who i totally ripped most of this philosophy off from, but it seemed suitable for me.
