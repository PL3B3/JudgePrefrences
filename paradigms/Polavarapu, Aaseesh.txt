  I debated for four years at Brentwood High School (TN). My decision usually comes from the criterion. I like seeing arguments impacted to the standard and weighed out for me. A good way to win my ballot is to resolve the standards debate fairly early and impact to the criterion throughout the round. Speed is ok, if necessary, but I definitely do not prefer it. I would suggest you don't go excessively fast unless you feel that it is absolutely necessary. Be warned that any argument I don't get down won't factor into my decision at the end of the round. In my eyes, theory is normally unnecessary and is not an effective strategy to get my ballot. The last speeches should have clear voting issues as to why you won the round with clear links back to the standard.
