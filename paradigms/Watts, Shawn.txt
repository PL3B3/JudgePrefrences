  I am the Director of Debate at Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn, NY. I used coached at La Cueva High School in Albuquerque, NM. I also debated for Charles Page High School in Sand Springs, OK. I've been debating/coaching/judging for 18 years.

I'm not sure there is very much to my philosophy because I'm willing to hear and vote on any area of argumentation. I am open to being put into different paradigms and use policy as a default if neither teams puts me into one. I like to have teams make decisions in the later rebuttals and really appreciate strategies that allow the round to be focused on just a couple of key arguments at the end.

If I have a preference it is for the 2NR to go for only theory if she chooses to go for theory at all. I'm not fond of being asked to vote on topicality and case or disads. I do love the boldness and clarity when teams just for for theory.

I appreciate and am able to flow speed. So, far I haven't heard a debater I couldn't flow. I have, however, heard plenty of debaters whose lack of clarity, articulation, and inflection made them almost impossible to understand. It's the debater's burden to make sure I am getting their arguments on paper. I like fast talking--the faster the better--but I LOVE articulation most of all.
