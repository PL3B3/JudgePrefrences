  3 Years Highschool PFD Debate
3 Years College Policy Debate
(Policy)
1. I'm fine with speed. Obviously if you're forcing it and sound off and you dont see me flowing then you need to slow down (which you and your partner should be observing anyway).
2. You will benefit greatly by slowing down on tag lines and reading plans, and flipping between flows.
(PFD + Policy)
I'm really big on the technical side of debate. That means clearly outlining and discussing the:
1. Impact Calculus
-Timeframe

-Magnitude
-Probability
-How your impacts relate to your opponent's impacts
-How these impacts actually happen, the full story behind them, paint a picture. ELI5
2. Links
-They do X so they link, is not a link.
-I weight links pretty heavily in arguments so I prefer when debates spend time to contextualize the links within the story of the debate
3. Uniqueness
-Usually not an issue but i've been surprised before, often gets assumed
4. Internal Link
-Im very skeptical of you just arriving at extinction. I mainly ran policy arguments so I know how ridiculously easy it is to just fit in 16 extinction scenarios in your constructed speech but I need to see that internal link debate fleshed out.
5. Open to any kritiks/performance but the above bullets apply even more so. I do not like when teams brush over the technical side of debate just because they arent running nuclear war. Arguments are still arguments and logic is still logic.
6. Framework - I lean towards debate being a game. That being said, there are obviously millions of ways to debate within that framework.
Anything else just ask.
