  Strikes- Dripping Springs

My name is Shelton Stewart:
I have competed in LD and Policy debate over my high school career. I predominately debated in the Austin Circuit, TFA, in LD. I also competed at tournaments like Harvard, University of Texas, and tfa state.

Paradigm
Theory: I lean slightly more to reasonability, than competing-interpretations. 

Kritiks: The standards I have for K’s are 1) you understand the literature behind it and 2) You have an alterative that isn't reject the aff, unless its heavily warranted or serves as some type of discourse check.

Speed: I wont stop flowing. I will say clear one time per speech, but in most cases will not have trouble flowing speed. I wouldn’t worry about it too much.

Orals: I will attempt and disclose, with an oral RFD after the round.

Speaker Points: Based on your Strat and performance. This includes:
Time ManagementUnderstandingBreathing/ClarityArgumentationWinningI probably wont give lower speaker points than 25 (unless you say something Racist, Sexist, Offensive, ect.)

Flex prep is fine.

 Overall, I am a pretty tabjudge. Do what you wish, but please do it well. This is your round and I am just someone hired to decide who wins.
