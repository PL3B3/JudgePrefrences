I debated in high school for four years, but have not debated in
college. I have judged probably about 20 varsity rounds in my short lifetime away from
high school debate, but I will generally listen to any argument, but I have a small
disposition against conditionality and for PICS, but I will only look at the arguments
made in the round. Additionally, impact calculus is very important for me.
