  I have been judging speech and debate tournaments for the past 3 years - since 2014.
I have judged everything from interpretation to LD and PF.
My preferences are debate categories particularly LD.
I am a fair judge and base my decision only on what and how the case is presented. I leave my personal biases at the door.
The competitors can present in a way that is comfortable to themselves and respectful of their opponents.
Spreading is fine with me as long as the competitors are not averse to it.
Strength of case is always a determining point if it is a close decision.
I have given low point wins a few times if I feel the case of a somewhat weaker speaker is stronger than the better speakers.
Judging has allowed me to see up close that the future is in the hands of some bright - and well spoken - individuals.
