  I was a Public Forum Debater at Coral Springs High School for 4 years. I understand the structure of an argument and how to flow a round, but would not be a good judge for you to go fast or use complex theoretical arguments. Make everything simple and clear and be very clear with your voting issues at the end of the round.
