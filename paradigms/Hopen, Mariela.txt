  University School (FL)

I am the mother of Brandon Hopen and judge frequently in local tournaments to meet judging requirements for University School. As a parent judge I will do my best to take notes and flow the round; however, while I'm not opposed to speed philosophically I cannot keep up with a quick round. Please communicate clearly and provide effective crystallization at the end.
