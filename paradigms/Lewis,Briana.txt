Overview

I'm pretty much down for anything. I like high theory/performance/race debates. I am willing to judge policy rounds.

Don't adapt too much for me. Doing something you're not willing to run/aren't comfortable with will only make the round more painful for the both of us.

In CX I like wit, passion, a little attitude. Defend your ev. Defend your args. (This is easier if you know your ev/args)

Do you boo boo.
Specifics

1. Left Rounds
Make sure you hit all the moving parts (impact, alt, role of the ballot etc...)

Engage with the other team's args. What do they say in realtion to what you say and why that matter. This gets unclear in some spots.

Long-winded preachy-preachy speeches are annoying, they almost never answer anything. I end up feeling like you used the speech time as a soap-box.


2.Throwback (Policy) Rounds

I hate ptx. I hate calling for cards. But I will if that's the best strat in the round. Do not forgoe some strat because of my personal preferences, just do more work on that flow to make me listen and not hate you.


Topicality is whatever just impact it properly, compare interps, and if called out explain why you aren't violently exclusive of anyone.

Everything else is pretty much meh.


3. Left on Policy
Make all the important comparisons.

Why should I prefer policy action over the alt?

Why is their method problematic?

Basically, have an engaing debate with the other team...
