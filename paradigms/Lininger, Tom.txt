  I'm the debate coach at South Eugene High School in Eugene, Oregon. Our policy debaters compete on the national circuit. 

i'm also a professor at the University of Oregon, where I've taught various subjects including law, comparative government and international relations. I was a lawyer before I became a professor.

JD Harvard, BA Yale, lots of debate along the way.

I'm not going to write too much here because this is YOUR round. From my perspective, speed is fine, any K is fine, any competitive CP is fine, esoteric theory is fine, and T is also fair game (but rarely dispositive unless the aff has really overreached). If you prefer a straight-up policy debate, I'm fine with that too. I'll listen to anything. Just build your arguments carefully and explain why you think you have won.

When I flow, I devote a separate sheet to each argument. I'd appreciate a brief off-time roadmap in advance of each speech so I can put my flow sheets in order. You'll make a better record if you give a plain label for each point.

Be a good sport, don't whine, and above all, have fun!
