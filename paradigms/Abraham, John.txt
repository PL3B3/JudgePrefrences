  The way I evaluate the round based on what I see happening in the round obviously, my opinions don't matter if it is not addressed in the debate. 

Speed- 9/10.. Slow down on card names and tag lines.

Philosophy- Philosophy minor so I am not against any philosophical view, I won't down you simply because I cant accept deontology as a POV. One of my favorites is Nietzsche, if you run him well props.

Arguments- I am open to all arguments I honestly don't have any bias to where if you support immorality and I don't I'll automatically down you, if you win the argument i'll give you the credibility for it. Now, most arguments have cards and opponents like reading counter evidence.. Thats GREAT, but if there is no link or warrant for why I should prefer your evidence you wasted your time. If a card is not responded to the right way (i.e. argument/counter evidence + warrant) I will ignore it or more than likely just not write anything anything. For example, "Inevitable" or "Impossible" one word arguments are not gonna suffice, you must have a warrant. Lastly, turn does not mean anything, if your gonna use a turn make sure to specify if its a link turn or an impact turn and how you are winning the argument to generate your offense.

Evidence- Keep it real, don't cheat. Just have the sources and citation just in case.

Theory- I have a high t If theory is not ran the right way (i.e. interpretation, violation, standards and voters) it doesn't count. Simply saying ground skew doesn't make it a theory argument. Make sure the violation and voters are clear or else I won't vote on the shell.

Speaker Points- Usually range from 25-29, its all about your clarity and fluency. They don't let me give 30's..

Remember in the end of the day debate is a game. Enjoy every round have fun, sarcasm is great just don't be a dick and down talk your opponent unless it serves humorous purposes..

Any other questions feel free to ask before the round starts.
