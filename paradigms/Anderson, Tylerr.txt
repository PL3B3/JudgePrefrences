  I like clear big pictures, clear burdens and clear clash. I like a debater who has a strong grasp on a consistent position. I want warrants and impacts for everything. I like substantive debate. If your argument or position is confusing, vague, circular or empty I am not likely to vote on it, period.

There should be a clear criterion, burden or decision-making calculus provided by debaters. Debaters should extend and weigh arguments, and tell me at the end of the last speech what the voters are and why. Signpost, please.

I don't like speed. I don't really like theory. In the past, I have given lower speaks than most judges, but I have revised this. Now my typical range is 25-30.
