  I am typically a tab judge who defaults to policy maker given no other framework. I vote on risk and pretty much any other argument you can throw out. I will not listen to racist, or sexist language or arguments and will most likely give 0 speaks. I don't care about your attire as long as you have some on.i prefer that you keep your own time and prep time. I have a high threshold on T so prove to me the abuse story or it's a no go. I'm ok with the K, the CP, and any theory you want to run. Just warrant your arguments and terminalize your impacts and give me voters.
