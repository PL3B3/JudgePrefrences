  Jessica McClellan.
I competed for Shanley High School from 2002-2006 in Policy and PF. Currently am coaching at Shanley High School in LD, Policy, and PF. In LD I am open to any arguments as long as they make sense. I can handle most any speed. I would like you to tell me what to vote on.

Any questions just ask
