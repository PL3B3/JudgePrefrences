  I competed in high school debate for 4 years. I am now competing in my final year as a Parli debater on the collegiate circuit. This means that I can keep up with your speed. I am fine with T and procedurals, I will default to an abuse paradigm but will listen to competing interpretations. If you do ask me to evaluate on an abuse paradigm, I need articulated abuse (that means run the position and let them de-link). I am fine with Kritiks as I am studying rhetoric and argumentation. Also, I believe that if the alternative of the K is meant to be a better option than case or the squo and I need to know how that works... so have solvency for the K. I am also not fond of reject only, I will listen to it, but I don't know how rejecting something a lone will get me anywhere. I love CP and Perm debates so have at it. Overall please keep things structured and organized I am a flow judge so keeping the debate clean will help my flow (and decision) to be more accurate. Lastly, I think debate is a game so have fun and good luck.
