  I did 3 years of LD debate on the circuit at Vestavia Hills. You can go as fast as you want. In case you go too fast, I will yell speed, and I will yell clear if you are unclear. Also, please slow down on theory, kritiks, taglines and card authors. Other than that, I'm fine with all types of argumentation. Just give me a reason for why I should vote on it, where it comes in terms of layering in the round, and weigh. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask
