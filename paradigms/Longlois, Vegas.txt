  I was an LD debater in high school (2008-2012) and am currently a fourth year American Parliamentary debater. I am fine with most arguments, as long as they are well executed. I can handle moderate to high speed. If you are unclear, I will say "clear" until I can hear you or I will put down my pen at a point. Please be nice to each other and do not make discriminatory arguments. I will dock speaker points for rudeness. I value substance over style. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have!
