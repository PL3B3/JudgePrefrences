  I did LD for four years at Harvard-Westlake High School in Los Angeles, California. I'm not the best with speed, but I'm okay with moderate speed- I will shout clear a couple times if I can't understand you.

I'm pretty comfortable with any (warranted!) arguments you want to run, but explain them to me if they're confusing, since I'm not a philosophy professor and you should not pretend like I am.

The most important thing to remember in front of me is to explain how your arguments function in the round and why your arguments mean I should vote for you. Sometimes when I vote against debaters, it's not necessarily because they did not make the right arguments, but more because they did not explain how these arguments functioned in the round, I decided that they functioned in a different way than the debater thought they did, and they lost. Don't make this mistake- tell me how your arguments function in the round and why your arguments win the round for you.
