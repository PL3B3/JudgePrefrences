  I debated for three years at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (a high school in Austin) and currently debate as a freshman for UT Austin. I undertook my debate education with policy-style arguments, so I can judge a disad/counterplan debate no problem. These days I'm more about the K; that's where my research energy is dedicated. I don't have much topic-specific knowledge, so don't expect me to know the ins-and-outs of your aff without some explanation. Also: I'm fine with cheater stuff like PIKs and process counterplans and 3 conditional worlds, but will gladly vote the other way if you mess up the theory debate. If you want to win reasonability, actually explain why it's preferable to competing interps; just saying the phrase "race to the bottom" does not do it. Email me at elijah.barrish@gmail.com if you have questions and/or complaints about this judge philosophy's glaring holes.
