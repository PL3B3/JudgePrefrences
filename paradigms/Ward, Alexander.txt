Judge: 2011-Current
Policy Maker (Primary) , Tab., and Games Player.

I'm a realist, meaning i follow logic. Be logical and rational. Follow the rules at the tournement. Have fun, but not at the expense of others in the room, including me the judge. I go to tournements to help debaters learn, and improve, but also to improve myself as a debater.
