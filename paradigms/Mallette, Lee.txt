Every argument is valid and a voting issue as long as you can articulate its validity. I will vote on T/Theory/K and pretty much anything else you can throw at me. Big fan of impact turns and anything aggressive against a plan, but I won't ever make an argument for you. Spreading is fine as long as you're clear. Don't be aggressive in CX and don't make me drop your speaker points because I can't stand you. 

Happy to answer any questions you have before round. Also always happy to give an RFD post round and answer any questions after.
