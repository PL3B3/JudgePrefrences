  Debate Background:

Currently coach in rural school outside of Houston, squad competes in TFA, UIL, NFL, judge at all levels/all events

Judging Philosophy:
 I am at heart a stock issues judge, as I was trained in that school of thought. However, I can and will vote for a well constructed, well defended argument. The K is the hardest sell, if you are going to go for it, it needs to be one of your strongest arguments if you want me to buy it. I like a good case attack, DAs and applicable T arguments.Make sure arguments are well supported and explained.

Be organized, road map and sign post.

I have no problem with speed, as long as it is clear. I will drop my pen if I can't understand you. If it doesn't go on the flow, it doesn't go into the decision. Debate is a communication event, so clarity is a vital component of the activity. 

Be respectful of one another, approach debate with dignity.
