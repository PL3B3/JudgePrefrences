1. Coherent and morally relevant Ks
2. Speed should remain below 300
3. Go for your CPs/Ps
4. Coherent and morally relevant theory
5. Truth over tech
6. Explicitness demonstrates mastery of content, but in the right areas and to the right degrees. LD is meant to vulgarize complex arguments for the sake of the lay person's enlightenment. Show that you can weigh significant information (meriting mention) from relatively insignificant information (which can be weeded out.) This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the moral topic rather than mimicry of successful argument structures. 
7. The mark of mastery also comes through in the awareness and willingness necessary to help your judge perform the nuanced moral calculus that these topics require.
