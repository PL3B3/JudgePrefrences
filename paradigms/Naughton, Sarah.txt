  4 Years of LD debate, local and national circuit. 2011.

Value/Criterion Debate: I judge first and foremost on a value centered debate. Strong clash and strong argument weighing typically can solidify a round for you. You must uphold the entirety of the structure though. You need to prove why your criterion is the best vehicle for which ever value you accept. 

If you are presenting the same Value, either assert which definition ought be used and why, then push the criterion clash through. If the values are different, you must prove why your value is paramount and essential to the round to be preferred. If you drop your value and adopt your opponents please address why your criterion upholds it the best. Concede the framework if you have to. But to win the round, best uphold whichever value you are arguing towards.

There must be structured clash, Don’t only assert why your case is great, but why your opponents its flawed. – You must weigh values and impacts of what you are saying.

Kritiks: Very much so prefer that you do not run Kritiks. Observations about the resolution are perfectly fine, but please try not to run Kritiks. It is much easier to win in front of me on a more standard position. If you do in fact run the kritik because that is what you are best at, that’s fine, just give me and your opponent the way to evaluate the round, and set standards to be met.

Speed: I can handle Speed, but make sure you are clear and loud on ALL taglines for contentions and subpoints as well as any cards cards. No spreading, anything over an aggressive conversational speed I’ll just stop. You will be able to tell if I stop flowing, I’ll put my pen down and probably look generally disgruntled. If I don’t get it on the flow I will call to see the tagline or Card to get the information, and that’s no fun for anyone! So be sure to enunciate the things that are most important to your case.

Dropped Arguments: I will flow through dropped points, but please address the fact that they were dropped and why it critical for the debate- IE structure and use your time well so you aren’t brining up new points in the 2AR. If you just tell me they dropped it and it’s a concession then I can’t do much with that fact. Need you to weigh it back to the debate.

Time: I’ll give hand signals if you want, Once times up, Ill verbally stop you give or take a few seconds. It will hurt your speaks if you go aggressively over

Speaker Points: Eye contact, you will be much more engaging and up your points. Speak persuasively and with passion. It will help your speaker points. CX can be a good time to up your speaks.


Misc Tips:
-Road map before each speech. If I don’t know where you’re going my flow is already not in your favor. 
-Define key words in the resolution 
-Theory is fine as long as it upholds a value structure. 
-Please use your prep time! It is there for you to utilize and gather coherent thoughts.
-Be sure to be a good sport and shake everyone’s hand. That stuff matters. Unless your very sick… just say that you are sick 
-I don’t disclose, unless I have too. I need time to look over my flow and decide. 
-Naming the source of cards- year included please. 
-I will mark you down heavily for abuse. Don’t do it. 
-Impact turns are encouraged as they can be a successful way for you to win the round, by subsuming any positive impacts from your opponents.
