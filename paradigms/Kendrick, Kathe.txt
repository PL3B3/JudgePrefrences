  I am a homeschool mom. My sons have been involved in Team Policy and Parliamentary debate for several years, however I have no debate experience myself. 

I have a conservative background.

If you want me to understand you, do not speed or spread. If you use debate jargon, please define it. Clearly tag and provide support for your arguments. Make it clear why I need to vote for your position. I judge off my flow. If it doesn't get written down, I usually don't judge on it.

Be courteous to your opponent. Rudeness will not win the round.
