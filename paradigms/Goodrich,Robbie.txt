I believe debate has a significant educational value that goes far beyond research and accumulation of knowledge. Therefore I consider debate a unique pedagogical experience and the participants should act accordingly.

Paperless Debate: Novices catch a break. JV and Open, “all time” in between speeches that is not CX will be Prep.

Decision Calculus: “…each decision is different and requires an absolutely unique interpretation, which no existing, coded rule can or ought to guarantee completely…” Derrida 1990

I will place a high value on your performance. Therefore your Ethical stance, use of Logic, and Pathos will be evaluated within the presented Framework(s) in-round. In my opinion debates that examine the historical and socio-cultural significance of law are very important. Furthermore I understand debates that are technical and treat this communications activity as a game but these debates will be critiqued thru a lens that requires the debaters to be epistemologically responsible for their choice of rhetoric deployed; both “pre” and “post” fiat. Finally I place a significant value on growing a productive reflexivity within debate and enjoy debates about debate.

Speaker Points: I will “not” use a tournament rubric. Historically I am a stingy. If you don’t trust me don’t pref me. Cross Apply Derrida 1990.
