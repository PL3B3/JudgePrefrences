  My name is Phyllis Rothblatt.

I am a parent judge. I have two years experience judging traditional LD debate. I will be able to understand all arguments, including progressive (National Circuit) ones, if they are delivered at a normal speaking pace and explained and implicated with no excessive use of jargon. Basically, you don't need to adapt your arguments themselves, but you definitely need to adapt your style of debate. I will probably not understand the debate if it becomes overly technical, so you need to explain technical things extremely clearly if you want me to vote off of them. 

Please remember to be respectful in the round. Respect paired with strong rhetorical skills and interesting, well-explained arguments will earn you good speaker points. 

I will not verbally disclose after the round.
