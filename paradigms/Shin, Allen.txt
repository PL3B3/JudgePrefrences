  Hello, I am lay judge. I never judged before, and I don't know much about LD, or debate in general for that matter.

I am NOT used to listening to people talk fast, so please talk slowly and clearly. (NO SPREADING). Also, signpost your speech well, so that I can follow them.

When I consider a round to be a draw, I vote for the better speaker (the person who speaks clearly and loudly).

Also, impact your speeches, and talk about voting issues!

Thanks.
