  Hi - 

I debated for Notre Dame HS for 4 years and am currently at UCLA, but not debating. I judged last year for several tournaments and stay updated with HS topics.

Info you might find helpful...This is by no means an extensive or deep philosophy, but it should be a place to jump off of. I am a pretty "straight-up" judge.

Theory - I find that theory debates are often not debated well because they lack impact debates. I will not vote for a team that claims "theory is a voting issue" because it generally is not, unless there is an articulated reason why it is. For me process cp are usually a bad thing, but not necessarily something that should not be debated. 

T - Close debates usually favor the affirmative. I think that list of topical affs help the negative.

K - I am a huge fan! When the K's are specifically applied to affirmative or negative cards I am more likely to vote for them. Make sure to say why the K turns each and every advantage! 

Framework - The affirmative gets to use their aff! I think that the negatives should have an alternative and if so then they should be able to debate it!
