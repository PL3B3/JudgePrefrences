  I am a community judge who has been judging at various Coast Forensic League Tournaments in the Bay Area. I have been judging Lincoln/Douglas debate for 2-3 years. I do have limited experience judging upper-echelon varsity debate.

I do flow the debate, although my flow may not always say what you want it to say. I will do my best to follow you, but cannot handle speedy debate. Please keep your jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy.

Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
