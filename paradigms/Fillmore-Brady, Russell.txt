  I did Public Forum debate in high school at Evanston Township High School. I have only occasionally judged LD. 

I'm a smart guy with a background in debate, and I can follow most arguments if they are presented and warranted clearly. 

I have no real argumentative preferences. I will not be able to flow any real spreading. Speaking quickly is fine, but once you start spreading a card or something I will not be able to understand it. I am fine with critical arguments, theory, whatever, I just need it explained to me. 

So, basically, I'm not your preferred judge, but I might not be a strike? 

Ooh, also, I like to laugh, and I like people to be nice to one another, and I will be shocked and disappointed if people are mean to each other, and I will throw hands if people are being racist or sexist or other forms of oppressive to each other.
