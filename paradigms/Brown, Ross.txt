  background: i debated for valley high school for four years. i qualified to the toc three times and made it to finals my senior year. i currently coach at the university school in ft. lauderdale, fl.

default model of debate: i'll vote on any warranted argument with an impact as to why that argument deserves my ballot. i strongly prefer viewing the resolution as something the aff must prove true and the neg must prove false, but i am open to different burden structures.
speed: fine, i'll yell clear if i can't understand you. if i have to yell clear multiple times your speaks will suffer.
theory: no problems with it. i'm not a huge fun of rvis, but i'll vote on them if necessary. 

if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.
