What paradigm best describes your approach to debate?_Policy Maker _Stock Issues Tabula Rasa_Games Player _Hypothesis Tester X Other (Explain)
Although I would consider myself a Tabula Rasa judge, I still give weight to stock issues and the burden of proof that the Aff team has. 

What do you think the Aff burdens should be? Burden of Proof, prove net benefits and rebuttal all Neg arguments. 

What do you think the Neg burdens should be? Argue what is net beneficial in round and place offense on case. 

How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)? Speeding is ok as long as I can flow it, if I can’t understand it then it will not show up on my flow. I find most high school students are not good at spreading, so perhaps it would be better that they play it safe and slow down.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks? You can run anything with me. 

How I feel about case debates? I think that debate stock issues are essential to the round. I have judged harms cases and comparative advantages cases.
