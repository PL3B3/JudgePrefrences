A little about me, before we get into it. I competed mostly in Foreign Extemp in HS, but also in PF, LD, and Congress (I know, I know).
I'm looking for clear, compelling, & creative arguments above all.

I will try my best to go through everything I'm presented with in round, regardless of what it is (critique, counterplan etc). I am new to
spreading, but I understand why you all do it, so I'll just yell if I missed something.

Critiques- I'm not a debater by nature, so these are new to me. As long as you do clear impact analysis, I'm fine with them.

Counterplans- Again, I need a complete impact analysis and a good explanation w/ signposting.
DA- also fine

T- I think topicality is sort of a last resort, it is very difficult, in my mind, to run a whole case based on it.

Case debate- again, this can't usually stand on its own & needs other stuff (i.e. turns).

Theory- explain, explain, explain! I am more amenable to neg theory arguments. Don't oversimplify, please!

Other things that add to your speaker points- novel approaches, good attitudes and anything that adds a little "sizzle".
Keep it friendly and light if you can and try to pretend like I'm not getting paid to listen to you.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round, if you have them.
