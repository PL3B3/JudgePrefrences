  Background:
I've been debated for a year in Parlimentary and LD debate as well been doing limited prep events Extemporaneous speaking and Impromptu

Philosophy:

I focus a lot on critical thinking and analysis, as well as how well you're able to use the evidence that you're given. I pretty much flow everything that's been said but I do not finish incomplete arguments, I particularly do not have any preferences on what types of arguments that has been made, as long as they're clearly articulated..At the end of each round I will weigh what has been. The only dislike that I have is spreading, so I would prefer if students didn't do it, especially in LD.
