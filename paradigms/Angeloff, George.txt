  I see my role being LD parent judge in providing a fair, unbiased ballot as part of the competition.
For that we still need an oral presentation with sufficient annunciation, despite all electronic devices.

I will foster healthy and productive competition by identifying the better argument based not merely on "the better card", but on logical structure supported by the necessary clash of contentions as well as the facts, all focused on the resolution.
