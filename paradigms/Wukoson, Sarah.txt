  I debated for four years at Westfield HS and 2 years at Dartmouth College. I think that I have a good understanding of the structure of most arguments, but it has been a few years since I have been involved in debate at any level. As a result of this I don’t have particularly strong feelings about any arguments, but I also don’t have any topic specific knowledge. So you can argue most things, I’m going to use the standards you give me to evaluate the round, just adjust the language that you are using to account for the fact that I will not know what some abbreviations stand for or what some organizations do without you telling me.
