  Definitions and interps, I will use whichever will promote the debate at hand.

I like policy debate to be pretty straightforward and I enjoy being told which voters are current at the END of a round.

I prefer Aff to be pretty topical.

I enjoy counterplans, make sure that they are clear and complete and specifically define how they solve. I know that seems obvious, but still-- do it so I am able to follow.

I straight up prefer in round analysis instead of prewritten.

DA at your own risk, although I love K. Bring it full circle folks, I want to know specifically why you've chosen to run that specific K.
