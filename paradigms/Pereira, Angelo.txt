  My name is Angelo Pereira I went to Coral Springs High School and I did debate for 5 years, 4 in high school and 1 in college
I placed at a lot of local tournaments and broke at some of the more prestigious ones, not that any of that is impressive just giving some background so you can understand me as a judge a little more.
I did LD for most of my debate days but in college LD is kind of lame so I did policy for a semester.

In terms of arguments everything thing is cool as long at its logical and you can defend it, not going to lie when I debated I really enjoyed K's so I might favor those types of arguments a little
more if they're structured well, but in general you can run anything (basically run trying to say lay arguments and more progressive arguments are both cool with me)

Spreading is fine with me as well just make sure to slowdown on taglines, another thing that's important to me is weighing like a want to know what means the most and which impacts are more important than others I really like the role of the ballot arguments and the standard value criterion because it gives me a really easy way to judge what's the heaviest argument.

O yeah theory is ok with me too, but not going to lie my standard for it will be a little heavier than normal judges probably, but if abuse is obvious go for it, but just know I tend to favor arguments that respond to it a little more
