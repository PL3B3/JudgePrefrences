  I did several years of debate in high school and college. I flow quick rounds easily, but will let you know if the speed is too fast. I think what you say and the arguments you choose have important implications for debate so I dislike things like racism good, spark, or trolling in general. I prefer substantial debate rather than T or framework, but will evaluate a line-by-line debate just as effectively. You probably won't out-left me. My favorites rounds have included Maya Angelou poetry and guitars. After all, the sun isn't yellow; it's chicken.
