  I have debated four years for Apple Valley High School’s LD team. The things that make me happy in round are warrants, weighing, and being a decent human being. I debated two years on the national circuit, but only competed at three bid tournaments each season. For my senior year, I decided to stay on the Minnesota locals circuit. That pretty much indicates my opinion on circuit debate.

My Favorite Things:
Well explained warrantsSaying “extend” then properly extending argumentsClearly resolved frameworkBig picture weighing in addition to engaging line-by-line
Things I Enjoy Judging:
Traditional debatePolicy (plans, CPs, DAs)
Things I Don’t Enjoy Judging:
TheoryKsFramework
Things I Hate:
TricksA priorisSkep
Things I Will Drop You For:
Justifying atrocities. Ex: genocide, rape, oppression, etc.Making the round blatantly inaccessible to your opponent.Being mean to me or your opponent. Being a sassy is totally okay. If you're not sure where something crosses the line, it probably does.
Misc.
You can read off your computer.You can sit.You can use your phone as a timer.I’ll get annoyed if flashing/email chains take more than a minute.You can spread so long as you’re clear. I’ll say clear once.
