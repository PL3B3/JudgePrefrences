2013-2017: Competed at Peninsula HS (CA)

Yes I want to be on the email chain, add me: jlebarillec@gmail.com

I primarily read LARP arguments during the regular season. At camp I experimented with everything including high theory, performance, (ethical) framework, theory, and tricks.

I am willing to judge, listen to, and vote for anything. Just explain it well.

Speed should not be an issue, but be clear.

Defaults:
Drop the argument
No RVIs
Reasonability

GREENHILL NOTES:
1. I default epistemic modesty; moral confidence must be justified and won.
2. If I shout TAGS it means that the end of your cards and the beginning of your next tags are not distinct enough.
3. If you want a better chance at winning and higher speaks start rebuttal speech with a real impact overview and not just explaining how debate works.
4. Explaining dense arguments will make me more likely to vote for them/higher speaks.

THE GAME:
There will be a posted trivia question about myself on my judge philosophy. Before each PRELIM debate each competitor may ask ONE YES/NO question to try and learn what the answer is. If you're yes/no answer correctly identifies the answer; you will earn 30 speaks for that debate. Asking order will be decided randomly.
