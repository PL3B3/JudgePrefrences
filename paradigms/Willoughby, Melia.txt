  I am very strictly a flow judge, quite simply, donâ€™t drop arguments. The easiest way to pick up my ballot is impact calculus; give me an explicit reason to vote for you as a debater. There are no arguments you can present me with that will make you instantly lose my ballot, if you can argue it well I will have no problems voting for it. As far as speed goes I going to rate myself a nine of ten, I have yet to judge a round that I had problems keeping up with. I did progressive LD for four years in high school (Lone Peak High School) and I have judged LD at national tournaments for one year. If there are any questions feel free to ask.
