Conflicts: Okoboji High School
I debated public forum and LD for Okoboji High School for 4 years, Graduated in 2011
In short, I am not the best at flowing but I can flow brisk to moderate speed. I am good with simple frameworks but slow down for denser ones. Theory is not something I am super competent with so slow down and give a clear abuse story. I like intuitive arguments that make sense on the flow and will award speaker points accordingly.
Speed: I can flow brisk to moderate speed, but I am still rusty. Donâ€™t start off at your top speed and ease in so I have time to get used to your voice. If you are reading plan text, kritikal arguments, theory interps, and really dense framework.
Framework: I am used to debate traditional LD so any basic Kantian or Utilitarian framework should be fine. If you want to run denser frameworks, be sure to slow down with the cards and important analytics and explain more in rebuttals then you would with a tab judge. I will listen to abusive burdens and vote on them if they are not contested as abusive but I need a clear ballot story when extending.
Theory: Theory is still a new concept for me, so while I am open to theory do not expect me to perfectly evaluate a theory debate especially so if it is unclear and muddled. I default to reasonability, but I am open to counter interps.
Ks: I am not well read in Ks, but I will listen to them. Be EXTREMELY slow when reading dense material such as Foucault, Derrida, Butler, etc. I like intuitive arguments and if they make sense, I will be more likely to buy them.
Ask me questions before the round and I will be glad to answer them. Good luck at the rest of the tournament!
