  My Judge Philosophy:

Honestly I will vote on anything so long as it is articulated well meaning that if you are going to run critical arguments -e.g. micropolitics, K's, Performances ect...- explain it well -in terms of how it is supposed to be applying to the round or the topic- and make sure that it is well warranted like any argument should.

Theory
I vote on theory so long as abuse is shown and the argument is well developed 

Speed
I am fine with speed and will yell clear if needed but if I couldn't hear it I am not going to vote on it


Aside from this I can clarify any specific questions you may and you can email me at: fred_ditzian@knights.ucf.edu
