  Hello. My name is Felicia. I did Lincoln Douglas Debate for two years in high school. I've judged all 3 debates since 2007. Since I occasionally judge policy, I'm fine with speed as long as you are clear. If I can't understand you, I quit flowing. Because I judge all the debates, I'm okay with any kind of style or argument but you need to impact and understand it well enough to explain it.
