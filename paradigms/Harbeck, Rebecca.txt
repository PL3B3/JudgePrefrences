Debated at Niles West High School for 3 Years Currently debating at the University of Southern CaliforniaCurrently coaching for the Harker School I'm pretty tab. While I mostly went for "critical" arguments my senior year, I also attended HSS and extended the politics DA most 1NRs. 

I value teams that make strategic 1NCs and 2NR choices and smart, innovative arguments versus teams that just try to win debates by out-carding their opponents. 

Clarity is very important. I should be able to hear every word in the card.I didn't work at a debate camp over the summer, so please explain acronyms and topic specific CPs/DAs.
