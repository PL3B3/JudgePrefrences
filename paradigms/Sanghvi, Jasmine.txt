  Parent Lay judge.

For LD: Go any faster than normal speaking tone and I'll stop flowing and probably misunderstand everything you're saying. Go slow and you'll have a judge who flows and can reasonably understand normal arguments. No Ks, Theory, DAs (unless you make the DA SUPER CLEAR and don't run extinction, and you explain what uniqueness, inherency, etc. are), Plans, counterplans, or any other type of progressive argument you could think of. Use a traditional V/VC framework structure.  

I have never judged policy before.
