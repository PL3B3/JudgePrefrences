  I believe in the traditional form of LD debate, that is, a focus on how communication affects argumentation. Debaters should recognize the human element in the room--that persuasion is an act of interaction. To that end, arguments hould be clearly connected to the value, debaters should focus on the resolution and not on 'clever' topicality criticisms. Clash is absolutely vital to persuasion and one shouldn't be afraid to disagree with purpose. And all should be done in a clear, consistent voice that is easy to follow.
