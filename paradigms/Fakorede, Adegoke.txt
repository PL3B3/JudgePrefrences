  I have debaed in Lincoln-Douglas Debate for 4 years in Science park high school. I recently graduated and I am now on the Rutgers Newark debate team. I've qualified to the TOC in both Lincoln-Douglas and Policy debate my senior Year. 
I am ok with speed. I love k's and critical arguments when they are ran corretly. 
Theory is fine with me as well as topicality but I need a realy good analysis on the violation and impacts back to standards. 
Im really ok with any argument that isnt racist, sexist, or offensive in anyway. 
I give high speaks if you are clear and really good in the big picture debate. I like a good story.
