  I have a PhD in Engineering and currently work for a National Laboratory on a mission to the international Space Station. I have judged LD for a couple of years, and truly enjoy a good debate.
1-I don't have a problem with spreading; however, I draw the line when you have to gasp and have become even incomprehensible to yourself. I will shout "clear" twice.
2-I flow everything. I consider the "CX" rounds, and pay attention to how probing your questions were, and how well your opponent responded.
3-There are no arguments that I won't vote on. I am looking for a clear explanation of the function of the argument in the round, evidence comparison, and a clear decision calculus.
4-For speaker points I don't pay attention to the quality of the argumentation: I look for fluidity, demeanor, tone and courtesy.
