        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        topical, theory, counterplans are fine -- just make sure there's clash

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        speak well

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        acts like an idiot, doesn't know what they're doing, spits when they speak

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        the one that won the round

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        kritiks

    
    
        Rate the following argument types

        Topicality: Awesome
Theory: Awesome
Counterplans: Alright
Disads: Alright
Kritiks: Don't care
Framework: Awesome
Speed/Spreading: Alright
