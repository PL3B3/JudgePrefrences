  TLDR:
Its your round, you do you.


Background:
Four years of debate at McNeil High School. One of Public Forum followed by three of Lincoln Douglas. 

Speed:
You do you. If you want me to say clear I can, but I probably won't need to, and will not, by default. 

Asking if your opponent is okay with speed is cool. 

Speaker points:
Generally given based on how well I think each person debated. Typically I'll give decent speaks to people. However, if someone is exceptionally disrespectful to their opponent (which has not happened in my experience, yet) then I will take off points.

Argumentation Generally:
You run what you would like to run. No type of argument is off the table. That said, poorly made arguments are what they are.

Theory:
Generally averse to theory, but I will evaluate and vote on it. Prefer reasonability. 

Substance:
Good.

Kritiks:
Good, if they are good (see 'Argumentation Generally' for bad kritiks). 

Flex Prep:
No different than if you handed each other copies of cases: only for clarification and will not be flowed or considered in evaluating the round. 

Ask your opponent if they are okay with it first. 

Last:
Again, If there is anything you are not comfortable with in round within reason, such as speed, please let that be known to your opponent before the round (and me if you wish) to ensure the round is as fair as it can be.
