  Background:
I competed in policy debate for 3 years and switched to LD my senior year at Lake Highland Prep. I 
graduated last year, and I am 
now 
coach in my 2nd year coaching 
LD at Lake 
Highland Prep. Highland. 


Style Paradigm:
Iâ€™m fine with speed. Road mapping and sign posting are almost essential if you want me to know where to put your arguments 
(duh.) so speaker points are definitely improved when those tools are utilized effectively, 
but I generally do not drop speaks for anything stylistic in the 
round except for excessive usage of these words: basically, um, uh, and er. That said, I am more likely to enjoy the round if the debaters are nice to each other. round. 


Argumentation:
I am not opposed to any specific types of arguments. Even if I hate the arguments, I will vote on what is in the round. A word of warning though, I have a ridiculously high threshold for theory arguments and will 
try to 
vote  anywhere  else on the flow if there is no functional abuse story or some type of justification for potential 
abuse. abuse if your opponent gives me enough leeway to do so. 
This works in the favor of a lot of debaters though because if you debate theory even moderately well and you have an abuse story, chances are you will win my ballot.
Weigh arguments. I stick to my policy background if the values debate is too muddy and will vote on whoever has bigger (or more important) impacts.
