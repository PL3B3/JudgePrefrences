I am an "old-school" LD Judge. I learned to coach LD from the coaches who first developed the event, so when NFL released the "new"guidelines for LD in October 2006, I was happy to see that the committee wants LD to return to its roots. Therefore, I offer the following paradigm for judging LD reflecting the words of the NFL LD committee: I will vote for the debater who proves his/her side of the resolution more valid by offering quality and depth of argumentation rather than mere quantity of arguments. I will vote for the debater who offers a core value and who better establishes a clear and cohesive relationship beween the argumentation and the value structure. I will vote for the debater who best addresses the central questions of the resolution and who best attacks the opponent's case and defends his/her own. I will vote for the debater who communicates in a more persuasive, clear, and professional manner and for the debater who presents arguments at a rate of speed that I can easily flow.
