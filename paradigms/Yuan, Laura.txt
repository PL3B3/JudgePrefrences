Bio: I've done a little bit of Parlidebate in college but not too much. More of my experience is focused in high school. In high school (I went to Green Valley), I did 4 years of speech and debate. I did Oratory and Duo as my main events for speech and did PF for 2.5 years before switching over for the second half of my junior and my senior year to LD. I've debated both locally (which has always been more lay) and at nationals. I've always been more of a traditional style LD debater. In terms of judging, I haven't judged debate since I left high school-- and my only other experience in terms of judging practice debates and novice rounds.

Preferences: Like I said, I've always been more traditional in terms of LD Debate. If you spread, I will ATTEMPT to understand what you are trying to say but there are NO guarantees I will catch everything. I've always been more of a lay debater (but I'll be a flow judge), but the most important thing is me being able to understand what you are trying to say-- confusing arguments that are not clear to me will not be considered as heavily as those that are very clear. That being said I'm a huge fan of hypothetical examples used as a way to make more your arguments more clear/relatable to the judge. The main things I want is everything to be very clearly laid out (ie. value, vc, arguments, counter-arguments etc.). For me: Quality > Quantity.

Please be polite-- DO NOT cut people off during cross-ex and DO NOT take up all of your opponents cross-ex time or be disrespectful. I'm a huge, huge fan of people who are polite during rounds and nothing annoys me more than people who are disrespectful to their opponents/other people in the room/ other people NOT in the room during round. That being said, I love humor-- but keep in mind the fine line between being humorous and being disrespectful to others.
