  Gulliver Prep ‘13

I was coached by Stephen Pipkin and Gus Eyzaguirre so a lot of my views on debate were influenced by them. (This isn’t comprehensive so if there’s something specific you want to know either see their philosophies or feel free to email me damintz95@gmail.com)


-Flow. Seriously, flow. I’ll deduct speaker points if I know you aren’t flowing and it’s reflected in your speeches. 

-Make sure to be clear and don’t sacrifice clarity for speed. What matters is not how many arguments you make but how many arguments I can comprehend you saying. 

-I prefer a disad/CP debate 

-Kritiks: I'm really not good for these. I find a lot of common aff args very persuastive. I also require a high level of explanation to vote on something so if I can't explain why the k means the aff is a bad idea, I'm not voting for you even if the aff doesn't answer it well. Given I read almost none of this literature, I'm starting from a fairly low knowledge base so a lot of that burden falls to you. [taken directly from Stephen Pipkin’s philosophy]

-I like T debates but you have to make sure to explain your interpretation well and make sure to impact your standards 

-Presumption goes to less change

-I don’t really have a predisposition for theoretically questionable counterplans, but you have to make sure to cover your bases well if you decide to go for it in the 2NR

-You need to tell me to kick the CP or alternative in the 2NR, or say the status quo is always a logical option for me as a judge; otherwise I will stick you to it. However, if the aff tells me not to kick the CP or alternative and has a well warranted reason why not, then I won’t. 

-I am sympathetic to conditionality debates if they are well explained and technical 

-Please do impact calc

-I am willing to grant 100% chance of defense

-Arguments do not need evidence, they just need to be well explained 

-Tech over truth 

-I will vote against you if you cheat in any way (stealing prep, clipping, etc.) 

-Be respectful (seriously, don’t be unnecessarily rude or a jerk) and have fun
