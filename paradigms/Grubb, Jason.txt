   "Who is the judge? The judge is God. Why is he God? Because he decides whether I win or lose, not my opponent." - The Great Debaters  

A few things to know about me
I never debated in high school or collegeI have philosophy degree and have taught college level philosophy coursesThis is my second year judging (I judged HS and college debate last year at a couple of tournaments)I am from the great state of Wyoming where traditional debate reigns supreme. It is what I know and what I am familiar with.Ks, Ts, CPs, TOC, progressive style, spreading - it's all foreign to meI do not like rapid delivery (anything over 200 wpm is rapid)I appreciate clear speech with well explained ideasWhat I call flowing is what you would call note takingI have a god complex, i.e., don't try to argue with me after I have reached my decision for the round even if you think I am wrong, which I won't be
I judge debate because I like judging things (and I am a supportive parent who was asked to help, but mostly because I like judging things). I have judged debate, spelling bees, cooking contests and human worth. I make judgements all day about people, events and ideas. I am an armchair quarterback and backseat driver. I never pass on an opportunity to judge and look forward to judging you.
