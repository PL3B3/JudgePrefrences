  I am a parent judge; however, I have a lot of experience from judging several debate tournaments in Parliamentry, Public Forum, and Lincoln-Douglas debate.
Berkeley may be a circuit tournament, but for you to win my ballot in preliminary rounds, you should not be spreading/talking too quickly, or running kritiks/theory/cps/plans/disads because
chances are I won't vote for you if you run those types of arguments.
I try not to be biased and see myself as an objective person, so while you should avoid running circuit arguments, feel free to run any other arguments that
are relevant to your side of the debate. Speaks and presentation are very important to me as a judge so you may want to keep that in mind in every speech.

During cross-examination, be civil to your opponents and give them a chance to respond to the questions you ask. If you are answering questions, keep
them concise so that your opponent can ask as many questions as they want to. Do not be rude in cross-examination since this will affect your speaks and
it will overall make the round an unenjoyable experience.

Also, do not run absolute/blanket statements in your framework/observations where you force the affirmative or negative to prove every single example of the resolution.
That is not what the debate calls for and is honestly unfair to whomever you run that against. You should be telling me how to evaluate the round by weighing your arguments
and telling me which arguments on the flow are most important and why I should be voting for you. I like going big-picture because of my experience in Public-Forum debate
so do not debate line-by-line on the flow. Even if you lose some arguments, but win the main argument that I buy, I'll vote for you. Strategize wisely and choose the arguments
that you know will win you the round in your voting issues. I like crystallization/impact calculous.
