Debate 3 years in high school (Open)

Philosophy on much like: Xiao, Willy 

RFD: Impact Calc in 2NR/AR + clear explanations for why 'you won the argument.'

CX: Don't mind open. Don't be rude or disrespectful. Please make sure you're asking questions.

Spreading: As long as you are clear and consistent, all is good! Read warrants/tags clearly. Clear > Speed 

Always provide a roadmap!

Personally not a big K or T fan (more into the policy of the debate), but I will try and judge as objectively as possible. If you do go for K or T, be convincing and know (or try to know) what you're talking about. Try and explain, may or may not know the argument. 
Huge fan of creative and unique Affs (Performance), but must make sense, and be argument carefully. 

Prep Time: If paperless, prep time will stop when flashdrive is ejected from computer. Try and give me a copy of the file/cards being used. 

For anything else or more specific, feel free to ask!
