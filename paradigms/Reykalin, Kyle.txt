First, I'm anti-long judging philosphies. Secondly, I’m currently not involved in debate because I’m busy pretending to be a lawyer. I have been pretending for two years now. That being said, here are the things I remember caring about:
1) I like topicality. I also like when people explain why it matters, articulate abuse or competing interpretations etc etc. Don't just run topicality because I said this.
2) I default to policy maker until someone tells me not to. I don't have any particular preference. The only rule I think is essential is the time limits on the speeches, because I don't want to hold up the entire tournament to prove that everything is arbitrary/illusory.
3) I'm fine with kritiks as long as you explain why they mean I should sign the ballot for you under some framework. I think if you're going to read a 10 page card on a kritik you should read it a little slower.
4) Same goes for pretty much any other argument- just impact it, tell me how it relates to other impacts, and why your argument is more important. This probably should be point number 1 but it's too late now.
5) Don’t be mean- I’ll still vote for you if you win but I’ll shake my head and look sad. And I’ll walk by you all the time at tournaments doing the same thing. It's ok to be jokingly mean or funny mean as long as it's friendly.
6) If you're being really unclear I might tell you to be more clear. Just be clear. I won't read cards after the round to make up for the fact that you didn't read them clearly in round.

Feel free to ask me about any of the above- or any other questions in round.
