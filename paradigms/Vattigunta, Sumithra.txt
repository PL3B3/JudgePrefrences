  My name is Sumithra Vattigunta. I am a parent who rarely judges for Suncoast.

I am a lay judge, and have judged one local tournament. Don't pref me if you want me to really, really evaluate the substance in your arguments. I cannot flow spreading. Go for the most real-world applicable arguments and really clarify the implications and role of the arguments to the ballot.I want to refrain from intervening as much as possible, so have explicit comparative analysis with your opponent's arguments. As for positions, no K's, DA's, CP's, nuanced/complex philosophical frameworks, Kritikal affs, etc. Run the most lay/traditional case you have and really articulate the argument. Good luck!
