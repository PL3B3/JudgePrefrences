  I am a parent of a high-school debater. I try to be as unbiased as I can in judging the round. A couple of comments:

- I try to be as technical as possible and will flow on my computer, keeping track of contentions that are being responded to or dropped.
- Be organized and signpost - it helps me flow and helps me track contentions across the debate. Number and use them clearly.
- I'm not really looking for persuasive (more technical) - on the other hand, I really like when someone is clearly laying out, summarizing. If you're going to do something strategic or complicated, that's fine, but realize that means a higher bar for you in terms of laying it out so I can follow it.
- Please be courteous during cross-ex - I'm not looking for who is dominating/cutting off/being louder/faster
- Have fun!
