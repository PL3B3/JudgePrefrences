  I can handle speed if you emphasize the tags. I am open to any kind of debating no matter how far out there. Performance affs, advocacy, policy, kritikal, they are all good. I particularly like high level debating with third and fourth level thinking as defined by Lou Krieger in "The Levels of Thinking in Poker" (Google it). Please only run arguments you understand well.

One last thing: I hate marking cards. If you start reading a card and it is too long, too bad, you must read it all. If you mark, I will erase the card from my flow and deduct speaker points for wasting my time. I have seen too many teams gain a tactical edge by marking many cards when running out of time.
