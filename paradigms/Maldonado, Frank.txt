  First and foremost, please please please signpost clearly, especially if you're speaking quickly. Along those lines, please slow down for taglines, and do not speak fast unless you can speak clearly. That said, I am more or less ok with speed.

In terms of casing, my tastes are pretty traditional: don't use theory unless you have to (i.e. unless there is clear abuse and you justify it well), and when you set up your case, make a clear framework, justify it, and impact your arguments back to it. Value/Value Criterion frameworks are generally my favorite, but I am ok with different ones if you explain why they're important and why they are preferable.
