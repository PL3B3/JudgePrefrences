  I debated for four years at Hopkins High School in MN.

I like interesting and substantive debate. I'd like to see arguments presented in an organized and coherent manner. I find it difficult to follow cases that are just long lists of arguments without a discernible organizational structure (contentions, advantages, etc). Don't present your arguments in a manner designed to confuse your opponent because you'll probably confuse me as well. That said, I'm open to just about any framework/standards structure as long you explain how it functions.

I don't have any problem with speed as long as it doesn't impede clarity. However, I will probably be more impressed if you win convincingly without going excessively fast. I like interesting/unconventional positions and I'll give you good speaks if you run one well. I'd prefer not to see theory as the focal point of a round, but I'm not opposed to voting on it and I understand that it's often necessary/strategic.

In general, I don't think I'm too picky. You'll probably have to do something really stupid or offensive for me to "penalize" you with speaks, but don't test that. Also, I'll try to refrain from taking out my personal insecurities on you in the round.
