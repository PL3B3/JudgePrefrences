  I have coached speech and debate for just under a decade, but most of my years of experience is with speech. I understand debate, I understand non-traditional debate, but I prefer to judge traditional cases. Treat me as you would a lay judge in order to be safe. I do not mind spreading, but if you speak so quickly that I am unable to understand you, I will have a difficult time voting for you. Also, keep to the times of the debate, I am not going to be impressed if you go over your time in a misguided attempt to make things more difficult for your opponent. If I tap my pen, it means your time is up.
