  My judging paradigm:
Basic delivery preferences (not trying to sound rude, but some debaters really need to learn how to work on these things and record themselves to see how they sound): 
1) Do NOT mumble when you read your warrants. That sounds horrible, and I will lower your speaker points. They should be read at the same volume as your tags so I can hear what your cards are saying. I'm not going to simply assume that your tags match your warrants.
NO SPREADING!!!!! YOU WILL LOSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO SPREAD

Rude Behavior:
1) Rude behavior to your opponents (i.e. snickering at them, badgering them in cx, etc.) or to myself (i.e. arguing w/ me after the round about my decision) is unacceptable. This leads to the lowering of speaker points. There is no reason for conceit or rudeness. 

DAs:
1) Effective link story is essential.
2) Don't forget to answer all turns.

Ks:
no k's
