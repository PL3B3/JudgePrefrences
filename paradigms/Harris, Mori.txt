  Hi! I debated all through out high school, starting out in PF and ending up in LD; I am definitely more of a traditional debater and am better at understanding traditional arguments. I am less comfortable with technical arguments unless they are simple to understand and are relevant, but I definitely will not base my decision on the type of arguments made more so on how you present yourself as a debater. I prefer normal speaking speeds to spreading, but if you are super super super clear and you really want to spread, go for it! (If I only get the gist of your argument, make sure you do an effective job at reiterating throughout the round). Iâ€™m really not picky in terms of speaker points, if you present yourself well (fluency/confidence) then you will be fine! If something is important in cross fire, I like to hear it brought up throughout round. I am big on logical fluency of arguments and well-warranted claims. If there is one piece of advice I have it would be to please please please be respectful to the level that your opponent is at as debate is a learning experience! Also, I think the last speeches are important for showing why you win so make sure to use the time wisely :)
