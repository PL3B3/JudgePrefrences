I am the Coach at ALJ High school, an ex-LDdebater (Bronx Science '02) and ex-policy-debater (University of Rochester '06). I flow your points but having said that I think you should be paying attention to judge reactions. If I am looking at you and not writing (yes I debated before we flowed on laptops so I write) either a) I am not understanding you or b) I am missing your point - either way it is time to move on.

I am a little old fashioned in that I think that a judge really shouldn't have to do any work to figure out where the win is. I will only vote on what you tell me to vote on. Don't expect me to go through the flow and see where arguments were dropped, what tag line went unanswered or where I think you won, I expect you to crystallize in the 2 this means: tell me where to look for you to win and why with analysis about how your opponent's arguments don't hold. Don't think you'll get the full weight of the argument by carrying tags through the round - I need substance!

I don't mind critical theory, but don't expect me to know acronyms or understand complex theory without explanation. I am a sucker for debate theory but there's a higher risk of judge intervention if you go for it because I will have to analyze whether or not the arg holds up/ has in round applicability. I pretty much wear my emotions and thoughts on my sleeve, or in my case, face. So for example if I look bored/confused/upset etc odds are that I am. If allowed by the tournament I will disclose and I will critique.

Speaker points: I almost never give 30's. I almost never give below 25. Be warned though, if you curse, put down your opponent with foul language, offend me or your opponent, act unprofessionally in any way shape or form, then your speaker points WILL be reduced and the more frequent it is, then the more points get reduced. I will not vote for someone who offends me or the activity.

Play fair and have fun!
