Ask specific questions before round.

Policy
- I can follow you at whatever speed so long as you are clear. Slowing down for tag + cite is a must. Number and letter your arguments and signpost always.
- I don't vote on theory by itself. I prefer case turns, counterplans, and disads. Ks are fine but I expect full comprehension of whatever you're running, so make sure you know your K very well.
- Regarding the topic: because of my congress background, I will probably scrutinize case - particularly solvency. on the neg, if you're running disads, when linking, be cautious of the i/l and be super clear about how aff links in and how strong the link actually is.


LD
- Same as policy for speed. but when you're explaining philosophy/ your standards, slow down. you can speed up for your case, but slow down for framework.
- Again, this is my first year judging open LD, so I'm open for any strategy/ style so long as you're clear, comprehensive, and remember, I was a congressional debater, so be persuasive but don't slack on depth in your reasonings.
- I default to NBs. While your standards are important, I also measure your case in a real world setting so make sure your solvency is practical/ doable.
