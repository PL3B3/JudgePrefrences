  I am a member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, class of 2011, trained by them in the ways of LD judging. I value arguments over presentation, and will always vote on the arguments, with preference for those arguments that flow logically, not those that rely on an appeal to authority or expertise of a source. Where presentation is concerned, I especially value clarity, and those speakers who take the time to speak both clearly and concisely instead of speaking as quickly as humanly possible in an effort to cram as much information as possible into the round will be looked upon favorably.
