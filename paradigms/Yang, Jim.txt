  This is my fourth year judging parliamentary debate as a lay judge.

Presentation:
I expect the debaters to speak clearly and not spread. If you speak too fast and I do not understand what you said, I can not consider it in weighing my decision regardless of its importance. More often than not, I take note when a debater slows down to say something as a means of emphasis, and I will take that to mean the debater thought this argument was important in the round. As such, this is the best way to connect as argument with me. 

As a courtesy, speakers should accept at least one POI from the opposing team, especially after a Plan text is read. Above all, be professional and polite.

Format:
I prefer that the government team to establish the round as a policy structure, with clear definitions and a plan, and to weighing according to a value criterion. This allows me as the judge to clearly weigh the voters. 

Winning the debate:
I value the clarity of your logic over the mumbling of cryptic, irrelevant philosophy. Using an analogy to illustrate your points is a much better approach for a judge like me. If your opponents drop an argument, don't just say they dropped it, communicate the importance and the impact of the dropped argument. I will primarily weigh the debate on the impacts of the contentions, not whether a team has more contentions. In other words, quality over quantity.

Supplement your arguments with both evidence and logic. If you can not provide logic as to why such and such evidence would be true or would happen, then I will assume you made it up. Likewise, provide evidence to back up your logical claims. I keep up with most current events, so they are the best source to reference in a debate for me.

The team with the most logical and impactful arguments will win the round.
