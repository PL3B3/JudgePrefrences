   I debated at Needham High School in Massachusetts for four years. I coach/judge for Needham High School and I compete in college debate for Lafayette College. 

 Speaks: My range is a 26 to 30. I judge it based on the level of competition at the tournament so I’m not going to give you a 30 unless you really are amazing. I look at word economy, time management, and strategy. If you are a great speaker but you don’t crystallize then you won’t get a 30 or if you make poor extensions then that will also be reflected in your speaks. I also really don’t like attitude/rudeness in CX and that will hurt your speaks. I’m really not trying to ruin your day by giving bad speaks so if you speak well I will keep it pretty high and I air on the side of rounding up. 

 Speed: I’m fine with speed but 
- You must slow down for tags and author names 
- If it’s something really important then slow down, it doesn’t have to be super slow but at least emphasize it in your speaking style if you want to make sure I get it. 
- Diction is a must. If you speak in a monotone I could hurt your speaks 
- I will yell clear if it’s a problem but only twice then it is your responsibility to adapt 

Theory: I have grown to really like theory. I see theory as a problem when people do not tell me how to evaluate it. Tell me whether I should evaluate it under a competing interp paradigm or reasonability. Tell me if I should reject the argument or the debater, or if I should vote on potential abuse and why! This is what I fall back on if nothing is specified: competing interps, reject the argument, and I will NOT vote off potential abuse unless you really show clear links to where potential abuse was. You can definitely sell me on a good RVI. 

Evidence: I usually will not ask to see cards unless you tell me to or unless there is a specific indite on evidence. If your evidence claims something I think isn’t true I will ask for it. I base my decision primarily on what happens in the round but I do not like miscut evidence. I will only reject it if your opponent brings it up but I will definitely write it on the ballot and it will be reflected in your speaks. You must have full citations for everything and if your opponent asks for cites you should give it to them. 

Critical or Non-Traditional Positions: I don’t really like these positions. I really dislike performances. That does not mean I will not vote for them. If you want me to vote for them you need these things. 
1) Must be able to explain it without using confusing rhetoric from the literature to both me and your opponent. 
2) You need to be able to extend it just like any other position. 
3) I don’t consider myself to be stupid so it is pretty reasonable for me to expect you to explain it to me so I completely understand the nuances and the implication of the position by the end of the round. I will NOT ask for your case to help me get it after the round. If I don’t know by then, you are not doing a good job running it so I will probably not vote for it at that point. A critical position that is clearly developed and run well can earn you the ballot in the same way that any other position can. You should know that I did not generally run these as a debater but I have debated against them. 

Other: 
- A priori = Not as common anymore but I will probably not vote off blippy prestandard arguments. It’ll be a tough sell for you. Well developed prestandards arguments are more likely to win a ballot but I really rather you just win an offensive argument. 

- Presumption = I generally will NOT vote off presumption especially if it’s a one sentence blip. Attached to a nuanced argument I might buy it if there really is nothing but honestly I shouldn’t need it if you are doing your job well. 

- CX is binding!!!! I do listen to CX and I will try to remember but if something is important you should bring it up in the next speech. I really hate it when people are rude in CX. I’m OK with clarification questions being asked during prep. Always stand and face me during CX. 

- Flex prep = I don’t like it. If the tournament allows it and both debaters want to do it then it’s fine. 

- Dress up for tournaments! Especially if you are in elims.
