  Debated 4 years policy for James Logan.
I really don't care what arguments you make or go for, just make sure they're clear and not offensive. I almost never ask for evidence so make sure you explain your cards and their warrants and call out when your opponent's cards are powertagged.
More specifically to each type of argument...
T/Theory-I default to competing Interpretations
K's-I'll be honest, I'm not familiar with a lot of kritiks outside of super generic ones, but that doesn't mean you can't run them. Just make sure you allocate reasonable time to explain what you're talking about.
CP's/DA's-I don't really have anything specific to say about these at all...
If you have any other questions ask me before your round.


In terms of logistics:
-Keep track of your own time. 
-No, I do not count flash time as prep time. But please don't take your time with it.
-Please don't be rude, if you're inappropriately rude towards your partner or opponent, I'll start docking your speaks regardless of how good you are.
