  OK here's the deal. I did policy debate for 4 years in high school and a semester in college. Judged Tournaments up until probably 2008 and have not been judging since. I also judged Lincoln Douglass Debate a few times at some of the national tournaments throughout california but it was not a debate I did in high school. For me my philosophy is simple, just explain what you are talking about clearly. That means if youre going to spread, be clear. If you are going to spread in front of me right now, do not go too fast as I have not judged in awhile so I may have hard time catching certain ideas so please slow down on your tags and cites. 

Policy wise:
I am not fond of the K but I will vote for it if explained properly. If I feel it was not, do not expect me to vote for it I will default to a different voting paradigm, most likely policy maker. 
-IF you expect to vote on Theory or topicality please do a good job of explaining everything clearly and slowly. a lot of times theory and topicality debates get muddled and I just wont look at it in the end.

LD:
I will vote for whatever paradigm you tell me to vote for if you clearly explain the implications, your standards and framework. 
-I know you guys spread now like Policy debaters but please slow down as I will have a hard time following everything since its been awhile.

For all debaters:
clarity: anunciate and make sure you are not going too fast I cannot understand
explain your evidence: I HATE pulling cards at the end of a round. If I have to, do not expect high speaker points. I will go off what was said in the debate so if you do not explain your evidence well, I will not consider it in the debate.

anything else feel free to ask me during the round. thanks.
