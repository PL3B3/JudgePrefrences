  Iowa City, City High School


At this point in my life, I consider myself a Policy Maker when I judge a round. I believe that the high school K debate has done a fair amount of damage to the activity as a whole, but that's not to say I don't understand that there is a time and a place for it. Please be aware that K's have links, and I would prefer they be used in response to an abusive Aff. I do not look forward to the first time a team tries to run a K-Aff in one of my rounds.

I flow
I can handle speed
I know theory
I do not take prep for flashing....I do not like how long rounds have become

As far as I can tell, those are the things debaters care about most nowadays.....

.....for everything else, please refer to what Wayne Tang has taken the time to write.
