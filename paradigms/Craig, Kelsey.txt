  
I am a stock issues judge.

I do not like much speed. I do not like Ks at all. I do not understand them and I won't vote on them. CPs must be untopical and not utopian.
I will vote on T if you prove they are untopical. I don't like to vote on Theory.

LD I view very traditionally. I want to hear a value, criteria and contentions that support the v/c.
