  Keeping it short and simple.
Please be clear and concise. I'm impartial to most things and just want a good round from everyone. No hostility, have as much fun as you can, I love laid-back manners. Be polite to your opponent, and be wary of novices when reading a case you know they may not understand. I'm a graduate of Taravella High School, and plan to become a lawyer and eventually go into politics. Etc. Etc. Enjoy the debate.
