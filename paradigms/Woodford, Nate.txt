  I am a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Philosophy and Communication and Rhetoric. I did LD debate in high school for two years and have competed in Policy Debate in college for 2 1/2 years. I am currently debating at the varsity level for the Pitt debate team.

As a judge, I prefer clarity over quantity, and warranted and detailed explanation of evidence. If you have to choose between reading a 10 second card and spending 10 seconds comparing evidence and competing claims, choose the latter.

I will evaluate Theory and Topicality first, but I have a high threshold for both arguments, and prefer a team to illustrate in round abuse. That said, if the other team drops theory or topicality, and you decide to go for it, I will probably vote on it.

I'm fine with K's and traditional policy arguments, just make sure to be clear when reading the tags and names of authors to make my flowing easier.

Above all, just debate well and be smart.
