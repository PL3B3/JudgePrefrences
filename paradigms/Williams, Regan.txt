  Hi I'm Regan. I am affiliated with Vestavia Hills High School and Opossum Hallow (Vestavia when we can not go as Vestavia)
I am fine with speed I debated for 4 years and have judged quite a bit and still have not found a speed I can not flow.
I am fine with theory i actually enjoy theory. I prefer abuse to exist but I will vote off it. I will vote on RVIs if the round is all about theory.
I will vote on Ks.
There is very little argumentation I will not vote on.
I don't like skep.
I am not a huge fan of Narratives
Roll Tide Roll!


Speaks
I usually do speaks by starting out at 27 add points if you do well subtracting points if you do badly. I will disclose speaks if asked.
