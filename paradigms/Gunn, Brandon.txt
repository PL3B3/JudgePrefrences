Debated 4 years at Washburn Rural High School 

Topicality: I enjoy a Topicality debate that is done well. I generally agree with competing interpretations, and will vote here if enough work is done. 

Theory: I feel essentially the same way about theory as I do Topicality, however reading a blippy theory block and not doing more work than that is not likely to make a theory argument very persuasive. I’m also not a big fan of spec arguments. 

Critiques: I don’t like them. Didn’t debate them much when I debated and am not well read on the literature. I have judged a few rounds on them and generally end up confused by the end. If you are planning on running them, I’m probably not a good fit for you. If you decide to read them with me in the back of the room, you have to be crystal clear on the story and on how it should function in the round.

Disads/Counterplans/Case: This is the kind of debate I most enjoy watching, and the way I debated in high school. Disads are good when run well with specific links (generic links are okay, but less compelling), and impact calculus is important. I don’t like counterplans as well as a straight up case/disad debate, but understand them and will vote on them. Case is very important, and a good case debate is fun to watch. 

Things I like: Be smart, be funny, make me smarter for having watched you debate. 

Things I dislike: Ks, nitpicky theory arguments.
