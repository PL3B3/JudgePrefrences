I have been a litigation attorney for almost 20 years including the past 12 as a state assistant Attorney General and am a former policy debater, now moonlighting as a policy coach. I won’t be wowed by speed – wow me with your intellect by making it clear you know what you’re talking about rather than just reading cards. It will be immensely helpful to me, and thus to you as I judge you, if you speak your tags and warrants clearly. I would prefer debate about the topic over meta debate, but will prefer logic over all. In the end I'll vote for whatever wins on the flow.
