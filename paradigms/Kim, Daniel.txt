Feel free to go for any arguments as long as you explain and impact them. Generally speaking I'm fine with any arguments as long as they are warranted and relevant jargon is explained (mostly with K's but also with super specific CP's, DA's, etc.) Also I haven't judged many rounds this year or had much exposure to this topic so you will need to be clear with acronyms, terms, other things I need to understand. As a debater, I always preferred CP/DA/case debates but that was more of a personal thing as a 2N. Kritiks are good; if they're really out there, just make it as clear as possible. I like affs with a plan but whatever you want to do is fine as long as it's related to the topic. Topicality is great, just keep it relevant and not just as a throw-away off case. Though I prefer substantive debates over theory 2NR/2AR's, if they're extended/legitimate, I'll vote on it. Obviously, don't cheat, be friendly to each other. CX should be fun and civil; it's important for speaker points too. Open CX is all good. So is paperless. Make the debate a good time; engage intellectually and as people. If you have any questions, ask away.
