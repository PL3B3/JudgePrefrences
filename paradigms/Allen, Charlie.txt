  Preference for good argument and sound logic over a battle of evidence. Also a strong preference for substantive engagement with your opponent rather than taking the debate to a meta-level and ignoring what they are actually saying. I'm looking for debaters to convince me 1) what I should care about and why; and 2) why your side wins on those points.
