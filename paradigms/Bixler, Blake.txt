  This isn't a bio for Ok Cupid so I won't treat it like one. 

I debated in the local Kansas City area for 4 years, competing mostly in Public Forum with some experience in LD. If you are reading this, most likely I will be your judge in Public Forum. 

Here are my preferences:

1) I attempt to stay connected to my local team so you can expect that I will have background knowledge on the topic. 

2) I don't mind if you speak fast in an attempt to save time, just make it manageable.

3) USE A ROADMAP. You flow your opponent's case for a reason. Act like you know what you're doing. 

4) When it comes down to either hard evidence vs a basic assumption, I will ALWAYS vote in favor of the evidence. 

5) Most importantly for me, be respectful to your opponents. If your opponent says something that you disagree, don't make a face with a whine. That's pathetic and won't work. Don't assume that I will simply give you the round if they make a mistake. It is your responsibility to persuade me over. 

That's about it. If I am your judge and you have a more specific questions, ask me in person beforehand. Live Long and Prosper.
