  My judging philosophy is very simple: argue a focused and concise point, and you will win the debate. In LD, I like to see that debators understand the arguments they are making, so students should take care to explore an appropriate concept if it is relevant to their argument. I am also not a fan of spreading; although if a debator happens to spread and make a coherent and relevant argument, I will still give the win to the debator.
