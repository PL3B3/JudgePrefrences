  Most of my judging experience has come from policy. I am familiar with policy-style arguments (plans, counterplans, Ks, theory, etc) but if you are running those arguments, you need to clearly explain how they function in an LD round. As long as you explain how I should adjudicate the round, I am interested in seeing those positions and I will vote on them.
I am comfortable with speed. 
I have a degree in philosophy, and I understand and enjoy philosophy-heavy positions as well as more technical ones. 
If you have specific questions about anything else, feel free to ask me before the round.
