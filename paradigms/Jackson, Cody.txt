  I did LD in High School and qualified for the 2014 NFL National Tournament in that event. As for my policy experience, I didn't do policy in HS but I do LD in college which is very much Mini-policy so I do understand the terms and the debate. I also enjoy different types of arguments so I will let almost any position fly

Speed: I don't mind how fast you go, however if I don't get something because of your speed that's on you.

LD Voting: I am very squirrelly in that I vote off almost anything and everything, therefore if you want me to look at certain places and vote there then give me VOTERS
(I vote there the most often). If no voters are given the other areas I tend to look towards framework most often.

Policy: in policy I like good voters and Impact calc (tell me who has more weight in the round). If you run a K make it clear what the you want to do with it and Critical Affs are a big No-No for me. I weigh procedurals such as T's in a moderate way but it is up to the side presenting them to prove the point to me
