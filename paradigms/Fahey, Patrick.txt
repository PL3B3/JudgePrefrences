  Fahey, Patrick

I am affiliated with Ben Franklin Sean Fahey. I’m a debate father and don’t have the first-hand experience that ex-debaters have. I won’t kill your speaks if you talk faster but try not to spread or it just won’t get on to the flow. I will flow, I may ask for evidence. Try and stray away from theory or other forms of pre-fiat argumentation unless you know you can a) be clear about it and b) have some real story/in round abuse that I, someone who never did debate and doesn't fully understand some of its intricacies, can be compelled by - I probably won't vote on your 5 reasons for Affirmative Framework Choice or Disclosure Theory, sorry. I really just want to be able to vote on arguments that have been clearly extended and weighed well, if the round is mottled then so will the RFD and you may not get the result you want/expect. Feel free to ask questions before the round.
