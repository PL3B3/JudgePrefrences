  Parent judge. I've judged rounds in the past and am familiar with LD debate but an obviously not the best judge you'll ever have. I haven't judged anything this year and don't have much background on the ND12 topic. I'll remain as unbiased as I can when judging. I won't vote on kritikal stuff or really dumb theory so don't bother reading it. Whoever convinces me that their advocacy is better is the one who'll win the debate.
