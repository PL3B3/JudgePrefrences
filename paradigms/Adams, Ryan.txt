Former Los Alamos High School Debater (4 years). After recieving a degree in Economics and an MBA I now coach policy debate at Los Alamos (4 years).

I have judged mainly practice rounds on the ocean topic.
General Notes:
Disads - Yup. Not much you say other than if you are running one I expect a polished link story and impact comparisons.
Counter Plans - really like them, but I especially love country plan theory. Process, conditional, delay, word pic, are all fine assuming you can win the theory side of the debate.
Kritiks - love them when they are done well. Really enjoy good kritik frameworks, and unique and interesting permutations and answers. Generally dislike pure rejection alts, need a tangible alternative.
Theory / T - fine with it, but don't expect me to stay interested if your strat is 9 off all on T.
Performance - Fine by me as long as it can be related to the topic.
Things I dislike:
Evasive Cross-x get to the point defend your position. Don't be rude.
Role of the ballot - find that these are generally a disservice to the advocacy, are generic, and boring.
Back file checks- Don't waste my time.
I'm not thrilled about some of the current trends in K in policy debate. I want to see a solid, policy debate that ties to the stock issues in the round.
