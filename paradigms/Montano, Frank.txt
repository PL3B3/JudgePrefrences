  I am the former Columbia University coach and currently assisting with Fresno State. I haven't judged on the high school topic this year, only college tournaments.

- If I am judging your round, you probably already know me or one of your coaches knows me and you will have an idea of how to pick up my ballot. For those of you that don't and those of you that need a refresher, here goes. First of all, I don't do this full time. I have a job in corporate America and do this for fun and because I value the skills that can be learned in this activity. So please try to make this fun for everyone because I hate going back to work on Monday thinking I wasted my weekend.
Now the part you wanted: 
-Do what your good at. (I know everyone says this, but I hate hate hate when teams over adapt to me and suck). I may prefer to hear certain arguments over other ones, but I rather hear you doing what you do best even if the argument isn't one I particularly like. 
- I have empirically rewarded gutsy 2NR/2AR strategic choices with very high speaker points. If you think that a small set of arguments will unquestionably win you the debate (for example, a damning concession) and you close all of the doors properly, I will happily vote for you. You will get higher speaker points for a concise, to-the-point speech made in 3 minutes than a speech where you rant and rave needlessly until the timer beeps.
- Don't assume I know your DA scenario, acronyms, or K jargon; err towards explanation
- Your claim needs a warrant and an impact; otherwise it won't count as an argument. 

- Strategy > Truth over Tech. 

- In-Round Persuasion/Spin > "Read this evidence after the round". 

- You can convince me to pull the trigger on terminal defense or presumption. 

- My facial expressions are obvious--take a hint. 

- I can enjoy a K or performance debate, but I don't enjoy them so much that I hack for them without a basic standard of explanation and refutation. 
- I have an absurd enjoyment for well-executed impact turn debates in almost any situation (1AC impacts, DAs, Ks, etc). Just take care not to double turn yourself. 
-I give good speaker points most of the time (usually way above the average and usually way more than you probably deserve). 
-I will vote on T/FW- but I will also vote for nontopical Affs. Just win your arg.
-I won't read a lot of cards after the round. If I do, it will be just to confirm that the card said what you said. 
- If I drop you-- please don't argue with me. Deal with it. Asking for clarification is fine, but if you start arguing with me or if your coach comes in and starts, I'll walk out. In order to deter this, I will not put in the speaker points until after the RFD, and if you argue with me, your points go down. 
Have fun and if you have any questions, just ask.
