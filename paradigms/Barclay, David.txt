Sparingly judged since 2015.

Speed: Speed is fine, but I'm not as used to it. 3-4 words per second is probably fine. I will clear.

Weighing: I tend to look at big picture rather than line by line. Actually providing analysis to make your impacts clear will make it a very easy ballot. Choosing to go for line by line singularly will also make it an easy ballot.

Tech: Used them all, do whatever you want. If you or the argument isn't clear, it won't be flowed well and I will have a hard time following it. I'm okay with dense cases but not making it clear (sometimes excruciatingly) during rebuttals will make it hard for me to vote. Again, big picture.

Anything else: Ask me in before the round. I won't bite.
