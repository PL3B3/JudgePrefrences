  I was an LD debater for 3 years. My judging paradigm consists of debaters making clear arguments regarding the resolution and defending them until the end of the debate. Big fan of philosophical debate, not just stats etc. 

Speaker points are based on professionalism, common courtesy, eye contact and clarity. 

I do not appreciate debaters who turn LD a one man Policy debate round.
