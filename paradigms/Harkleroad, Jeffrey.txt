This year I've judged the Ohio Valley Invitational (University of Kentucky), John Fee/Curtis Brown Swing (Berea College/University of the Cumberlands), Transylvania U.'s WYRD Invitational, Kentucky Forensics Association annual tournament. I have been a hired judged through the University of Kentucky debate office. I've also been a hired judge through Transylvania University (Lexington, KY) since 1992. I prefer that debaters really "write my ballot" for me and make very clear what the primary decision calculus mechanism is in the round, and how they win under it. Please feel free to ask questions about specific preferences before the round.
