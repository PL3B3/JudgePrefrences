  I am the Director of Arts at University School of Nova Southeastern University. Prior to this I served as Director of Forensics at University School, North Broward Prep, Milton Academy and Hopkins! I am also the Executive Director of Summit Debate Enterprises which is home to the National Debate Forum. 

In LD Debate I want there to be direct clash, strong standards debate and clarity in your delivery. I will flow extensively; however, you need to be clear if you speak faster. 

Please ask any questions you have before the round.
