  I am mostly a public forum coach and a PF/IE judge but we have recently expanded our team to include more LD debate. I have judged LD on the local Alabama circuit when necessary, but I am brand new to the national circuit. I am uncomfortable with extreme speed and unfamiliar with theory arguments. I prefer traditional Value/Criterion Lincoln Douglas debate at a reasonable speed. However, speed, theory, kritiks, etc. will not automatically lose you the round if you are clear. My debaters have helped me to better understand these elements of LD debate, but keep in mind that Iâ€™ve rarely seen these types of arguments in a debate round and I am not very comfortable critiquing them.
