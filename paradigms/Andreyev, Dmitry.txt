A thorough proponent of clarity, my temperamental preference is to an argument that is direct and novel. I agree with Einstein, in many respects, that if one cannot explain one's theory to a five-year-old, it is of no good. I am speaking hyperbolically, of course, but I express an ideal to strive for.

I am most moved by individuals who can produce novel insights, as opposed to belabouring a popular point ad nauseum. This is not to say that old points cannot be of relevance, so long as it is applied in a novel fashion. Good arguments will cover multiple fronts at once, making something evident not only because it is logical but because its logic conforms to an underlying truth, if such a thing exists. My ideal debater is one who is struck with the overwhelming relevance of a certain subconscious truth and manages to channel the flame of conviction with a cool head, representing the apparent reality of a situation with the artful manipulation of symbols.

Perhaps my family's background in biochemistry is apparent in this prejudice. I am here as much to learn from the students about alternate modes of thinking as I am to judge. My values will change with experience judging.

Excessive attention to detail can be neurotic. A skilled debater will know when to resist this temptation when it would mire the progress of the debate. A proficient debate leaves people involved and their audience feeling informed and enlightened rather than confounded and perplexed.
