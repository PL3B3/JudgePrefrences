  Towson University/BUDL

For starters: I have 10 years of debate experience. I debated at Towson University for 4 years and coached there for 2 years. I HAVE NOT judged a competitive debate in 2 years. I however, have worked debate camps in those two years and have done research on this years topic for camp. I have been involved with debate during the last 2 years but it has mostly been administratively.

Now to the specifics (short and sweet):

There are things that personally I might not agree with but I am always open to anything that debaters have to say because I believe that these debate rounds belong to the debaters and not to me. I have chosen to write summarizing statements about the way I judge because with limited time to prep for debates, teams shouldn't waste a bunch of time having to read my philosophy.

With that said this is how I typically view debate rounds:

1) I evaluate the debate based off of the arguments in the round. Regardless of the method used to present the argument it must be explained; clash and engagement is a must.
2) I expect debaters to show respect to each other, being overly aggressive and rude will not win me over. There is a fine line between being confident and being rude, walk this line very carefully.
3) I will listen and evaluate any type of argument: kritiks, counter-plans, disadvantages and even topicality. I'm not the biggest fan of topicality or other procedurals but I will and have voted for them.
4) Theory is good on two conditions: a. it is well explained and impacted, b. it is not done at top speed and blippy.
5) Clarity is more important than speed. I have been away for awhile so debaters can go fast but they should BUILD up to their fastest not start at their fastest right out of the gate.
6) Impact analysis/comparison is a must. I love "even if" statements.
7) I like smart debaters. People who make choices and defend those choices.

Good luck and have fun!
