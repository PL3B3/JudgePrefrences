Background:Lawyer who debated Lincoln Douglas in High School at Houston-Memorial.Debated policy at George Washington University, including attending on a partial debate scholarship.Graduated with honors from American University, Washington College of Law and was in first year moot court competition there.Professionally, worked for the US Government, Law Firms, Corporations, and Trade Association in policy advocacy.Philosophy for Lincoln Douglas:Persuasive arguments is the key.Make sensible, logical arguments.Do not drop other sides' arguments even in LD. This is a pet peeve of mine.Be organized in the presentation i.e. do not be all over the place. Structure is very important in arguments.You need to tell me how to evaluate the debate and not assume I will do it for you.Philosophy for Policy:Tabula Rasa. I let the debaters decide. I can handle speed but you must be clear. If I can't understand the spew; I will not be able to count your arguments. If I put my pen down that means you are not conveying clearly and you need to clarify and enunciate.If you counterplan, the debate will probably come down to the merits of the counterplan relative to the plan so be very clear in final rebuttals on disads/ads. Tell a story at the end on the whole debate.You need to tell me how to evaluate the debate and not assume I will do it for you.
