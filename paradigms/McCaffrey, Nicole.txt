  About me:
 I did 4 years of Parli and 2 of impromptu speech in high school (2006-2010)I have some experience judging LDCurrently a senior at UC Berkeley studying Chemical EngineeringI am a few years removed from the tournament scene so please explain any technical jargon I may be unfamiliar with/have forgotten.
Preferences:
 I am a flow judge.
 If you drop any of your opponent’s arguments it will be counted against you.
Don’t spread.
Remember that your job is to convince me that you should win the round, which is only possible if I can understand what you are saying.
Be respectful of your opponents and of any individuals or groups you reference in your case.
Refrain from hurtful generalizations and personal attacks.
Organization is key.
 Make it clear what contention you are presenting or rebutting (I like numbers) and try not to jump around. Roadmapping is ok, but not really necessary—it won’t gain you any points but I won’t count it against you either.
Anything goes.
I check all my personal values and prior knowledge at the door. The only facts and values I will use to judge the round are the ones you present to me—don’t assume that I will consider something (caveat: I’m not a fan of snowballing. If any of your contentions involve the end of the world you’d better have some solid evidence backing that up.)
