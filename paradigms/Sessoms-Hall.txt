  I debated for James C. Enochs H.S. in California for 3 years. I competed mostly in state but more nationally during my last two years. 

In general, I prefer to see substantive debates where the topic is actually debated. I'm not the biggest fan of theory but if you do it well without abuse/to point out abuse, that's up to you. I'll vote for it if it's presented well. Ultimately, you set the parameters of the debate. If your framework is clear, I'll vote within it. 

And for that reason, my number one is that you're clear. I'm a flow judge therefore if I'm not flowing, you're probably talking too fast. Be reasonable with your pace. If you want/need in-round cues, I'll provide. 

Be sure to present and argue your position. Don't just read your case-that won't get you my vote. Connect your arguments and weigh them. It's one thing to be a well-spoken and persuasive speaker. It's another thing to be a good debater. 

I'll accept and vote on just about any framework (as long as it isn't offensive) if your present it clearly.
