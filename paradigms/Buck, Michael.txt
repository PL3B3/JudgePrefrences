  I have been coaching LD for two years and Congress for three years.

When judging, I look for arguments that have clear connections to your value. Your contentions should have a strong linkage to your value and should be supported with reliable and timely sources. Additionally, your philosophical citations should support your value without question. I place great importance on clarity and decorum during rounds.
