  My debate experience was long ago at a university in Ohio (Wright State) as a political science major. Since then I have done public speaking on countless occasions for a variety of organizations and as an officer for a trade association in Miami and Washington D.C. Also, in the early days I worked as an actor and for 25+ years specialized in voice-overs.

I tell you all that to say that presentation is key. I guess it's because of my background that style is important. As the example said "engagement" is critical. A clear, concise, well-documented argument is also important. I don't have any patience for rambling statements.

Another critical factor for me is the respect the speaker has for the opponent and the judges.
