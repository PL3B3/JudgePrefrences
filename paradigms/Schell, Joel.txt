  I've coached since 1993 and still appreciate a great debate.

Speed is fine as long as it's clear. Not just the tag but the actual evidence as well, since that's what I'll weigh. If the speaker is not clear, I'll say 'clearer' once. If ignored, I just don't weigh the evidence.

I still like LD Debate to be value debate and therefore appreciate arguments that flow through the value/criteria structures. I also like value clash that consists of some actual contrasting of the values offered.
