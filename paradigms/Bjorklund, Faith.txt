Please strike me if you spread, because I will NOT be able to understand or flow you. And then I will probably give the win to your opponent, which will make you sad. I am most familiar with the value/value criterion model. I will make a better decision if the framework is really clear. If you are going to do anything policy-ish, rate me low because I am not familiar with policy. DO NOT RUN THEORY-I find this incredibly annoying. Also I see theory as a call for judge intervention, so if you run it, you probably won't be happy with the decision. I value politeness and professionalism in a round. I vote off of the flow, so go line by line if you can.
