  I debated Varsity Policy in Idaho at a high school level for about two years, and then I did Public Forum for about two years. Currently I do not debate in college. I've been judging for about one year. I am very tabs about how I view debate; any argument is acceptable. Impact analysis is critical. Spread as fast as you want, just slow down on the tags. For K's; while I know some of the lit, I am not terribly knowledged in some of it (an example would be Foucault), so explanation would be lovely. I'm also able to follow CPs, although I haven't heard a single one this year, which is odd. I'd be excited to see one at this tournament. Just run whatever you think will win and explain it well - I will be able to follow and understand you if you're good.
