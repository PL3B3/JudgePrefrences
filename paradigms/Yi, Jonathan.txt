  I am affiliated with duPont Manual High School's David Yi.

I am new to judging. With that said, I am inexperienced, however I will listen to any well warranted argument that is thoroughly explained. Tell me why an argument matters. Please be organized.

I can take speed, however, there is a distinction between speedy and clear. If you want to go fast AND you want good speaks, just be really clear and tell me where you are on the flow.

Contact me a jjyi101@gmail.com or find me on Facebook at Jonathan Yi if you have any questions.
