  Hi! My name is Susie Budowsky, and I'm a parent judge. My daughter does LD.

Style
I understand traditional LD, and will weigh under winning frameworks. If you run a progressive argument, I can't guarantee that I will be able to understand it or weigh it properly, so it's in your best interest to just stick with more traditional arguments. That doesn't limit you to stock arguments by any means, but just keep the arguments within the realm of traditional. It would help you (and me) if you were to explain your arguments a bit, but it's not essential, and chances are that if it's within the realm of traditional argumentation I'll understand it.

Speed
Please don't spread. I probably won't understand you, and if I can't hear your argument there's no way that I'll be able to consider it in my decision. I prefer slower speaking, but as long as I can understand you and you're not spreading things should be pretty good.

Disclosure
I usually don't disclose anything about the round. What you need to know will be on the ballot. That includes the decision, critiques, and speaker points.
