  I debated for WDM Valley (graduated in 2013); I coached Valley and taught at NSD, VBI, and CDI.

Spring 2018 Update:
I haven't judged in over a year and I'm not coaching anymore, so I don't have in-depth knowledge about the topics
Also, I don't know what the latest trends are in terms of theory, frameworks, Ks, tech, jargon, etc.


General preferences (not sure if they're all relevant anymore with current trends):
Weighing and explaining how arguments function in the round should be your top priority. Slow down on spikes and blips. I won't vote on something I don't understand. Critical arguments are not a good idea in front of me, so just avoid reading Ks at all. Policy style arguments are totally fine, but I rarely ran them and I feel like I'm not as up-to-date about the world as you are, so keep in mind that I'm not a great judge if you want to have a super high level util debate.
On theory, I default to competing interps, no RVIs, and drop the argument, but I would strongly suggest making the arguments for whichever way you choose to frame the theory debate anyway. I don't like AFC justifying your interp, disclosure theory, flashing theory, new theory in the 2AR, and especially shells where I can't verify the violation. Don't ask your opponent to defend something in CX and then run theory on them. 
These might be outdated preferences, so if you have specific questions- please ask! Please be nice to each other!
