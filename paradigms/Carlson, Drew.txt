  I am affiliated with Centennial High School in Boise, Idaho.
Spark Notes (Read this):
In a word, I'm tab. But you should know that's a lie--everyone has biases.

Be nice, or at least not mean. Note how this is at the top.

I've judged almost no rounds on the space topic.

I debated 4 years in High School, and 1 in college (University of Arizona).

Spreading is fine. In the unlikely event I can't follow you, I will let you know.

I usually view rounds as offense/defense, unless convinced otherwise.

I have a neutral attitude toward the K.

I have almost certainly heard your K before, but assume I haven't and explain it as such. That does not mean "assume I'm stupid."

I love good case debate. Other than that, I'm pretty impartial on the various negative strategies.

If a theory debate is close, I probably won't pull the trigger unless it is the only issue in the round.

I default to competing interpretations on T unless convinced otherwise.

I think PICs are fine unless convinced otherwise.

I'm open to performance, but have very little experience with it and am probably not a good judge for a performance team.

Less important but still relevant stuff (Read this if you want, I won't hate you if you don't):

K's don't necessarily need a status--you can look into this issue elsewhere. Don't just say "it doesn't need a status" when asked about it in CX if you can't articulate why.

Warrants are more important than quals, even if the only qual is a "person in this round."

I did paperless debate in college, and was pretty bad at it. Prep runs until the flash drive or viewing laptop is given to the other team. If you abuse it at all, you will face my wrath.
