  My experience is in judging NOVICE LD at Northeast tournaments.

I should be placed in the NOVICE OR JV DIVISION as a judge.

Please signpost. 
Please speak slowly and clearly. I will yell clear/louder twice if I have trouble understanding you before it affects your speaker points. 
The better the speaker, the better I understand.
Please time yourselves.
I would rather not hear debates on theory.
