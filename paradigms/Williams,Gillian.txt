  I've competed in high school and college many moons ago and have judged for over 10 years (hired). 
Generally when I'm asked in a round about my philosophy I'm quick to say present the argument you came prepared to present but there are things that matter to me. I feel that as a judge it's my job to be flexible and open to the competitors (so not the thoughts of some others that judge). 

You can go as fast as you can but you'd better be sure I'll understand you and I loathe a competitor going in when they are in a round with someone that is not as experienced. Don't pepper me with a bunch of lingo- while I'm in this community jargon means different things for different people. Be clear, concise and succinct. Be funny and clever, have good ethos. Be good at cross-x and I love direct clash but don't be an a-hat...that'll ensure that you won't get good speaker points. I will admit I give good speaker points when the argument is smoothly given and shows polish and clever and sharp. 

Tell me what I should vote on, draw logical conclusions and give good synthesis of arguments , draw logical conclusions and that will make me happy.
