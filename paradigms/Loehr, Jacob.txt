  I debated at UTD for 4 years. We were considered a "flex" team. 

My only real guiding principal is that debate rounds are about the arguments debaters make. I do not think judges should attempt to bias or skew decisions based on personal leaning about an argument. Debate is inherently about how the debaters make arguments. 

T: Can be good or bad. The primary thing is to impact out whatever direction you choose to go.

DA: These are also pretty cool. Make sure you have a cogent link story more than anything.

CP: Was a 2A so I tend to think about CP's and CP competition more like a 2A. I don't think its my job to define what CP's are abusive or not so your theory arguments matter, try and make them a little more nuanced.

K: Read some lit, haven't read a lot of lit so don't make an assumption that I know your buzzwords.
