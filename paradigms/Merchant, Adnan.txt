  My name is Adnan Merchant. I graduated last year (2007) from Grapevine High School as the President of the debate team. I did LD debate for my entire high school career as well asextemporaneous speaking.

In regards to the round, I'm open to everything although I prefer importance be set to the standards debate. However, that being said, in debate anything goes, which means if you do not have a value or criterion, its okay. Theory debate (including K's) has its uses, which means you shouldn't use it for the sake of using it, but if you use it correctly, it will definitely serve your advantage. Speed is not a problem, but I beleive its always better to sound like a politician. In my opinion, you must do two things to secure the round: first, tell me why you're not losing the round; and second, tell me why you're winning the round.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask before the round.
