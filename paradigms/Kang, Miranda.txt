Yes, add me to the email chain, feel free to email me questions after round.

Topic Update: 
Whatever topic you're debating, I know nothing about it. Adjust accordingly, like using a full phrase once before you start throwing around topic acronyms.

Policy/Parli/LD/etc: 
Speed is fine. Arguments are arguments-- my views don't change when the debate format changes. This also means time yourselves, because I mix up all these speech formats.

Paradigm: 
I try to consider myself tabula rasa, so feel free to read anything in front of me. I vote on the line by line: if an argument is well warranted and impacted, then I’ll be willing to vote for it. So even if you think their CP/K/Theory arg is terrible, answer it, then call it terrible.Good: organized debates that are easy to flow, good jokes, clarityBad: messy debates where I could find Waldo more easily than the uniqueness you read on the wrong flow, rudeness to opponents/partner/me, reading analytics faster than you read cardsPrep time stops when the flash drive leaves your computer/you hit send, with an exception for novice debate. Tag team CX is fine.I prefer to not call up cards. The bottom of ballot states to vote for the team that ‘did the better debating,’ not who has the better evidence. Bad card with incredible explanation > great card that is not explained or warranted.
Feel free to ask me anything else before the round starts.
