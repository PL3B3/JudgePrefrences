During high school, I participated in LD Debate for two years and was an officer for our team. Now, I attend UT Dallas, and although I no longer debate I participate in Model United Nations and Mock Trial.

Enough about me, I am all about clear, well thought out ideas. Don’t overwhelm yourself and try to make too many points. Every idea needs to be sufficiently supported.

Speed is not always your friend, especially if you get to the point that I can barely understand you or can’t keep up and note what you are saying.

Be good on your feet and personable. I want to know that you didn’t just memorize or read me a paper. Don’t just ignore your opponent’s attacks just because you were not prepared for them. I’d rather you say something without proof than let them win the point without a counterargument.
