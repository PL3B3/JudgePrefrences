  I am a parent judge with very little judging experience. Therefore, the most important thing to me in the round is persuasion. I will vote for the team that makes the better arguments and convinces me that they have the better interpretation and overall knowledge of the topic.

Absolutely NO SPREADING. I cannot follow fast and will tell you to slow down. If you continue to be fast, I will not be able to follow your arguments, I will not understand what you say, and I will not vote for you. 

Keep the arguments as simple and clear as possible. NO Kritiks or theory arguments. I am fine with topicality, counterplans, and disadvantages, but make sure to explain these arguments VERY clearly - if I don't understand the argument, I won't vote off it. Also, refrain from debate jargon (eg. uniqueness, internal link, and link) because I will not understand that. 

Keep it slow, logical, and interesting. Make sure you make strong analytics and compare evidence. Make sure to tell me what the voting issues are and why you've won them.
