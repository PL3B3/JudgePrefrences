I was an LD debater in high school and briefly in college. I currently sponsor the middle school debate club at my school.

I focus primarily on a team's ability to create a cogent argument with strong, researched, and well delivered support. I tend to side with the team best able to prove their argument and evidence supercede those posed by the opposition. I am keenly aware of the difference between strategy and quality argumentation; decorum and quality are valued moreso than quantity and bravado.
