  Experience:
· 3 total years of Parli, experience in NFA-LD, and judging HS CX and HS LD
Default Judging:
· I can flow speed. Open your mouth when you talk.
· I weigh the round in terms of offense + defense (terminal offense and defense)- Meaning defense won't win you the round but may stop the other side from outweighing your offense.
Counterplan:
· I'll buy any CP and any theory you run. I may think it's dumb, but i'll pick it up.
Kritiks:
· I'm familiar with lit specific to Affropessimism, Nietzsche, Deleuze and Guattarri, Deleuze, Fem, Baudrillard, Taoism, Queer Theory (some), Borders, Marx, Heidegger, Schopenhauer, Security, Militarism, Threat Con, Biopower etc.

· Performances are cool

Topicality:
· I think defaulting to reasonability is bad for debate: competing interpretations that are unrefuted (and you tell me why I should prefer them) are generally what I will default to.
· Potential abuse is enough.
Non-topical Affs:
· You don't have to affirm the res
Speaker Points:
· Most of your speaker points come from tag lining and clarity.
· I average at 27.3
· Be polite, there's a difference between personal attacks and identity politics.
· Humor is cool, meme references are better.
