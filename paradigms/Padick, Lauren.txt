  Debated for four years for Granada Hills, enjoy classic LD-style debate. Don't care if you come from Parli/Policy background, can handle speed, but please only do it if you can do it well. As in, no slurring. Like to see clash, value debate, a little philosophy in there. Remember, Lincoln-Douglas is both a philosophical and empirical debate, so try to show me how both are on your side. I can't make any arguments for you, so please crystallize and extend throughout the round as I can only judge off what i'm left with by the last speech. Attacking each other's cards, unless you can show how the card is totally unfounded, is pointless to me.

Overall, try to have fun! Best of luck.
