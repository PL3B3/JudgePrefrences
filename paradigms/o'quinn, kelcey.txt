read what you desire, and i will do my best to evaluate the arguments without bias. impact your arguments and contextualize them within the round,

i graduated from churchill high school in 2007 and read mostly critical arguments. i prefer these debates, but will vote on anything. i have not judged on this topic yet, so be really clear what your acronyms mean..
