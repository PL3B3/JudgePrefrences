  I have judged mostly LD with a couple of PF and Policy rounds. I was introduced to Forensics last year so I am relatively new. I look for evidence that is presented in a clear and organized manner. The person who presents their argument with evidence clearly and can defend their position will score better than a person who is unorganized. Getting the message across is important because in life there will be misunderstandings that could be avoided if the message is organized and presented well. If someone can explain something well then I believe that person truly understands the issue on both sides of the argument. Delivery and tempo of the speech should be quick but not to the point where I can't understand the words. Cross-examination shows if they are prepared or anticipated the question. It also indicated what level of insight they have regarding the topic.
