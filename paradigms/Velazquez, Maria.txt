  Judging Philosophy: 

First and foremost I expect debaters to respect one another throughout the round. Failure to do so will result in low speakers points (especially in the case when an experienced debater is disrespectful towards a debater with less experience). 

Voting- I tend to vote on Stock Issues but you can persuade me to vote differently. In your last speech I also prefer that you remind me as to why I should vote for you. For example bring up any dropped arguments, why your impacts outweigh, magnitude, timeline, etc. 

Speed- No spreading! 

Evidence/Argumentation-I prefer case-specific disadvantages vs. general ones. I also take into consideration the quality of evidence and analysis of it. 

Time-I will time you but I also expect you to time yourself. During prep time I will let you know how much time you have left (30 second intervals).
