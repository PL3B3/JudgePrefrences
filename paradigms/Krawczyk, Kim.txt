  Conflicts: Coral Springs High

I am a parent who has been judging LD for about 2 years. I can't really understand spreading all that well and find theory a bit ridiculous, but I'll try to be open to whatever arguments you throw at me.

Be very clear with any arguments you make, and be sure to explain them in depth. I am not familiar with any of literature read "on the circuit" so it's your job to make sure I understand your case.

CX should be a time to catch the flaws of your opponents case with tough questions, not a time to beat your opponent down and continuously interrupt them.

Rebuttal speeches need to have some weighing. If you want me to vote on certain arguments, you need to be showing me which arguments to vote on and how those arguments mean an aff/neg ballot.

I use speaker points to reward people for being nice, speaking slowly and clearly, and making smart or unique arguments.
