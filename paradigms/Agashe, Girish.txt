I evaluate the truth and the falsity of the resolution. That means that ranting about the incapability to evaluate justice is probably not the best way to debate in front of me. A few things, I am a parent judge, father of a third year debater so I don’t have the experience you might hope for, but I will flow (or attempt to dependent on your lack of clarity). I don’t understand theory, or how to evaluate it so don’t bother to run it. If an a priori issue makes sense I’ll consider it but usually these issues are unwarranted and an excuse to negate, not good arguments.
