  I am a first year graduate student in Communication Studies at Cal State Northridge. I am currently one of the Assistant Coaches on the Matador Speech and Debate Team. I have been involved with the speech and debate community for over five years. I have taught argumentation and I have judged policy debates.
 
In terms of my judging philosophy, I ask that debaters clearly explain their arguments, so watch your speed. I am not too comfortable with speed reading and jargon since my exposure to policy debate has been limited. This means that debaters need to explain their arguments well and clearly state why I should vote for your team. 
 
I also request that roadmaps be given at the beginning of each round. This means I would like you to clearly state how I should flow and organize the debate round on my flow template. I find that I understand the debate more when the debaters are organized. This requires me to be organized in the round and follow your arguments. It is also important that you clue me in on when you want your prep time to start and stop. Overall, I also look for debaters to have fun. This is an educational activity. With that being said, there should be a balance of good sportsmanship along with thoughtful arguments.
