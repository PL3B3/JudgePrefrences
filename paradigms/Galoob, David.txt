  I have been involved in coaching Lincoln Douglass debate since 2000 when I was the assistant coach at suburban Norman North High School. Since then, I have gone on to become the head coach at Cascia Hall in Tulsa, OK. I also am on the Sr. Staff of both the beginning and Advanced divisions of Lincoln Douglass Debate at the Cameron University debate camp in Lawton, OK.
I enjoy many different styles of argumentation, but critical arguments are still new to me and require much explanation. I expect the debaters I judge to signpost well and have an understandable rate. I am willing to cross apply arguments made in previous speeches to “dropped” arguments, and prefer debate to be persuasive rather than game-like. Evidence, persuasive speech, and fair play all make up this approach.
