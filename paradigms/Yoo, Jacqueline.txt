  I graduated from Coronado High School in Nevada. I have done Speech and Debate for 4 years. I did LD for 3, and Policy for 1.

1. I'm okay with speed, but if you're going to then please go at an understandable speed.

2. Onto the topic of topicality, I don't generally like the topicality argument, but if you're opponents aren't being topical then call them out on it and provide the evidence to back it up.

3. I focus on framework.

4. I normally vote on how many arguments each team wins, but if you decide to focus on only a few arguments those will most likely be voters to me.

5. I also vote on impact, so show me the impact calc.

6. I like Ks, but don't spend an excessive amount of time on that.

7. I love counterplans and think that they can be fun when executed correctly.

8. That's about it. Just be polite too, but also stand your ground. Don't be obnoxious. And tell me why you're winning the debate.
