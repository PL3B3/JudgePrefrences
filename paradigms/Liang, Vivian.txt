  As a 4 year veteran LD debater and first-year-out-of-high-school debate judge, I only have a few, basic paradigms that should not be a surprise to anyone:

1. Give me offense with strong warrants, links, and impacts.

2. Weighing analysis is incredibly important. Outweigh your opponent on magnitude, probability, anything. If the round comes down to an absolute wash, the winner will seriously be determined by coin toss.

3. Do not try to extend through ink or go new in the rebuttals.

4. Sign post and road map, please.

5. Taking risks is encouraged. Foolishness is discouraged. Barring any extreme case of abuse, I'm open to non-traditional arguments, and I will evaluate them just like any other argument.

6. Speed is fine up to a certain extent. If at any time I feel your pace and/or your speaking style is prohibiting me from understanding you, I will give a verbal cue, i.e., "slower," "clearer," etc. If conditions don't improve after that, speaker points are ruthlessly docked.

Any specific concerns can be addressed before a round. Most importantly, have fun, learn something, regret nothing. Good luck!
