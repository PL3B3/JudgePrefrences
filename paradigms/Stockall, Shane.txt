  I was an International Extemporaneous speaker in high school, and I've been studying Computer Science since 2013. 

Since I was in Extemp, I'm able to flow (and will). I'm able to look past my own beliefs to up vote the better argument. I also care more about the depth of an argument much more than the breadth of one (Just because you have a bunch of evidence does not guarantee a win). Warrant and impact (but especially good impact) extensions will win rounds for me. That said, since I come from the speech side of things, a well presented argument will win when I believe the arguments to be equal. 

I'm not a fan of long debates about whose card is better, so if there is some discrepancy, please resolve it quickly. On the subject of evidence, relevance is key. Poorly related evidence will only hurt your case.
