  I am currently a student at the University of Chicago. I have never done debate competitively, although I am somewhat familiar with the activity. Because I haven't done this activity competitively, be sure to talk at a pace that most people can understand. I am familiar with some contemporary philosophy, and even more familiar with modern philosophy; however, I may not be familiar with the specifics of your argument. Because I have never actively participated in the activity, I am not able to keep as detailed a flow as former debaters, though I try to make my decisions as objectively and most based on the arguments as possible. The type of arguments that I tend to like are real world and reasonable - try to avoid running things that are not common sense. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask me before the round
