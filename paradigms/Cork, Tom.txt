  Overall Paradigm:

Tabula Rasa judge: 
If the presented Plan is in a Stock Issues format, then I will vote as a stock-issues judge once Kritiks and Topicality are won. If a Comparative Advantage Plan is run, then I will shift to a policymaker framework and weigh Advantages against DAs (see the note on DAs below), once Kritiks and Topicality are won.If a Kritikal Aff is run, then all bets are off. Run framework and tell me why I should be voting for you.
Kritiks are a priori to Topicality, which in turn is a priori to the Plan.

Speed:

I enjoy spreading, but I dislike fast mumbling. If you’re not a proficient spreader, slow down. Reducing speed for tags, cites, and underviews helps your case immensely.

Theory:

Theory won’t win a debate on its own. Claiming in-round abuse or that your argument is better for education requires justification and strong links.

Kritiks:

I love Kritiks, but they must be strongly linked to the Plan. Otherwise, Kritiks are non-unique DAs.

Tell me the story of the Kritik. I want to hear persuasion and thought behind these arguments. A well-done K will make my weekend.

K Affs: Bring it on. Performance K Affs: Bring it on. Just tell the story well.

Politics DAs:

Please, no politics DAs unless you can prove that the loss of political capital extends past enactment of the plan.

Things that make my heart go pitter-pat:
Confident, assured underviewsFocusing on the claims above the evidenceTeams that stay on the offense and show clear strategyTOPICALITY (as long as it is a well-structured T debate that is strongly linked to the Plan)
Things that make me cringe in my seat:
Evidence battlesAny kind of murky ethics (mis-claiming dropped contentions, falsely stating rules, overusing flash time for prep, etc.)Having to vote on a weakly supported, but crucial, argument that wasn't answered.
