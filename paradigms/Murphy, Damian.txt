  Background
Conflicts- Strake Jesuit.

High school:

Competed in Pofo 2 years

Qualified for state junior year, senior year was weird (that's my super political excuse).

Post-High school:
Barely thought about debate since I graduated


Paradigm-

I'm a public forum coach who understands LD but coaches public forum because we have debate topics for a reason. As bad as this sounds I 
don't really have a paradigm for LD if you win the round you win the round. I'm not going to be mad because it doesn't fit some weird conception
 of debate that everyone may not share. . I can follow spread.
