What paradigm best describes your approach to debate?_xPolicy Maker _xStock Issues _Tabula Rasa_Games Player _Hypothesis Tester _Other (Explain)

What do you think the Aff burdens should be?
The affirmative needs to prove that they have a good solid workable case that is supportive by a preponderance of the evidence. They need to present a workable plan that is cohesive with the case that they are promulgating.

What do you think the Neg burdens should be? The negative has the burden of refutation. At some point they need directly to clash with some of points made by the affirmative. They should not try to warp the round until the negative sets the grounds and topic for the debate. There should be some semblance of the initial topic choice of the affirmative


How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)?
Medium. I do not like double clutching…..I do not like the impression it gives that someone could pass out soon. I do believe that there still needs to be a modicum of speaking skills exhibited in what started as a speaking event.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks?

I am ok with generic disads. I do not like negatives that run counter plans and kritiks that are sponges to soak up time and then they kick out of them. If the negative elects for a specific strategy then they should not kick out of it.

How I feel about case debates?
Ok.

Other Comments/Suggestions: 
I do tend to be old fashioned and I am aware of that. I like a good logical debate with points made in round. I have nothing against a negative strategy but it needs to be well articulated. If the negative opts for an elaborate counterploy then they need to defend it and stick with it. I will listen to games playing and vote on it. I may not particularly like it.
