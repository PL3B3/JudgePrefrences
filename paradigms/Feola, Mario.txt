Do what you do best. I’m comfortable with must arguments. Put yourself in my shoes and ask yourself how to make it easiest for me to vote for you. As long as you’re doing good analysis and what you’re saying makes sense, I’m likely to vote for you.

I fall squarely in the Mahoney school of clarity – if I have to yell “clear” more than once, your speaker points will suffer.

I will try my best to be objective, although I will reward your ethos within the round
CX is very important, as is your general demeanor and presentationReference cross-x in your speechesDon’t be afraid to make bold decisions or use humor – it’ll improve the round
 Don’t steal prep – stop typing when the timer goes off. 

Don’t read arguments you don’t understand.

Answer the best version of your opponent’s argument. 

Impacts on theory/T are your friend. 

Don’t say “tix”

I am not easily offended – take from that what you will.
