  Policy Debate: 
I am not a fan of kritiks or generic DA's. I feel that they take away from the discussion on the policy the Aff team has provided. I like case specific arguments and very unique DA's. I am also not a big fan of unrealistic impacts. I do not like T when it is used as a time suck. I would like to see the Neg attack workability of the Aff's plan and also argue solvency. I will vote for the team that provides me with the best world to live in. If I believe the world would be better with the Aff's plan, I will vote for them. Otherwise, I will vote for the Neg.

LD:
Simply put, it is all about the value. Uphold yours and defeat your opponents.

PF:
I will vote for the side that gives me the most quality arguments. Drops are not that big of a concern unless they are key arguments. Simply put, I will vote for the more persuasive team.
