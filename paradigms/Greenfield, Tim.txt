  I debated for 4 years at Apple Valley HS in MN from 2004-2007. I'm now the head coach of Edina in MN. I mostly coach PF and Extemp, but my competitive experiences were in LD. Circuit LD is different now, but I'm in the debate community enough now to feel comfortable to adapt to your preferences.

1. Be respectful of your opponent, and any in-round aggression will be noted in my decision against you. Discourse Ks and theory arguments are fine to run.

2. I'm not super well-versed in the intricacies of 'circuit' LD, but I understand K and Policy arguments much better than super dense philosophical positions. Go ahead and run the K and 2 off, but probably best to skip past the D+G. Theory--more explanatory weight dedicated in the 1A/1NC/1AR itself, the more likely I am to entertain voting on it later in the round.

3. My flowing is adequate, but again, have been coaching for 3 years in PF, so I'll probably need a bit to adjust if you go super-fast.

4. I evaluate arguments based on how the debaters tell me to evaluate them. The role of the ballot discussion has to be substantive if there are alternative justifications to voting on topical arguments. Explanations in the 2nd rebuttals need to be clear and less tech, but that's just a stylistic preference.


5. My speaker point scale starts at 28. Anything below is a poor execution of either strategy or indicative of misguided behavior (will be specific on the ballot, and happy to answer questions after the fact). Anything above is largely predicated on your speaking skills, debating technique, and inclusive and respectful discourse if running or answering alternative positions.

6. Any questions, just ask!
