  I consider myself to be tabula rasa, I will listen to anything but tell me what paradigm you want me to view the debate, or I will be forced to pick one for the round. I prefer no speed, but as long as you are clear I will be flowing. I prefer quality over quantity of arguments, this makes for a better debate and good warranted arguments should follow from this. A good comparison of arguments and in most cases of evidence is a must along with a good impact calculus, if applicable. Direct clash is absolutely the most important thing in the round, if this is not happening it will be very hard for me to make a decision. Performances are interesting but require a lot of work in terms of framing, a good explanation of what my ballot means/does is needed.
