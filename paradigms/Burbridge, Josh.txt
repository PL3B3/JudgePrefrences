  I'll keep it concise.

LD:
-I almost always vote on the Value Criterion first. If you win the criterion, you have a huge advantage. The value itself doesn't matter all that much.
-Categorical Burdens (i.e. "I only have to prove one specific case, but my opponent must disprove all cases") are unfair. I won't penalize you if you try to place it, but I won't buy it.
-It's always best to have analytics AND evidence, but I won't necessarily penalize you for lacking either.
-Speed is fine, as long as you're articulate. 
-For god's sake, please signpost as clearly as possible.
-I'll flow anything as long as it's fair. K's and theory are both fine, if I can understand what you're talking about. If you think I'm going to have trouble understanding it, I probably will.

POLICY:
-See above, except for the bit about values.
-In general, Neg should either support the SQ or provide an alternative. I don't like to vote for nihilism.
-A PIC is fine, too.

In general, though, I don't feel like you should be pandering to my debate preferences. It should be up to the debaters to create the proper framework within a round, and win through it. Like I said, I'll flow anything. The context of each round is unique, so a specific argument may win you one round, but be completely irrelevant in the other. That's why the criterion is so important in LD.
