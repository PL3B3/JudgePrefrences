  I'm not extremely experienced in debate. This will only be my second debate that I've judged. I am a graduate from Utah state with a major in economics with a minor in accounting, as well as an MBA from Westminster. I judge based on logical presentation of facts, as well I appreciate it when a road map is presented and followed, and the confidence of the presentation given.
