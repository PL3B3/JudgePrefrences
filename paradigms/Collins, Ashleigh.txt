  Background: I debated for Grapevine High School (Texas) from 1998 to 2001.

Speed: Since I debated in Texas, I am not bothered by speed. With that said, if you choose to pick up the speed, you still need to be clear and comprehensible.
Preferences: The following matters to me: establishing your value/criterion, explaining how your arguments link to that value/criterion, signposting (going line-by-line is ideal unless your explain how and why you're grouping arguments), identifying your voters, and weighing the round. I am not bothered by counterplans IF they: (1) are topical, and (2) do not become an excuse for overlooking your opponent's argumentation and weighing between the two sides. Also, I will not make connections for you. So be sure to include a claim, warrant, and impact for each argument you want me voting on.
Pet peeves: Rudeness, unnecessarily loud volume, and poor posture while presenting

Read Jane Boyd's LD philosophy--it describes my outlook pretty accurately
