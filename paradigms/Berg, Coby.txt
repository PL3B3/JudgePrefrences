I'm currently a parli and LD debater in college

I come from the Kansas City area and I would say my judges were fairly lay. I like in depth arguments.

I will vote for standard stock issue rounds I would most likely vote for the team with the largest practical impacts. 

Aff Team: I only want you to tell me in depth what your plan does and why it's good. 

Neg Team: I will follow any arguments you put down but if the are silly I will most likely ignore them unless the AFF just completely drops them. I'm not a fan of Ks or Theory.
I will vote for T though. Any other arguments you run I will flow.

Both teams explain the warrants of your arguments and why I should care. 

I am not a fan of speed I can handle it, but I think of it as a cheap trick to try to get you opponent to drop an argument I want to judge clash not dropped arguments. So a very conversational approach will get you bonus points with me.

Have Fun
