  So...

I don't really have any specific philosophy. I'll vote on anything you impact and tell me I should vote on without just asserting "VOTE ON THIS BEFORE YOU DIE." That's not enough. Impact you arguments, theory and topicality as well. You can spread and tag team. With tag teaming though, if one person is clearly dominating a cross ex that's not theirs, it's going to look bad. 

That's about it... obviously I'll answer any questions you may have before the round starts.
