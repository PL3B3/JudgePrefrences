  I am a coach at Lakeville High School so I am knowledgeable about the topic and how debate works. I also competed in debate 3 years ago so I am not that far removed from actual competition. I have also been judging for the past three years at both local tournaments and national tournaments that Lakeville has gone to. I hate intervening and will do all that I can to avoid it. That said, you need to give me standards in order to weigh the round. I believe evidence is an important part of debate and would like to see it in cases and rebuttals, but used properly, which means warranting and impacting. I also believe the standards debate is important to the round, and feel that too many debaters gloss over this in their rebuttals.I am fine with theories, Ks, and all of that stuff, just do it with a purpose in mind; don't do a K just to do a K, explain why you are doing something, how it works, and why it matters. Speed wise I am fine, I am pretty sure I can handle whatever speed you go at. I do not believe you need speed to be a great debater, or to win my ballot. Just make sure you explain yourself throughout the debate and tell me why I should vote for you. I am a pretty simple judge, and if you have any questions you can ask me.
