  I am from the south and prefer civility and manners. I must be able to understand you to vote for you. I am against spreading as it is not necessarily how we talk in real life. Plus if I cannot understand you, I cannot flow and if I cannot flow, I cannot vote for your side. 
I prefer for you to prove your point with evidence. I cannot follow your line of reasoning that voting AFF will lead to excessive alcohol use and therefore spousal abuse unless you have some sort of facts/evidence to back up your claim. Otherwise I will drop it. 
I am not real fond of rabbit holes. Stick to the topic. You should be able to win your case without having to change the topic 
I have a great app on my phone that will keep up with time. Do not attempt to undermine my authority in the debate. When all is said and done, the ballot vote belongs to me.
