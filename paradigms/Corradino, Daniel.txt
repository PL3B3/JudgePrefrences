  I do not have alot of preferences. Please be clear and understandable when you are speaking, unclear spreading will not be evaluated. I am open to any form of argument, as long as it is explained clearly in the round. If you choose to pursue an unusual strategy to win the round please clearly state why I should vote for you because of it.
