1. Im a very Traditional Judge. I enjoy value and criterion clash. I am not very knowledgeable on the complicated philosophy, so if you want to use that kind of framework then you need to explain it very well.
2. I do not like or flow spreading. If you want to spread don't pref me. 
3. I would much rather a traditional debate than a policy debate. I do not understand the newer policy arguments, so if you read them you need to know that there much higher threshold for me to buy these arguments.
4. Any argument you make should be linked back to your framework, and please warrant your normative claims. With anything, tell me why you're right. The more work I have to do for you on the flow, the harder it will be to win.

Speaks will be determined by the competition of each tournament. But being a persuasive speaker and nice in round is a good way to get high speaks from me.

If you have any more questions feel free to ask me before the round.
