Top line: You don't have to change your arguments for me. Run what you think you will do the best with. I loved debating and I wouldn't want anybody to have to not run something they're passionate about because a judge didn't want to listen to them. I will try to be as understanding and fair as I can. With that being said I might not know all the intricacies of your specific CP theory or your niche critical literature so don't assume anything. However, I will try as hard as I can to understand as long as you try to help me along the way :)

Critical Affs: I mostly ran critical affs in high school so I'm cool with these. I would say that the only thing that would annoy me with this (and this is true for the 1 off K teams as well) is if you do a super long overview at the top and it ruins the flow. It gets to the point sometimes where it feels like you're lecturing the other team more than you are actually debating them. 

FW/T: I took FW/T a lot in the 1nr during my senior year so its not that I'm unsympathetic to this argument at all. I think these debates go a lot better when you do more impact work than just saying "and thats a voter for fairness". Tell more more about how it affects the way people would have to approach debate under the other teams model. 

Please feel free to run any assortment of policy related arguments, I loved a lot of the straight up policy v policy debates I had in high school. 

I'm probably forgetting something so please feel free to ask if you have any questions for me!
