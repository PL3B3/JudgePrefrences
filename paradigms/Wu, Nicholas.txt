  Summary:
Former Public Forum debaterTalking fast = fine; spreading with good signposting/numbering = okay; spreading with no signposting = noTry to avoid KsPrefer substantive debate over theoryGive voters & Impact calcAsk me any specific questions before the round starts
Debate Experience:
Three years in Public Forum5th at NationalsState semisTwo years in slow PolicyPublic Forum was my main focus, therefore I know SOME jargon, but not all of it.
Speed:
Talking quickly is fineSpreading while signposting and numbering well is okaySpreading without signposting or numbering will make me unable to flow half the stuff where you want me toIf you're spreading too quickly, then I will say "Clear" or "Slow" as many as times as necessary.If you're making analytics, then you should probably slow down; spreading through cards at lightning speed is fine.
Kritik:
Probably won't vote for you straight off of one, as I don't really care for them at allPlease provide an alternative or else I'll have no idea what happens when I vote for the K
Theory:
If someone runs an abusive case or does something abusive and is NOT called out on it, then major props and I'll turn a blind eye.If you run theory and it is valid, then I'll like you a lot more, but it won't necessarily win you the roundImpact theory with out-round implications or explain why I should look to theory before substance.
Voting Issues:
First I look at the framework/weighing mechanism.Second is each side's voters.Finally I weigh appropriately.If any of the aforementioned are missing, then I will have to intervene and when I intervene, I will not be weighing/voting the way you want me to
