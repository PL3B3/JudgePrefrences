  Richard J. Lichtenstein, MD
Lay Judge
Pine View School, Osprey, FL

Background: NFL in High School (when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth)
Judging in both PFD and LD for approximately 1 year

Debate Philosophy
Preferences: Aff on Left, Neg on Right
Will provide hand signals upon request
Prefer conversational style. If I can't follow you, I can't judge you
I prefer clarity over speed.
I am attentive, but if you see me put my pen down and cross my arms, you have lost me and need to recover my interest and 
ability to follow you
Provide me with a coherent roadmap, laying out your values and contentions and warrants clearly
I do not mind if you read your opening remarks, but read with gusto, poise and style. You have been practicing this, I don't expect it to
sound like the first time you've seen it. If you can't pronounce it correctly, that is a problem for me
I will not tolerate rudeness, vulgarity or overt attacks on your opponent as an individual
I will not provide a verbal critique at the end of the round
I attempt to judge coming into the round as a "tabula rasa" and will only base my decisions on what is actually said in the round. However,
I have a degree in History, and an MD. If you cite or quote historical or medical literature, ensure you know what you are talking about,
be prepared to be asked to demonstrate or show citations to me, and pronounce everything perfectly
