  I am a parent judge who began judging LD in the 2013-14 school year, with many rounds of experience. 

I tend toward the traditional LD approach, with the value and value criterion argument setting the stage for the debate. Contentions should support the V and VC and should include research. While I do not mind the use of "voters," please be respectful of your judge's ability to decide the debate.

While I understand the need to speak quickly, I advise you to follow a pace at which I can easily track your arguments. If I don't know what you are saying because you speak too quickly, I will be inclined toward your slower-paced opponent.
