  First of all, I’m a lay, parent judge with 2-year experience in LD and PF.
 I’ve judged LD (most novice and JV rounds) at a couple of bid and local tournaments, so I’m familiar with a lot of jargon, but definitely don’t assume that I know everything.
 Theory, kritiks, disads, and counterplans must be explained. I prefer substance. Don’t spread because I won’t be able to flow you.
