  I debated policy competitively in high school (Reno High School, NV), but I haven’t judged in a while--and I haven't judged on this topic. In addition, I really enjoy slower debates. You can run whatever you feel like, but I would much rather see 3 or 4 arguments deeply developed throughout the round than a lot of spreading and minimal clash. I want to be sure to catch everything on the flow, and after a little while out of the game I think I should ease back into it. 

I’m fine with any arguments you want to run. I prefer specific links and current events arguments; I’m (generally) a fan of unique counterplans with relevant net benefits, and I like topicality if argued well. Case debate is strongly encouraged. Generic DAs/politics, other theory, kritiks-- anything else is good if you feel comfortable debating it, and you try and explain it well and show how it interacts with other arguments in the round. I believe that debaters who are honest about who is winning what and why it matters are more effective than those who claim to be winning everything. 

The only requests I have are politeness and civility. Everyone is here to learn and have fun, so do your best to have a good time! Debaters who don’t take themselves too seriously, understand what they are talking about, and understand the round as a whole entity—rather than a speech by speech event—do well and it’s easy to tell. I will happily answer questions before the round, too to clarify/qualify anything I've written here and if you have questions about certain arguments or methods. Have fun!
