  Judging Philosophy- Michael Courtney

I'm a sophomore member of the Western Kentucky Forensic Team. I'm mainly a IE competitor, but I really enjoy debate and have experience judging it on the high school level. Here are my thoughts:

1. Warrantless debates are mind numbing. If you do not have a warrant to a claim, then you do not have an argument even if they drop it.
2. I don't really care about speed--go as fast as you want as long as you are clear and warranted. If you are speaking too quickly, I'll let you know. Speak at whatever pace you're most comfortable with, just be CLEAR.
3. You should probably use your criterion or don't have one.
4. Tell me which arguments are important and why. Tell me why I should ignore other arguments. 
5. I often vote for the one argument I can find that actually has an impact.
6. Run whatever strategy you want--I will do my best to evaluate whatever you give me. But please give me the tools to do so...
7. If you are rude, I will not hesitate to tank your speaker points.
8. I don't like intervening so I won't do it unless I'm forced to...

Debate, have fun, and be engaging!
