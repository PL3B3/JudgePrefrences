  I debated throughout high school at Westminster. I don't debate in college but I am still involved through judging. I was a 2A all through high school.

Some things to remember-
Don't don't don't clip cards. I will drop you automatically if you do. You can be confident/in control of the round without being rude. I am fine with speed but make sure you are clear.

Speaker Points-
I consider CX to be a speech so speaker points will be a combination of your performance in your speeches and CX. I base speaker points off of how much control you have over the debate, clarity, articulation, and your attitude towards the round/other team. As I said before, you can be confident without being rude.

I am open to most arguments as long as you are articulate and explain to me why I should vote for you. I'm not a big fan of performance based arguments so running them in front of me is probably not the best idea.
Impacting and clearly explaining arguments is important to me. Make sure you explain to me why I should be voting for something. Don't just extend your evidence, explain what it means and why it is important in the context of the round and why I should evaluate it.
I am fine with most arguments. If you run a K make sure you spend a lot of time making the K specific to the debate. I find it hard to vote for the generic K if it has no relevance to what's actually going on in the round. I'm not a fan of consult CP's and you will probably have a hard time convincing me to vote for it.
