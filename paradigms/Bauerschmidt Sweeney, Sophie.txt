Debated at BCC 2011-13

Most of my debate experience has been kritikal, but I obviously evaluate each round as objectively as possible, based on the arguments made in the round. I don't have a default way that I think you should relate to the resolution, so that, like pretty much everything else in debate, is something to be resolved in-round. 

Ks: I was pretty much 1-off for all of high school, so in the broadest sense I like the K. That said, I don't like stupid arguments like time cube. If you win a debate on that sort of thing, I'll vote for you, but I wont like it. 

Disads and CPs: I haven't run these much, but I know how they work, I like to think I'm not stupid, and I know how to flow, so don't think that you can only go for the K in front of me. 

K aff vs. FW/T: I'm sure I have some internal biases in favor of the aff in these debates, but like I said, I'll do my best to not let those biases play any role in my decision. That said, it may affect my threshold for specific arguments (I'm less inclined, for example to view the lack of a link to politics as a reason why the neg can't say anything against the aff).
