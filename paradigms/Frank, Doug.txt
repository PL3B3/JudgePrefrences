I have been coaching for 22 years, attending between 15 - 20 speech & debate meets per year. I've coached both NCFL and/or NFL nationals qualifiers in LD & PF every year since 1997. This is the 2nd year Lincoln East has had a team at TOC.

I am primarily an LD & PF judge. Please, never ever schedule me to judge a policy round. I will scream and run away. For the events that I do judge, consider me to be an old school judge. I can flow speed, but I don't like to. I'm not a big fan of Policy stylings creeping into LD, so please keep that in mind. I like a traditional standards-contention approach. If you make a claim-best have a warrant to support it or I probably won't buy it. On the political spectrum, I'm a big left-winger.

For PF, same thing in that I give much more weight to warrants that have proper support. Don't throw numbers that can be easily manipulated at me-I'm not a big numbers fan. Also, please make sure you stick to issues brought up in constructive speeches. New stuff in later speeches isn't cool.

Please maintain civility. Nothing is a bigger turn-off than a pissy debater!
