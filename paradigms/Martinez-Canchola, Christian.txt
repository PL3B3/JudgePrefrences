  Hey there,

I'm a graduate of Kenyon College in Gambier, OH. Now I'm back in Dallas, TX as a Teach For America corps member teaching bi-lingual elementary school. I use to debate LD at the Law Magnet High School in Dallas, Texas where I graduated in 2008.

Let me know if you have any questions in the round.

Best,
Christian
