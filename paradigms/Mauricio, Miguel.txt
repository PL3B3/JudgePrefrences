  I am 21 and have been debating Parli in college for the past two years. I have no other experience with debate besides policy because I have seen a lot of policy rounds. 

In terms of debate, I will hear anything as long as you link it out correctly. For example, don't just tell me that nuclear war is going to happen, explain to me how it is going to happen. I will not do any work for you, so if you do not thoroughly flush out your arguments it will make it harder for me to judge its validity and strength. In addition, you tell me where I should be voting and what is most important in the round, I should not have to interfere here. I am fine with procedurals as long as they are flushed out correctly. If you collapse out of a procedural and the other team calls you abusive for it and runs with it, I will vote on abuse. 

Speed is fine, but I am not a huge fan of it. As long as I can understand what youre saying and I am not hearing just a bunch of gasps for air you should be fine. I believe that debate is a team sport, so partner prompting is fine as long as it is not excessive, but I will only flow whatever comes out of the mouth of the main speaker. 

Overall, I love hearing good arguments and whoever wins impact analysis will have my vote at the end of the round.
