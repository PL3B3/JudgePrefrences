  I have 5 years of college Parli experience. I am okay on the flow but I'm not a speed debater so keep that in mind if you plan to spread. I view debate simply as a game, which means you can run whatever you want. Just please, for the sake of everyone, warrant out your arguments. On procedural arguments, I generally default to an abuse paradigm, but I will gladly listen to competing interpretations if you specify for me to do so. As for procedural arguments that do operate under an abuse paradigm, I require a specific and articulated abuse scenario otherwise I probably won't vote for it. I like the K, but view reject only or non-active alternatives as problematic to the inherent structure of K. Most importantly have fun and be nice to your fellow competitors. Debate is not only a competition, but an educational activity.
