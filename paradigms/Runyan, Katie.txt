  I debated for four years in high school for Starr's Mill, the last three of which were LD.

SPEED: I don't want to be bored, on the other hand, I want to have a decent flow of the round. So on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say 7 or 8 is a good speed.

TOPICALITY: I don't like people running T for the sake of running T. If there is legitimate abuse in the round, by all means, RUN T. If not, I'd rather not hear it. Regardless, if you can win on it, there's a good chance I'll vote for it and I'm willing to see it as a priori as long as it's backed by appropriate warrents.

KRITIKS: I like them and I'll buy them provided I can understand them. I'm not interested in your ability to confuse your opponent (and perhaps myself). I'd rather just see good arguments, kritiks or otherwise.

CP's: If there's not a plan, you're going to have to spend a significant amount of time convincing me that there is a warrant for a counterplan. Otherwise, go for it.

THEORY(including most a prioris): If you run it, I'll buy it until its rebutted. When things get unclear, I'll default to the side who makes the most sense and who seems to have fairness on their side (any additional offcase I feel the same way about)

THIS YEAR: I haven't judged any debates this year. I've thrown around ideads with local highschool on various topics, but besides that, haven't been really involved in debate since last year.

I like a clean flow. If i can't follow the speech, there's no guarentee that things will get flowed. Underviews are always good, specifically when you're weighing the round for me (which can never be done too early). I hate when people are rude, and although it won't cause me to drop you on the spot, it certainly won't help. I also like discussion ON the topic. Getting caught up in smaller debates won't help anyone. Oh -- and I lllove warrents and impacts!
