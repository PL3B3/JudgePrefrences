  I am a novice judge who is more likely to be swayed by logic and presentation than technicalities and rhetoric. Give me definitions because I will set up my framework of the resolution around the definitions you present. If your opponentâ€™s definitions are narrowly slanted to their case, please call them on it and provide counter definitions with compelling reasons to prefer your interpretation of the resolution.

Speed: Spread at your own peril. If I cannot understand what you are saying, I cannot understand what you are saying.
Value: Explain the value and how it supports what you are advocating
Criterion: I will look for this to validate the value.
CX time: I like you to face judge standing.
Kritik & Theory: These more progressive arguments will need to be thoroughly explained.

I will look for well-supported contentions in your own words rather than just a bunch of note cards. I like to see how you apply your research and I like to see how quick you can react to your opponent in a round.

Be professional, but that does not mean you cannot have fun and have to be a robot.
