  Debate/Judging Background:
I debated LD for South Grand Prairie high School in Dallas County, Texas. I graduated in 2005. I did not debate in college, but I started judging debate tournaments after graduation, and so very regularly for several years. I have done a lot of work with the NFL and TFL.

I have experience judging LD, CX or Policy, Congress.

Debate Philosophy:
I do not mind speed and can flow it, but I would prefer if the speaker slowed down.

To not make things complicated, I want the debaters to articulate clearly and to give voters. Most importantly I will be looking for their case to have a contention with a claim, one or more warrant(s) and an impact that supports the value criterion, to make the rounds easy to judge.
