  I debated LD for 3 years in high school and have judged in college at Swarthmore. 

I’m fine with speed and will vote on pretty much whatever as long as it’s well warranted/justified. However, I don’t like theory and won’t vote on it unless your opponent is being abusive. 

Standards are important so extend/justify them and link your arguments back to some sort of framework. Weighing of arguments in the round is important.
