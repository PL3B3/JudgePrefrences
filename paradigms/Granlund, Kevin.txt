  Debated for four years at Apple Valley High School graduating in 2009. 

I'm cool with pretty much anything you want to do as long as you weigh the arguments, and give a mechanism for weighing them. If you want me to vote for you it needs to be made pretty explicitly clear why I should be voting for you. 

the only arguments I really dislike are ones that aren't explained or thought out, so don't give me one sentence blips and expect me to vote on them, if an argument isn't explained at all I'm likely to either ignore it or accept minimal answers to it. Other than that, I don't have a preferred way that I like to see arguments being made. 

Speaker points are almost completely based on the ability to engage your opponent, and cover the flow/keep it moderately clean.

On a side note, I haven't been involved in debate for 5 years in any meaningful way, as such I'm not going to be able to keep up with very high speed. Even if you're exceedingly clear, I probably won't be able to follow you if you're going to be speaking extremely rapidly. I can probably still handle some amount of speed, but not anything near top speeds. This is especially true if you're running anything that is complicated/hard to follow. I'm fine with anything you want to run, but if you're going to blitz dense Ks at me I'm not going to be able to follow it.


Any other questions just ask before the round.
