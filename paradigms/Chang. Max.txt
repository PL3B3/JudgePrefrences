  Debated for four years at Whippany Park High School in New Jersey from 2005-2009 and spent time on both the national (northeast) and local circuits. Judged in 2010-2012 at Stanford, Cal, and New Jersey districts.

Speed: I haven't judged in a few years so please be reasonable with your speed. I will signal if I want you to slow down. Do not go fast just for the sake of going fast. If you are going fast, youâ€™d better be making new arguments and not just repeating or rewording previous arguments. Please slow down and enunciate card names and tag lines.

Theory: I used to have a very high threshold for theory, but after judging a few tournaments on the west coast, I realized that it is extremely prevalent and I might as well get used to it. That being said, I'd still prefer to hear a substantive topical round.
