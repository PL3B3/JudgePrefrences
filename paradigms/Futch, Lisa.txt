  This is my third year of high school judging. I judged two years of middle school debate and helped coach the middle school team that went to nationals that year. My favorite debate is LD. I expect it to be a value debate with clash from aff and neg. I do not like definition debates! Stick to the issues. I have judged 9 rounds of debates on this issue, double flighted. I like debaters to have clear communication with clear points, good evidence and examples, and courtesy during rounds. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't seem to me like they focus on the main question being asked in the resolution. I will be judging LDJV at this tournament, but I expect that the debates will be just as prepared and contentious.
