  I did not compete in LD but I know the event and I have judged it on occasion.

Framework: Please explain to me how the round should be judged. If your opponent brings up a framework and you don't respond to it, I'll likely judge the round based on their framework.

Speed: I prefer slower speakers. I cannot flow if you spread, so please don't. If I don't hear it because you were talking too fast, you didn't say it.

Philosophical arguments: I like these a lot. If you can explain why a specific philosophy ties in to the resolution in a way that strengthens your value, it will help you a lot in the round.

Debate is about convincing your judge (me) that your side is stronger. Do that and I'll pick you up.
