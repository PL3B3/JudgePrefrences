  I am non-interventionist. It is up to the debaters to persuade me that they/he/she have won the round. That being said, do not assume that I understand jargon, acronyms or shorthand as substitutes for fully developed arguments. I have no ideology as to speed, but I will make no apologies if I fail to understand speeches. In L-D I vote as guided by the ballot and/or league rules. As a default, LD is a value based debate and I will vote accordingly. In CX, there is more room for the debaters to define the round. In PFD, because there is no burden of proof, I will vote in whichever direction I was more persuaded from the outset of the round.
