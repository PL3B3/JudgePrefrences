  I am a parent judge, for fort lauderdale high, who is judging LD for the first time. be clear about how arguments function in the round and explain how the ballot works, what i should be voting off of, and weigh arguments against your opponents. I am not familiar with any jargon of debate, and will try to be expressive if I don't understand what you are saying.
