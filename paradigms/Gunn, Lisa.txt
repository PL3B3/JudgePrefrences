  I'm a traditional judge. That means I'm highly unlikely to vote strictly on the flow. Just because the Aff dropped the #2 on the standard doesn't mean I give it any more credence than a better explained and more persuasive argument. I'm also not super experienced with the activity (I never debated in high school or college) so if you ask me hyper-specific questions about my RFD after the round I might not have a definite answer.

No speed, tricks, or lots of jargon (I'm still getting used to terms like "PIC" or "kritik"). You can run whatever you want in front of me, but the more complex the position the more nuanced your explanation needs to be
