  I debated for four years in high school at Heritage Hall in Oklahoma City. I went to the TOC my senior year. I debated last year for the University of Texas at Austin. While I read mainly policy strategies in high school and college, I am also familiar with more "main stream" Ks. One note in terms of critiques - I don't find buzz words compelling. Consult CPs and politics were my go to arguments. I have only judged a few times since I've been in college, and not at all this year.
