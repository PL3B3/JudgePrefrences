  This is for the Harvard Tournament

I debated throughout my four years at Loyola High School and qualified to the TOC my senior year. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT JUDGED ALL YEAR. IT WILL TAKE ME A ROUND OR TWO TO GET BACK IN THE GROOVE.

This will be more extensive later today. Just know that I am not a fan of high theory; I like K and theory debates; and I am willing to vote on anything so long as it is not blatantly offensive. I am generous with my speaker points, but I will not give out 30's unless they are well-deserved. (See Chris Kymn's paradigm about 30's.) 

I will be there before the round to answer questions.
