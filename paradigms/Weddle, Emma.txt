  Debated LD 4 years at Des Moines Roosevelt, graduated 2015, qualified to TOC twice & NDCA nationals once
Speed is fine, but slow debate is just as good.
I haven't judged in a year, so please keep in mind that I may need a couple seconds to adjust should you decide to speak quickly
Non-traditional/critical arguments can be interesting provided that debater knows what they're saying
Frivolous theory (most theory) brings the integrity of the debate down. Please don't, or at least keep it to a minimum. If an argument is truly abusive, then you most likely will not need to spend half your speech explaining how it can be perceived as such. Tell me why the argument shouldn't be allowed and move on. Better yet, just tell me why the argument is false.
Tell me how you want me to evaluate the round. Or don't, and I'll try my best to evaluate whatever you throw my way, but you may not be happy if you choose to do that.
Have fun and try to be pleasant to one another
