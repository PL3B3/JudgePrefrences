  BACKGROUND:

BA in Communications and a MA in English. Coach for Coronado High School. Prefer Lincoln Douglas and Public Forum over Policy and Congress.


GENERAL OVERVIEW:
I only judge PF and do not understand your jargon. K's confuse me, so if for some reason you decide to run one, make it understandable to a non-debate person. T is a good argument if you prove in round abuse. I want a clear organized debate with a lot of impact calculus. It is your job to impact your debate, not mine. Go heavy on the line by line. In the end debate is about education and communication, so have fun and keep it a clean debate.
