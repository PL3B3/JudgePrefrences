Philosophy:
  
 I expect you to set up the framework by which I should be judging the round. If you fail to do this, even if you think your value argument was wildly compelling, I may decide it subsumes to something else. If you think your value argument is tantamount, tell me that. I like to hear voters.

 The framework of the debate should not be about how unfair your side of the debate is. I am not a fan of abuse. You chose to enter into debate, you should know the rules. Focus on the observation. 
 
 I prefer that LD debate not be conducted at lightning speed. I don't like any forms of debate conducted that way. Debate is supposed to be about clarity in articulating your arguments, and if I can't understand you, you aren't doing that. Please understand that if you spread/spew I am very likely to turn the debate from a flow debate to a lay debate decision. 

Having a lot of evidence is admirable, but it's not nearly as important as having compelling evidence with clear analysis. You don't win by picking and arranging cards. You win by explaining how these pieces of evidence create a compelling rationale. 

Please extend your arguments, if you don't they will drop off my flow. 

If you plan to run off-case or performative arguments, it is your burden to explain how they link to the debate that is supposed to be taking place, i.e., a debate on the resolution.

I expect you to time one another. Holding each other accountable is important.

I try not to call for evidence, but I expect you to be prepared to hand any evidence requested to myself or your opponents ASAP.
