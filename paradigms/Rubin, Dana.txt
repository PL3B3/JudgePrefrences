I am a traditional judge with a strong preference for debate about the assigned topic/resolution and direct clash. I prioritize clear communication, and do not want to hear speed.

I am a communication consultant based in New York City. I provide content and strategic communications counsel to executives and other high-profile individuals, with a focus on thought leadership. Through tools of influence and persuasion such as speeches, presentations, articles, and op-eds, I help my clients advance their points of view and lead dialogues with stakeholders, policy leaders, the media, and other opinion makers on issues that are critical to their industry or cause. My career includes more than two decades as a print and broadcast journalist in the US and UK. I've written hundreds of articles for newspapers and magazines, and produced documentary-style TV segments. My passion is the written and spoken word.
