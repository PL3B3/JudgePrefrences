  I'm 22 and in my senior year of college at UW-Green Bay. I have judged Varsity Switch and Varsity LD in Wisconsin and some national tournaments for 4 years. As a debater, I did two years of VSS and two years of VLD. I qualified to the final round of 64 at NFL's in 2005 in LD. I currently assistant coach for Appleton West High School. I've judged about five tournaments (so about 20 rounds) on the VSS topic so far (as of 11/4/08).

In terms of argumentation, I will listen to pretty much anything. However - and this is most important - it is the job of the debater to weigh the round. You tell me what's most important and why it's most important. This is the most critical thing in a debate round, and far too few debaters ever get around to doing it. I will vote on T, and K's, although I do probably set a bit higher burden on the K. I'm not saying I won't vote on it, you just have to tell me why I should. If neither debater weighs the round, I revert to a policymaker, and will pick the best policy option in the round - status quo, case, CP, K Alt, etc.

I'm fine with speed, I am not fine with incoherent mumbling or what I refer to as 'hummingbird syndrome' - debaters going so fast that their voice goes up five octaves and I can't understand a word you say. I still use paper and pen. I will warn you a couple times if you are not clear, but if I'm not writing down your arguments, well, you didn't really make them, did you? Please be clear - it's way more important than getting in that warrantless impact card anyway. I prefer a traditional aff and neg strat - meaning the aff presents plan text and advantages, neg argues either T, framework, case, DA, K, CP, etc. For theory and K's, please slow down a bit more than you normally would.

In short, I'm not a typical Northeast Wisconsin judge, but I'm probably a bit more traditional than you'd like me to be. I'll give critiques, and if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me before the round.
