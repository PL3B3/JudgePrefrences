  I will default to a Policy paradigm if you don't give me another framework to operate under, but I'm not stuck to it, so if you give me a framework and the other team doesn't I'll use it. If there are competing frameworks, I'll pick the one that wins the framework flow.

That said, if I find your argument to be morally abhorrent for an obvious reason (you'd know if it was, I'm not going to surprise you,) I'm not above looking for excuses to vote it down. I enjoy the kritik and I'll vote on T if you give me enough to work with. Reasonability is the worst T no voter.
