  I debated for Austwell-Tivoli High School in the late 90s. I have been a full time debate judge for 10 years and have watched hundreds of rounds. I am currently a speech and debate coach at Jack. C Hays High School.

LD - I feel that it is entirely possible to hold true to the essence of what Lincoln Douglas debate is - a value debate including: logic, ethical values, and philosophy.

I think debate should be fun and educational, first and foremost. It should attempt to expand the mind by exposing people to ideas they may not have considered before or by forcing people to defend their ideas against what other people see as flaws in them.

CX- I am open to anything that is done well....meaning I want to see debaters that don't just rattle off card after card but can truly explain and have solid arguments. I feel it is important to do the same as I wrote above: be fun and educational, first and foremost. It should attempt to expand the mind by exposing people to ideas they may not have considered before or by forcing people to defend their ideas against what other people see as flaws in them.
