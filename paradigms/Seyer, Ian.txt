  Hey guys.

I don't want my philosophy to limit what you want to run.

I've been debating for 5 years. I ran mostly capitalism, dedev, derrida, deleuze and guatarri, and baudrillard. This does not mean, though, that I do not understand politics and won't vote on it. I have a high threshold on Kritiks.



I will vote for anything if you impact it.

Severance is probably bad.


Also, clear.
