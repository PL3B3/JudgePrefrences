I am neither a coach nor a debater, and as a result, I know little about terminology and strategies. As a Classicist, I can see many sides of an argument and dissect an argument. Therefore, if you do not want me to interpret various nuances in your case, interpret them for me.
Above all, I look for clarity of argument. As stated earlier, I expect you to lead me through the steps of your argument and to make connections between each piece of evidence. Avoid fancy rhetoric meant to impress your audience with your knowledge; you are not Cicero, and I will not be impressed. Your case should have no extraneous information nor should it leave me with any questions as to your point. I can tolerate speed, but only with very clear enunciation. If I cannot understand what you are saying, I will not give you the benefit of the doubt.
