I debated at Glenbrook South for four years. I was a 2A.

I am not the most familiar with the topic.

I'm generally open to vote on any argument and make my decisions based on my flow.
That said, I probably will not vote on incredibly offensive arguments.

Critiques: If you go one, make sure you explain it thoroughly, because I know very little about them. :.]

Topicality/Theory: Don't hesitate to go for it. I actually kind of like these debates if made interesting... :.]

Counterplans/Disadvantages: Yay! :.]

Cheating (clipping cards, etc.) or being an overly awful person is bad.
Stealing prep and being crude/disrespectful will probably lower your speaks.

*Extra speaker points if you speak in haiku.* :.]]]
