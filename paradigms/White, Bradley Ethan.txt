  My background: I have eight years of debate experience; three years of judging/coaching experience. I debated for
Thorndale High School (UIL, TFA, and TOC circuits), Baylor University (NDT and CEDA circuits), and Texas A&M University-Kingsville
(TIFA and NPDA circuits). I am currently the student coach for Texas A&M University-Kingsville.

General: There is no argument I won't listen to, so use your own discretion as to what to read and go for. I’ve
debated/coached all levels and styles, so I’m pretty much okay with anything. I will evaluate the round based
on the arguments and under the framework presented. Having said that, an argument is a claim and a warrant. When cross-applying or
extending an argument, the warrant must be included. However, don’t use this as an invitation to get sloppy on
the flow during your speeches.

Not-so-general/To be noted:
Theory/T: I have a somewhat high threshold for theory and topicality arguments. If you are going for theory, there
should be a great deal of comparative analysis. If you are going for topicality, there should be a significant doubt
to whether or not the affirmative is topical. Thus, I’m not against voting for these arguments, but you need to tell
me why I should vote for them.

K-esque Arguments: I am more familiar with these kinds of arguments, but don’t assume that I know what you
are trying to say. In addition to a well-articulated and specific link story, well-explained impact, and coherent solvency
story, you need to explain how your criticism matters in the particular instance of the debate round.

Delivery: I am fine with speed. However, I do believe that there is a tradeoff with speed and clarity. If you are
reading framework, procedural, or theory type arguments, you might want to adjust your delivery rate accordingly
[slow down]. These types of arguments require more pen time; again, use your own discretion.
