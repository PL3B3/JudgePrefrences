  Overall:
It is most important for quality of arguments and not quantity. I am fine with critiques as long as you explain them well. Please explain your arguments. It is important to explain your impacts and why they outweigh the other teams. Generally the team with the best analysis wins. Signposting is essential in order for not just the judge but the other team to follow the argument. I am an extremely open judge and I want each round to be enjoyable and educational for all.
