  I'll vote wherever you tell me to as long as you give me a good reason and please, dear God, let there be clash.

Speed-
Speed within reason is fine so long as you enunciate. I have no trouble following a fast round so long as I can follow you on the flow.

CX-
I tend to believe that this is where the round can be most easily won or lost. Take advantage of the time you are given, ask pointed questions without being an asshole. I won't drop anyone the round on ethics alone, but it will be more difficult for you to get my ballot if you are unnecessarily rude to your opponent.

Analytics/Evidence-
I don't preference one over the other so long as both are done well. If you and your opponent have differing philosophies on this matter, sell me yours and I will give you the ballot.

Theory-
Theory fine. I like theory debates so long as they are thoughtful. Don't run theory just for the hell of it.

Extension-
Everything should be extended through the warrant, I don't need to hear the card three times. Compare arguments and weigh them. Always.

Arguments-
Stock, Critical, whatever.
