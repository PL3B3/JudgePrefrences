  I debated policy for Edina High School in Minnesota for 4 years, from 2004-2008. I currently attend Creighton University in Omaha, and have not been actively involved in debate since, though I have judged at tournaments occasionally.

Current things Edina does should in no way be reflective of my preferences as a judge. I hate dedev. I actually hate it. When I debated for Edina, the kritik was not an argument we ran often.

I am 25% deaf in both ears, and as I’ve not been judging much in the past few years, you should probably avoid going at full speed. Clarity will be extremely important, and I will likely yell clear if I can’t understand you.

When I debated, I went for the spending disad a lot. I’m comfortable with any sort of disad and case debate, if you’re going for a counterplan that is questionably competitive, you should probably take care to explain it.

I am not up on recent debate trends, so saying things like “vote no” or “multiple worlds perm” will likely get you nowhere. Explain what your argument actually means, and you will be fine.

If you have any questions, ask me before the round.
