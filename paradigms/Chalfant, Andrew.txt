  I tend to view the resolution as a normative truth statement; it is the job of the affirmative to prove that the resolution is generally true, and the job of the negative to prove it generally false. Please don't imply that the resolution is constative or I will probably get upset. 
The most important part of the round is the standard; make sure to define it clearly and link your arguments appropriately. Theory arguments are fine, but please do not argue them to the point of exclusion. Weird arguments are also fine, just make sure to be clear. 
I will not intervene, nearly categorically. If you are horribly offensive in round I will probably not vote for you. I will stick to the flow. 
I have the following preferences: 
Well developed arguments carry more weight than a series of one-liners. 
Weighing is crucial; if you don't weigh, I have to decide how much I like each argument. 
There are two different, legitimate uses of hegemony. 
Moderate speed is fine, but I can only type so fast. 
If anyone challenges me on my decision in a rude or derisive way, I will drop the concerned debaters speaker points to the lowest allowable by the tab room.
