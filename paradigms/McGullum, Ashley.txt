  My name is Ashley McGullam and I have been a volunteer judge for BAUDL for the last year and a half and was a member of BAUDL Bears. This is where most of my knowledge of debate comes from.
I am open to all different forms of debate and always love to hear a good debate. I try not to get in the way of debate as much as possible and am flow oriented.
I would like as much context as possible and the more context the better. Evidence is important to me and should be as thoughtfully planned out as the debate itself.
The only aspect of debating that I am strict on is the timing. Do not go over the allotted amount of time.
 I tend not to be a fan of kritik because it seems to undermine the debate, but if it is done flawlessly then I am not entirely opposed
