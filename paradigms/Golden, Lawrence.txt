  I am a former Newark Science LD debater and coach. My judging paradigms and preferences are quite simple.

While I enjoy critical argumentation I need to know that debaters understand the constructives and arguments that they are running, so with that said I have four easy ways to get my ballot and any other questions can be asked before rounds begin.

1. K.I.S.S. Keep it simple stupid! I know that overly-complex and seemingly intelligent rhetoric are employed to make individuals sound polished and sadly to confuse opponents; however, it means nothing if I as a judge cannot comprehend what debater is talking about in the round, so please be sure to explain ideas so that they are conveyed to me as if i knew nothing about debate.

2. Remembering my laziness is critical. I am very lazy in the best sense possible because debate is an activity that demands people use dialogue to persuade the judge into a vote. Write the ballot for me! I prefer competitors to link, impact, weigh to standards in round and clearly, explicate reasons for why I should vote in a particular way. This is a good thing in that it helps me remove personal biases from decisionmaking process.

3.I am not easily offended. I will listen to pretty much any argument insofar it is warranted, explained, and shown to be important in the context of a round

4. Theory: I used to have a very high threshold for theoretical objections; currently, my tolerance has been substantially lowered, so be sure there is actual abuse, it applies to the debate, and is not just an attempt to obtain an easy technical win.
