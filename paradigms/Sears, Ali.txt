  Hi, I'm Ali Sears. I'm a freshman at the University of Illinois in Champaign.

Affiliations: Walter Payton College Prep (debate there 3 years as a 2A) and New Trier HS (debated there 1 year as a 2N)

I am open-minded towards all arguments and will vote for policy, critical, and meta-level arguments.

Theory and topicality are apriori issues; however I'll only vote on them if they are explained well.

I would prefer not to sit through an extensive framework debate because I normally don't hear impacts to framework explained well. I want to hear substantial arguments.

In the end, as long as your arguments are warranted and impacted, I'll vote for them.
