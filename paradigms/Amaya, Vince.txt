  I am a traditional judge, in the sense that I believe Lincoln Douglas debate ought to be a communications event. Thus, you should not spread in front of me. If I can't flow it, I cannot evaluate it. Otherwise, as long as you explain your arguments well, I can vote off of them. You should be very clear and voters are much appreciated.
