I graduated from Rancho Bernardo High School in 2011. I did LD for 4 years, and did some circuit debate my freshman-junior year. I am a freshman at Stanford.

I understand the basic structure of debate well. By that I mean, I understand how the value, vc, and offense function in LD. This means you can't just win by winning a framework in front of me, you have to win offense back to that framework as well. 

In terms of strategies, I don't really care how you choose to debate the resolution. Two caveats:
1. the more complicated you are, the more likely I am to make a bad decision. I haven't flowed since 12th grade, and even then I was a bad flower.
2. the faster you go, the harder it is for me to catch it. If you go full speed, I guarantee you I won't catch even half of ur args. Slow down to a medium pace for me please

Theory--I hate theory. I think its bullshit 99% of the time. However, I recognize some strategies are really unfair. I know nothing about competing interps vs reasonability, rather, I employ an in round abuse standard. If you can show that clearly the other persons args are unfair, then that is a reason I should exclude them. Theory is not a winning strat in front of me, so please don't go hard for it. You won't be pleased.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me before the round. You can also ask Paras Kumar, he was my teammate.
