  Judge Philosophy: Tom Lueker

I have experience debating/judging fast rounds and like for Topicality and tag lines to be slower than cards. I wont say clear or slow unless I'm having a lot of trouble, so if there are warrants in your cards that you want me to hear I encourage you to especially articulate those lines.

I default to a traditional "policy-maker" framework. If you are impacting within another framework it's very important that you explain how the BALLOT functions in that framework.

I will vote on anything clear, and would rather see one well developed argument rather than a long list of short ones. I absolutely love creative analytical arguments. I do NOT believe that an argument is meaningless unless it has a card.

I have a relatively low threshold for voting on procedural arguments (Topicality esp.), and a relatively high threshold for voting on critical arguments.

I listen to cross examination (though I don't put anything on my flow unless it's in a speech) and though I have no problem with tag team, (for speaker points) I like to see the CX led by the appropriate member.

Above all else treat each other with respect, be creative, and have fun!
