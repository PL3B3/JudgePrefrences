  I'm a college policy debater, and debated policy throughout high school. I know stuff about LD, but may not get a ton of your jargon. That being said, i'm ok with anything being read. I can evaluate just about any type of debate. I flow and use it a lot in my decision. Don't count on me reading your ev. You need warrants to make arguments. K's and theory arguments are fine--but I think all arguments need a warranted connection to the ballot. A lot of other thoughts can be found on my policy wiki.
