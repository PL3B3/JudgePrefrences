  I will compare how arguments by competing sides bear on a framing question which has been defined by the debaters for the particular round - i.e "is the affirmative good or bad? "Has the other team behaved or spoken ethically?" When the debaters have not defined the framing question of the round, I default to the question posed by the current resolution. I am generally inclined to teams that explicitly say "what the debate is about" and develop connections between specific arguments in the round and the overarching question of the whole debate. Beyond this, it does not seem necessary to say more than that the judge must do his best to support the most persuasively argued side.

Note: I will probably not know the topic or very much about it. 

I debated for Edgemont High School from 2003-2007, but have had limited interaction with the activity since that time.
