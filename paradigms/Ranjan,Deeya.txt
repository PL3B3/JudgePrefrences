  As a parent judge this is my first year of judging. I have previously judged public forum debates in other tournaments. I would prefer a clear audible medium-paced delivery of contentions. The standard should support the contentions. Debaters should be wary of presenting their evidences - it should not be done during cross-fire or final focus round.
 I vote on the following aspects -
 - Standard and how it links to the contentions that have been presented. 
 - Refutations, if it clearly outweighs the opponentâ€™s contention.
 - Overall performance

 Lastly, I expect the teams to be respectful and courteous towards each other at all times.
