  Hey there!

Background
I'm currently a first year at UCSB. My experience in debate doesn't really extend beyond a couple of years of high school public forum, so I think like a public forum debater (so, util is almost always right unless you have a really good reason otherwise, and evidence has to be very relevant and credible). I try to be as reasonable as possible, but I favor arguments that are more simply sensible over those more complicated (if your argument was stretched too complicatedly for me to follow, 1. I'm sorry lol and 2. Chances are there's a simpler, stronger, and more relevant argument you could have made/your opponent is going to make). I do appreciate complex arguments that make my brain want to explode but if you're going to win with one, you'll have to break it down for me well.
Also, in PF, kritiks pretty much almost never work. But I'm flexible and curious so if you have anything unique and interesting and think it would help you more than it hurts you, I would love to hear it.

Speaks
I probably won't give you less than 27.5 points.
pls just don't spread. pls. I'll tell you to slow down if I have to
Also, I appreciate civility and calmness.

Extra notes to anybody reading this
to debaters: If you're nervous, don't be nervous. Honestly, I'm ... basically the equivalent of a parent judge. Good luck!!
