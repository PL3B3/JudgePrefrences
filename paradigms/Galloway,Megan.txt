  I like to dance in the conversation and go with what the students come up I will go with the flow. Overall I am a stock issues judge. I am looking for real world logic. Impact calculus, if you are going to say that the population will be extinct you really want great evidence. I will analyze the quality of the source for the more legitimate the source , the stronger the arguments. If you are running a creative K, fine but have a well structured argument. I'm fine with speed but articulation is key. I do give points for style. Great presentation and persuasive argumentation will serve the student well in life.

I debated Lincoln Douglas in high school, and I majored in Theater Education at BYUI, in Idaho. I worked with a high school speech and debate team of 150 students in Rexburg .I am taking some gap time to serve as a missionary and will be judging debate until I leave. Thanks to all the coaches out there, you are making a real difference for your students.
