CX Philosophy: 
Civility is of paramount importance to me. This is an educational activity and it is meant to be an open forum for discussion. That can’t happen when everyone is being nasty. Mutual respect is important for those teachers, coaches, assistant coaches, judges, parents, administrators, and students that dedicate time and energy to this activity. 
I am a Policy maker. As a policy maker, affirmative’s must have a plan text and be a reasonable example of the resolution. The resolution does have meaning and it’s the affirmatives obligation to defend it. I have a rather high threshold for topicality debates. Too often “T” debates devolved to tag line “limits goods”;”limits bad” debate. I want to see the real abuse and ground loss to give the Neg my ballot. Counter plans are great. I love them. Plan inclusive c/p are ok if there is actual evidence that the random “Agent” would actually care. As with all debate arguments, the more specific your evidence … the better your kritik, dis/ad, case turn, counter plan, case advantage will be. That makes your job easier when telling a story and evaluating the round in the 2nr/2ar. It also prevents those horrible theory abuse debates from happening. Kritiks are fine, just explain the alternative. One final note: The last two rebuttals please weigh the round for me.
