  I have only been judging for less than a year but have a degree in Theatre and know what constitutes good speaking and acting. Concerning LD debate, I am a novice judge who is not comfortable with speed. I like solid arguments, with great framework and voters. I judged at Harvard last year and feel that I have a good grasp of what a great JVLD debate should be.
