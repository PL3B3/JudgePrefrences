I'm fine with everything except narratives, performances, poetry and the like. Go as fast/slow as you want. All the standard caveats about quality of argumentation, how intelligible you are, and your in round demeanor apply to these preferences. I really enjoy theory debates and will reward well executed strategies and punish poorly executed ones. Feel free to ask me any and all questions you have before the round.
