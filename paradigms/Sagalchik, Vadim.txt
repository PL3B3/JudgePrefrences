I debated three years at Stevenson High School, and participated in a few national tournaments including Glenbrooks and Harvard Congress.

I like clear honest debate that is supported by many facts.
I look for sign-posting and clear organization.
A good speaking style is very helpful; however, I prefer facts over flashy rhetoric.
