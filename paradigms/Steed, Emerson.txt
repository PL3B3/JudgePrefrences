As far as my judging philosophy goes, I prefer to be something of a policy maker... in the sense that I like the weighing of advantages and disadvantages and whether or not the case will actually solve. As far as kritiks and counterplans go, I didn't have that much experience with them, but feel free to run them understanding that their significance in the round will be lost on me. If you win the kritik but lose the round, its your fault, I warned you. My problem is that I'm a very logical person (look at my major) Oftentimes teams will run kritiks and the 'in round siginificance' or obscure generic alternatives, to me just don't hold the same ground with the real world impacts of other positions. Counterplans are a theory madhouse as well. Win me with logic. I love good analytics that have a strong warrant. No warrant, no weight. There must be direct clash! On case is good. I prefer quality over quantity. Feel free to read your evidence super fast, but the number of arguments doesn't give you a logical position. Don't be ashamed to read clearly and ununciate. You might get actually get higher speaker points because it sounds more professional...
