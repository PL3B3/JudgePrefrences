  I debated for Edmond Santa Fe in Oklahoma for three years. Now I'm at the University of Chicago, and I'm debating for its parli team, which is awesome.

My debate circuit was moderately traditional so if you run crazily progressive stuff in the round, chances are I won't know what you're talking about. That being said, I'm am open to vote on anything you persuade me to vote for. Also don't talk uber fast in the round. I won't be able to understand you, sorry. Just talk like a normal person and you'll be fine.

Don't be jerks to each other, have fun.
