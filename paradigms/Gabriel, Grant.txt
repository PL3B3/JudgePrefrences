  I went to Sage Ridge School in Reno and did varsity policy debate for four years. I twice competed at NFL Nationals in DX. I prefer case-based debate to framework and most theory. Framework should not make up the majority of your case. If you want to run a plan, do it. Critiques have their place in debate rounds, but not mine. I feel most critical argumentation is generic with cards recycled from 1997. I do not buy Nietzsche. A well-argued nuclear war impact will carry my ballot, but I am always up for fun, experimental arguments, provided they make sense. I can handle speed where necessary but am not a fan of spreading for its own sake. I graduated from Yale in 2017.
