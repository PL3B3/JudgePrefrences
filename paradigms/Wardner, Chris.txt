  I coach at Leland High School in San Jose, CA. I've been a coach for 20+ years.

I began my coaching career as a fast policy coach....but that was long time ago. I currently coach LD and Extemp and we are on the circuit occasionally, but not trying to make TOC. I'm open to almost any developed and warranted argument, but I don't judge circuit rounds often enough to keep up with fast debate. If you are willing to slow down, my flow will be much more accurate and I will be more likely to make a decision on the positions that you as debaters believed were key in the round.

1) Warrant your arguments and explain their function. A claim isn't good enough. Your extensions also need to be warranted/impacted/explained.

2) Weigh your arguments. I would rather not interfere in the round or have to interpret how you want your arguments to function. Do not leave it to me to determine what arguments matter most in the round. 

3) I am open to any warranted argument. I am open to kritiks as long as they are explained well, make sense, and are relevant to the topic(VERY IMPORTANT). Please do not spread a obscure philosophical theory and expect me to understand. You need to develop them better and not go too quickly. I will not pretend to understand something that I don't understand and wasn't articulated in round.

Speaker Points. I think they are important. I'm not going to give out points. They will be awarded based on the following: clash, weighing, topical arguments, strategic choices, focus on developing important args

Ask me any questions before/after the round and HAVE FUN!
