  Uh, don't call me judge!
My name is Rashed.


--Affirmatives --
Must be topical, unconditional, and better than the status quo
You should explain how "case outweighs";
how the plan uniquely solves for the impacts in the 1AC.
Must give an impact calc somewhere in your rebuttals, or I won't evaluate it!

One quick way I vote down a team is if you abandon your 1AC
b/c the status quo can always be an option for me,
or if the negative proves the aff is conditional.

Overall, Be able to funnel the debate to the world of the aff;
don't make me do your work!



--Negatives--
Must be competitive w/ the 1AC, but hey,
status quo can always be an option.
You should tell me what arguments you're going for in the 2NR
and funnel down the debate to the world of the neg.
