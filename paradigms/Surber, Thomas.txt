  I coach & judge high school debate in North Carolina.

IE
I rank the contestants as I see them. I expect smooth transitions between characters. I expect clear distinctions between character voices. Personification is huge. If the piece is supposed to make me laugh, then make me laugh. If it is supposed to make me sad, then I expect to be sad. The contestants that leave their comfort zones and really put themselves out there are going to get the stronger scores.

L-D
I look for the AFF to prove the resolution. I record every value, criterion, and contention, and watch carefully for drops. They should be symbiant toward achieving their aim. I like a smart cross x and I look for smart use of prep time. Please do not waste your cross x nor your prep time. I like to hear sources cited. If I get the impression that a source is fake, I will note that on the ballot. 

PUBLIC FORUM
I record every contention and look for drops. POFO can get heated, keep your bearing and composure. In the end, which team presented the more convincing argument? I don't care if you spread for time or strategic drops, but if I miss your contention it will cost you. 

POLICY
I look for the AFF to define a clear topicality as well as demonstrate a methodical case using a combo of inherency, harm, solvency, or desirability in their paradigm. I look for the NEG to challenge everything in the flow. Disadvantages and or counterplans that make sense are always welcome. I do not like the use of K's or semantical reindeer games.

STUDENT CONGRESS
Have a case prepared for EVERY piece of legislation. You never know where "your" bill is going to land in ways & means and it makes no sense to waste a Saturday by not speaking because your bill didn't make it to the docket. Ask good questions. If you are the PO, I look hard at longstanding. If a senator speaks twice before another senator has spoken once that is standing, you will get zapped. Do not rehash, vote on it and move on.
