  General Stylistic Preferences: I can handle the spread but would prefer the argumentation be clear so if the arguments are not clear when you spread, I cannot and will not vote off them. Persuasion is key, you need to paint the picture of how the round breaks down and outline what the most important issues of the round are, clearly impacting to the Standard.

Specific Argument Preferences: I prefer the substantive debate, though I will not drop you for running theory or topicality I need a clear ballot story to vote off theory. Also, there needs to be substantive evidence of in-round ause for me to vote off theory, potential abuse is not sufficient. Additionally, always impact clearly to the standards and weigh comparatively because it will make the story of the round much clearer. and in the 2AR /NR I look for clearly established worldview that is preferable to the other side.
