  My name is Ritesh Kumar.
I like clarity. I will remember things if you emphasize them, things like slowing down and extending work well. If you are consistent with that expect good speaks.
As for experience, I have judged in a couple of novice tournaments last season. I'm not too tolerant of jargon, and only weigh what I understand. If you tell me to consider something more than others, then I will.
I will take notes, I can't flow.
Good luck!
