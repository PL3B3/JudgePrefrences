Preferred Debating Styles/Arguments: Do not spread or talk too fast- if I can't follow you, I won't vote for you. The debate styles that I do are conducive to lots of analysis on a few arguments, so ensure that you go deep into what you say and don't say too many things that you can't warrant. Do not overuse debate lingo (e.g. 'cards') because usually when people do this, they are trying to make up for the fact that they can't substantiate their arguments. Do not use quotes or statistics without explaining why the quote is relevant to the debate, and what the quote means. I will not give any points for material that is not linked back to the framework of the case.

For cross-x, please ensure that you answer all questions as directly as possible, and focus on undermining your opponents' arguments and catching them in logical traps. Emphasize doing well in cross-x. It's the only chance you get to directly attack your opponents' arguments- don't waste it.

For rebuttals, I do not want to hear a constructive speech, as in just a rehashing of old arguments. I want to know what are the biggest points of clash in the round, and why you or your team have won on them. I weigh the rebuttals very heavily in my final decision, so ensure that you do well in them.

You do not need to refute every point made by your opponent(s) to win the round. Hit the major ideas.
