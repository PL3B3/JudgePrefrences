  Background:
Very limited debate background, though I had a fairly extensive speech career during high school. I currently attend NYU Tisch. 

Spreading:
Nopeynopenope. 

Theory:
Nope good sir. 

K’s:
All I know is my name starts with one. 

Counter plans:
I feel like these really strengthen the neg case, and give me a better sense of the neg world. Highly encourage. :) 

Grounds for losing speaker points:
Don’t be a dick to your opponent. 
Don’t be a dick to me. 
Don’t cite evidence you can’t produce. 
Don’t cut off your opponent. It’s super dickish, and I hate it. Especially if you’re the one asking the questions. 
Going over time limit. The timer goes off - you stop.

Grounds for high speaker points:
Referencing hip hop in any fashion. Seriously, you could be obscure as you want and I will probably get it and appreciate it. 
Speaking clearly and dynamically 
Display good improvisational skills (bringing up disclosure theory is the opposite of this...avoid disclosure theory)

Other:
I’ll try my best to flow, but I’m not a debater at heart, so consistency with argument is key. 
Have fun! But not too much fun. 
Define V/VC well. Very well. 
Denotative definitions don’t seem sufficient to me. Connotative definitions are important. 
I encourage you to cross-time your opponent. 

Evidence call:
Produce your evidence in a reasonable amount of time. If you read it in your case, I expect you to have it within 60 seconds or so. 
Prep time can start after called evidence is brought over.
