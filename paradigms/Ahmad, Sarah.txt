Debate background: I competed in public forum debate, oratory, domestic extemp, and congress in high school. 

I primarily judge public forum debate. Overall, I want a round that is clear, logical, and covers a lot of ground. 

Framework: I like having some sort of framework to use to weigh the round. Make sure you have some sort of justification for it. If both sides offer contradicting frameworks, each team must say why their framework should be used to weigh the round.

Evidence usage: There HAS to be evidence to back up your point or I will assume that you made it up yourself. When stating the evidence, please tell me the source as well. Also, when you repeat your evidence in a later speech, repeat the main point of the evidence as well instead of just saying "flow across the Smith card." The impact of the evidence must be emphasized. As a side note, I also despise evidence wars that come down to arguing the date or source of a card rather than what it says. Tell me WHY the opposing team's evidence should not be relevant. 

Speed: In public forum, you should not talk too fast at the point at which you are spreading. I should be able to understand what you are saying. Remember as a judge, you want to convince me of a certain side and when you talk too fast a lot of that persuasiveness is lost. 

CX: I will take notes on the big turns or topics that come up. Don't be rude though either. Extreme aggression will work against you. 

Overall, being clear and logical will win you the debate.
