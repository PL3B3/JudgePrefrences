  I have judged at a number of California tournaments in Varsity LD, through final rounds.

I follow the general standards of Eastern style thinking, high on Confucius values. I do not focus on spreading. Logic works, but only when it's not in conflict with said values. Presenting ideas in a convincing way is the best; evidence is not something highly valued.
