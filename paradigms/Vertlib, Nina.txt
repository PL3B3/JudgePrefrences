  I debated for four years for Monte Vista High School, both on the local and national circuits. That said, I graduated in 2007, so it’s been a while. My preferences are not particularly strong, except for one: I have lost any ability I had to flow speed. If I can’t understand you, I will ask you to be clear – but I will not vote on arguments I did not catch the first time around. 

Substantively, my preference is for positional cases with unique, topic-specific warrants. I like framework debate. However, you should feel free to run whatever you prefer in front of me – I am a reasonably intelligent college student (or I like to think so) and will make every effort to understand your argument. I enjoy creative positions and will reward them with higher speaker points. Off case arguments are fine. I’m not the biggest fan of policy-adapted arguments. Kritiks are fine, but you’ll need to make sense (as with any case). I love burdens/ burden standards. If you believe that something in the round has gone wrong, you should feel free to run theory. I am not inclined to buy spurious violations, and I expect you to make it very clear to me how I should pull the trigger on those arguments. On a related note, I particularly enjoy when debaters weigh and give me an order in which I should evaluate arguments in the round. It’s a great way to get high speaker points. 

Speaking of speaks, I start at a 27.5 and move up or down from there. 

Please be fair, courteous, and persuasive. I am a very expressive judge – just look up once in a while.
