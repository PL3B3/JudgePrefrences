  I debated in policy for Chaminade High School in Southern California. 

I didn't get too deep into the activity, so please avoid spreading.

I am most comfortable when the debate is slower and emphasizes reasonable policies that could be passed in the real world.

I do have a soft spot for critical positions, so long as they're not "too far" out there and focused on real, material change.
