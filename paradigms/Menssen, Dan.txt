  Background
 I have competed in parliamentary, policy, and LD debate at the college level.I did not debate in high school.I currently debate policy for The University of Minnesota.I am a double major in Physics and Philosophy. This means: I love critiques and other philosophically oriented arguments, but please actually know what you're talking about.
Judging Philosophy
 There are no arguments that I hate.Logos > Ethos > Pathos. I do not care how well dressed you are.I like when people take risks, and when they push the limits of the format.
No one is tabula rasa. Here are some of the things that are on my tabula:
 I have a strong personal belief that there will not a be a nuclear war before the end of this year.I find the link story of most criticisms dubious.Defense alone cannot win a debate of any format.
Finally, none of the above should ever take precendent over the things you say.
Unless, of course, you tell me it should (wait...)
