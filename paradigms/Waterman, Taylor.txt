  I did policy debate all 4 years of high school. Though I have only judged one tournament this year so I don't know the literature yet.

Speed: I am good with you going as fast as you want as long as your clear, if for some reason you are too fast I will let yell speed. This won't cost you speaks as long as you were clear just to fast. But more likely it will be because you are not clear. I will yell clear once but only once.

Topicality: I don't love it but I understand why it can be good. Please don't run it as a time suck. And of you run it make it clear why they are not topical I won't vote on potential abuse.

Theory: simular to topicality.

DAs: I have no problem with them what so ever. For these debates I like the focus to he on the link story and impact calc.

CPs: I like them when run with a good bet benefit.

Ks: I like them. I don't know the literature on them for this topic so as long as you explain them there will be no issues.

All in all I don't want to be a burden on the debate. Debate the way you feel comfortable. I don't mind tag team cross x as long as it remains mostly on the intended two. Good luck.
