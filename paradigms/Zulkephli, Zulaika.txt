  I've had more experience in BP debating than APDA but have my roots in Asian Parliamentary Debate. I prefer and appreciate constructive debate that lays out comparison between both arguments. I prioritize debate that works on building their own argument and showing how it beats out the other instead of criticizing the other team's points. I think speaking slowly and getting the audience to hear the key points is much more important than saying a lot of words. Not too fond of K's
