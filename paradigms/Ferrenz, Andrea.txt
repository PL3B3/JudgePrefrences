  Profession: attorney with experience in public policy, litigation, and public-speaking

I value good authorities and good use of those authorities. I am not swayed by conclusory statements when you haven't laid a foundation with authorities. 

Courtesy and respect for opponents is required. If I perceive a lack of courtesy in tone or words then I will penalize. 

I keep time and appreciate it when participants do as well, both for speaking and prep. 

As in life, your rate of speaking is your choice. If I cannot understand you then it will be rather hard for you to persuade me of your position.
