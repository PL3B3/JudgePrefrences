  I am a tabula rasa judge that wants to see a debate about the topic- not a debate about the rules of debate. I expect competitors to be civil to one another throughout the round.

Excessive speed should be avoided as I feel that the purpose of debate is as a communication activity - not a weight and measure of which side can dump more arguments on the flow. 

Excessive Pre-Round coaching or asking for plan text prior to the round is not acceptable. Should debaters choose to engage in such practices, they do so at their peril. 

Debaters are welcome to ask specific questions prior to the round beginning, I'm happy to answer.
