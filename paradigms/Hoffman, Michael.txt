As a general rule, go for what you are most comfortable with and
confident in. Having said that, remember to contextualize any strategy
to the round. Clarity is a must, and less good evidence is better than
a lot of bad evidence. Evidence comparison is great, and cross-x is
important. Regarding specific arguments, below are some
predispositions, but you can always persuade me otherwise.

Topicality – Both teams should have an interpretation, preferably one
with evidence that’s contextual to this year’s topic. Also be warned,
I haven’t judged many debates on this year’s resolution, so you should
be careful with acronyms and discussions of what the core of topic is.

Disads – Disad debates, including those with counterplans and case
arguments, were some of my favorite to participate in in high school.
For the neg, case specific strategies are ideal and all debaters
should remember to do clear impact framing and comparison.

Counterplans – the best are those that are well researched and have
good solvency advocates. Offsets, Consult, and other process
counterplans are probably not competitive.

Ks –The more specific your links are to the aff the better. Be clear
about your alternative and the framework for evaluating the debate.

Theory – Usually a reason to reject the argument. Theory debates that
are fast are generally not enjoyable, so slow down and construct your
arguments carefully as a reason to reject the team.
