  Hello! I'm Nick Cox!
I'm a student at George Mason University and compete on the Speech Team there. In fact, I was the Tournament Director at this past years Patriot Games tournament.

As for my judging philosophy, it's pretty straightforward. I'm a stickler for good articulation -- pretty standard. Even though this is somewhat against the current high school Policy Debate trend, I really don't care about your "speaking speed." Sure, speak fast, I can follow. However, don't feel as if you must speak at a non-oxygen-friendly speed. I will be focusing mostly on your arguments. That being said, I do look for a few other small things... such as courtesy and respect.
I certainly allow for T's in my rounds -- but please don't over do it. Please.
Additionally, I have no issue with spreading. If you like to list a multitude of reasons that you're correct, that's fine. However, I will not dock the other team if they are unable to fully retort each point. The time limits aren't set by you; if they were, I'd be anxious to hear these speeches ad nauseum.

I know some judges dislike the use of theory in arguments -- I have no problem with them.

Ultimately, I like to know that you are learning something from your years in debate. Learn some communication skills... this goes back to my personal vendetta against needing to speak quickly.
Make your debating style personal to you.

You'll notice I'm not a tough and critical guy. Have fun, make friends!



LOVE,
NICKCOX
