  Hi Folks!

I haven't been connected to the debate community much in the last two years so I am excited to be judging again for my favorite tournament of all time: The Berkeley Invitational. 
You may be already groaning having heard I haven't been in touch with all the latest arguments or even the resolution and I'm really sorry about that, I remember kind of hating that myself. But do know I will be doing my best to ensure that I am attentive, my mind is open and my adjudication is impartial.

Rather than go through a list of arguments I am for or against I would instead like to give you some words of encouragement: Do whatever the heck you want. Having now entered the world of actual politics and policymaking, rife with averse risk co-workers and real repercussions for even the slightest slip ups, I implore you to utilize your creativity and make this space your own. If that means having a regular ol' spreading intense, in the weeds policy debate, awesome. If that means getting wacky, weird, performative, EVEN BETTER, GO WILD. All I know is spaces like the ones you are about to create are few and far between when your career in debate is over and you really should make the most of it. I'm here to learn as much as you are and I hope y'all give me a great show to talk to my non debate friends about. 

My only request: when I say slow down, do slow down. Which is different then when I say clear....that means please enunciate better. If my memory serves me correct, I've rarely had a problem with speed, it's almost always an issue of clarity. 

Also, I WILL be asking you for flow paper.

My Experience: I did policy debate in high school for 3 years, coached during college for another 3, and did one year of College Parli for UCLA. Post Debate, I've done a term of Americorp teaching music and job skills to youth at a non profit in East Oakland and currently work in Oakland City Hall doing communications for the council member of West Oakland.
