  I am a former debater from University School and I have competed in LD and PFD, more so PF than LD though. 

I am enjoy a standards debate when judging LD and I refuse to vote for a debater that hasn't linked into a standard to weigh the round. That being said I also want students to weigh all of the arguments in the round if they expect them to be evaluated at the end of the round on my flow. I also want students to give me very clear voters at the end of the round, I will not evaluate something that a debater does not clearly tell me to evaluate. I expect clear signposting throughout the round. I can can handle some speed but not too fast. I can deal with higher amounts of speed if you try and ease me into it. I am not opposed to you using speed as long as you use it to try and increase the analysis of the arguments you are putting out and not to just put out dozens of worse arguments
I prefer not to have to evaluate theory or apriori arguments but I will do so if that is the way the debate needs to go. If theory is necessary then it needs signposting otherwise I am not going to be able to evaluate the argument.
