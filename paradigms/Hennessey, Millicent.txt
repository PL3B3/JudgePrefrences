The Nightingale-Bamford School ‘12Debated Public Forum in HS, and now transitioning to Policy.I’m down for anything, as long as you are making strong arguments—claim, warrant, and impact. Throughout the debate, answer the question: Why is your argument better than your opponents?I am not completely familiar with all the policy jargon/ techniques so be EXTREMELY clear and don’t resort to being overly technical. If I don't get it down on my flow, make sure I do next time.The K makes me cringe, but I won’t vote you down if your links are applicable and you explain it.Cross-ex should not be wasted. Don’t abuse your opponent, but make it clear you know more than he or she. I always appreciate wit (wit wins you speaks), but I especially enjoy an amusing CX.Golden Speaking Rules:
1. Speaking loudly/clearly comes before speed.2. Don’t be arrogant or obnoxious during the debate—it takes away from your ethos.3. Relax and have fun.4. You do you.
