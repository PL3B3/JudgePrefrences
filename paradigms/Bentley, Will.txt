  This is my first year serving as the assistant LD debate coach at Barrington High School. Previously, I have coached Public Forum debate.

For LD, I need to hear and understand a clear, logical link between your value and value criterion, and through your contentions. Evidence needs to support your claims and must be warranted. Also, I pay close attention to what arguments are attacked and what arguments are dropped/extended. Make this clear to me by signposting.

As far as speed goes, I need to be able to understand and flow your arguments.
