  Background:
I debated for four years on the national circuit for Ft. Lauderdale High School from 2002-20006. I recently (2010) completed my degree in political science and global development studies and will be starting law school in the fall (2011). I have judged on and off since 2006, but have judged more extensively on the current topic and have a pretty broad understanding of our military and police actions in the debated regions. This year I have also expanded my role to cutting cards for/assisting the Ft. Lauderdale policy squad. 

Specific Preferences: 
The more specific clash there is in the round the more I will enjoy the debate. I don't care what arguments you choose to run in the 1nc. Just run what you think is most strategic. I really enjoy good theory/topicality debates, well thought out CPs, and tricky disads. When you read topicality or theory please slow down a bit. Other than that I shouldn't have an issue with your speed. I don't care how smart you are -- don't be an ass in CX. The only reason I'd ever enjoy hearing a consult cp in the 1NC is if the 2AC tears it apart. Some things are just objectively true: like consult cps suck, consult cps are theoretically illegitimate, etc.. Also.......if you want to actually win my ballot my final advice would be to do some terminal impact calculus in your final rebuttal. 

If you have any more specific questions ask me before the round. Just debate well.
