  Background: My background in Forensics is more of IE but I am currently coaching at The Altamont School in Birmingham, AL and the team is composed of mostly PF. I have since judged PF at multiple tournaments and found that this debate appeals to my personality more than I imagined it would.

PF Philosophy: This style of debate is based on evidence presented and argued in a logical manner. I believe the team that wins is the one that proves their case's consequences to have a greater impact then the other. This could mean a combination of contentions or just one powerful contention. I place a strong emphasis on logical argumentation but I also believe it is the duty of the opposing side, not the judge, to point out logical errors. I like aggressive debating, I believe all arguments are fallible in some form so teams should emphasize breaking down their opponents case. Lastly, I enjoy aggressive and heated crossfires that maintain civility, passionate yet polite.
