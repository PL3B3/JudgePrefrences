  I'm a political science major at the University of South Dakota, and an assistant policy coach at Sioux Falls Lincoln High School. I debated for Watertown High School back in the day. I'd consider myself a fairly basic policymaker. At the same time, I'll listen to anything. Really, I just want an in-depth, well articulated debate where both teams have clearly thought out their positions and have some idea of a strategy. I don't really like teams that hope arguments stick. Like most judges, I want you to make my job as easy as possible. Tell me exactly how to vote and why--this means impact calculus, and comparing the aff plan to the status quo or counterplan. On a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the fastest. I'd consider myself a 6 or 7. I need it comprehensible so go as fast as you want as long as its clear. In summary, I'd like to hear rounds with disads, counterplans, and in-depth solvency debates, but I'll listen to anything if you think you can win it.
