  I did policy in high school, though I dabbled in LD and PF. I now coach LD. I am most comfortable with critical arguments, but am not opposed to more traditional debate. I'm fine with speed. I encourage you to do what you like and will often defer to debaters. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.
