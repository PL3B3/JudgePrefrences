Strikes: Oxford Academy

Experience: 2 years LD in HS, 3 years NPDA parli (csu long beach).

Speed: Speed is fine as long as you are clear

I default to policymaker: whether or not the advantages of the aff plan outweigh the disadvantages or a competing policy option.

Counterplans: I generally err neg on dispo and pics debates. Every other theory argument is debateable.

Kritiks: I think Kritiks should have an alt, and they should probably have a text to that alt. Donâ€™t assume I know anything about your kritik.

Topicality: T is a voting issue. The neg needs to win either actual abuse or that competing interpretations is a good standard for debate. Default to competing interpretations in the absence of any framework by the debaters.

Performance: Performance is fine as long as you give me a framework for how to evaluate performance against what the other team does.

Theory (ASPEC, etc.): Hard to win unless there is proof of abuse
