  I debated 4 years at Ruston High School and have coached the following 2 years at Ruston High School.
This is my fifth year to judge policy debate and I consider myself a tabula rosa judge.
When reading fast, make sure I can distinguish between the tag and the card. I can handle speed as long as there are clear transitions between tags and from card to card.
It is very hard to offend me, but courtesy is very important to me as well. I may dock speaker points for rudeness against your partner or opponent especially when it isn't funny or witty.

Framework:
Althought I lean policy i will vote on critical arguments (both affirmative cases and negative arguments) If fiat is debated in the round, I need strong standards of why fiat is bad/good on both sides.

Topicality:
I have voted Neg on topicality in the past. I believe however, that if the negative goes for topicality, they should have a wonderful in round abuse story. I find it almost impossible to vote an affirmative team down on potential abuse alone. Standards are incredibly important to me, so argue them well if you want to win a T debate.

Counterplans:
This is my favorite negative argument! Conditionality doesn't bother me as long as you argue the theory well!

Critiques:
Make sure to outline an understandable link scenario! Explain the story to me well and I'm cool!
