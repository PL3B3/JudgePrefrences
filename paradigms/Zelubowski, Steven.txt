  Judging Paradigm

I was a Lincoln Douglas debater in high school, and now I coach debate at Chaminade High School. I am a traditional judge. I do not like speed or jargon. If you speak quickly, I cannot understand you, and your arguments will not be on my flow. If it isn’t on the flow, it doesn’t count.
I expect debaters to debate the topic at hand and not off topic arguments. These do not weigh in my judgment. I do not care if you think that the topic is unarguable, that the wording makes it impossible, or that giving you a win will satisfy some global injustice. I just want you to debate.
Logic, clear thinking, and clear delivery are what I am looking for. If you give me these, I will give you the win and high points.
