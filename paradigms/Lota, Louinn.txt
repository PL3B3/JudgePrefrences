Philosophy

 I want clear and well-supported arguments presented in a logical and intelligent manner. Clear communication is preferred, although some speed is acceptable.

 Also, a true debater is in control of his/her body. Distracting mannerisms count heavily against a score, in my book. Therefore speaking at speeds that defy understanding will both be distracting (as will the vein pulsating wildly in your neck) and loud gulps of air are inappropriate.

Disadvantages and Counterplans are good, I think they're smart and produce easier cost benefit analysis.

I don't necessarily have the best understanding of Kritiks, but I will try to understand what you are talking about, but in the speeches, I'd like a clear explanation of the alternative, and everything that it entails.

Being offensive will oblige me to force an auto-loss on you, so please, be civil in your debates.
