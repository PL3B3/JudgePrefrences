T- I do not really like T, I was the type of debater that scream T is genocide! in my rounds.

DA - are cool I think they make debates interesting ,specific DAs to case are even better .(I hate generic DAs)

CP- I hate non-competitive counter plans I think they are a waste of time.I am not comfortable voting on theory thats why I try to stay away from counter plan flow as possible when it comes to making a decision. (That's a hint not to run it)

K- I use to be a performance debater ,and I hold Ks to a higher threshold. I do love a good K debate just because you run them does not mean that I will vote for it .You have to make sure the link is clear,the alternative and impact is clear .You also have to be very responsive to the other teams arguments against the k .(Analysis is really important)

I love a good case debate ,Personally I always find myself voting neg because 9 out 10 the AFF does not know how to defend their case .
I think in that situation a line by line would be good unless you say otherwise.

Framework

I Hate Traditional policy-making framework, stop complaining about loosing ground get over it!
but its whatever it comes down to competing interpretations and why your interpretation is good for education.

*Fact: I have not judge any debate rounds about this Latin America topic, Ridge will be the first time that I do, so please be clear and explain any terms I should know.


Have Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
