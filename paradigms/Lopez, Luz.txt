  Hi my name is Luz Lopez. I was a debater in high school for all four years at St. Vincent High School. I am currently a student at SRJC and hoping to aspire great things. Although I do not debate in college and I am very familiar with pretty much all debate arguments. 

I am unaware of the debate topic this year so I expect you explain to me what is to make it easier for all of us. 

I enjoy K debates, needless to say I won't listen to other arguments. Please read and defend arguments you understand rather than ones chosen by your teammates and coach(es). You will learn a lot more if you deconstruct each argument and explain to its fullest. I would rather listen on a debate with strong points than multiple pointless strategies.

If you would like to ask more questions on specific debate arguments, feel free to email me at luzlopez8301@gmail.com. If not, you can ask me when as soon as I walk into the room of the debate. 

Lastly, the most important thing to keep in mind is this is a debate and to have fun.
