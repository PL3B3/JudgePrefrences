  Ex debater who debated at Grady HS. Debated at Emory University. Director of LD at Emory National Debate Institute (2008-2010).

My preferences are very simple: make solid arguments, tell me why they are important, and tell me why you win. I will consider any type of argument as logn as it is well explained and justified via warrant(s)/impact(s)/link(s). I like a good values/standards debate so please have something substantial to link and impact back to. I don't like to intervene and decide based on what is active in round, so you need to carify your position, make your impacts clear and weigh extensively. I will not make that analysis for you even if I know where you are headed. 

Theory and T: I tend not to like these arguments and will only vote on them if clear abuse is demonstrable and the arguments are extended and impacted well.

Speed: I am ok with speec coupled with clarity. If you are not clear, I will let you know and if you still are not clear then the decision will be made on what I managed to get down. Please do not sacrifice clarity or analysis just to fit in a few more cards.
