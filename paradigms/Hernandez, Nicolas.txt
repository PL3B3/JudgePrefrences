  I debated for St. Ignatius in San Francisco, CA. This is my first year judging. I'm open to most arguments as long as I can understand them. I try to intervene in the round as little as possible. I am not good with critical arguments because my knowledge of philosophy is limited, so run them somewhat slowly and explain them well. I am okay with a decent amount of speed and you can go fast on cards etc, but I don't judge a lot so I may not know all the topic-specific jargon. Please be slow on theory debate as debaters tend to make many short arguments on this subject; go slowly if you are making short arguments. I'm fine with theory and like to hear good theory debates. Against poorly developed or bad theory arguments I accept reasonability claims and RVI's. I like unique arguments. I like good evidence and tend to give it the most weight. Empirical claims must be backed up by causal warrants. I like good weighing and tend to look at well weighed claims. I will disregard arguments that are factually false or blatantly offensive, as well as extended warrantless blips. I default to a competing worlds interpretation and prefer it, but I'm fine with a criterion. I prefer it when debaters can agree on a standard or weigh their standards in relation to each other. I like to be entertained, especially with comedy, but rudeness is bad. I have a higher threshold for a priori arguments, but if they are well warranted they are okay. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me before the round. I try to average 27ish speaks.
