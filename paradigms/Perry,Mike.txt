  I tend to view myself as conservative and traditional judge. I have coached for twenty years and over the past two years, I see reason for real concern. I fear that Lincoln Douglas has become single person policy. Lincoln Douglas is a persuasive event and based on philosophy not theory and the spreading of cards. I truly enjoy individuals that are organized and can articulate clearly the impacts of evidence and connect the evidence appropriately to their position. If you claim a comparative advantage, then be prepared to support it with evidence that actually links clearly back to a specific piece of evidence your opponent used. I prefer to hear arguments proving the disadvantages or why implications may not answer framers intend. I am not overly fond of kritikâ€™s but I will listen and I have voted on them when they are well presented and supported by evidence and understood by both Debaters. I flow fairly well but, if you use speed you must have clarity of speech. I think the spread is not really necessary if your research and understanding of the resolution is sufficient. I tolerate this practice, but I no longer condone it as the primary offensive tool that students do.
