Experience- I have been involved with L/D debate since 1980 as a judge and a coach of NFL qualifiers. 
Philosophy I am a traditional L/D judge. Both sides have the burden of proof to present and weigh the values as well as the central arguments. Your value premise needs to be accrued by giving me a weighing mechanism (like the value criteria) to measure your contentions. I am looking for the side that best upholds the resolution) or vice versa). The best way to prove your case to me is by both philosophical evidence AND analysis.
 I try to never allow my personal views on the topic to enter into my decision - I won't make assumptions as to what I "think" you mean. 
While for the most part I am a "tabula rasa" judge, I do have a few things that I dislike and will bias me against you during the course of the round either as it relates to speaker points or an actual decision. 
Here they are-
1) I believe that proper decorum during the round is a must. Do not be rude or insulting .Donâ€™t yell at me or swear.
2) Both sides must tell me why to vote "for" them as opposed to simply why I should vote "against" their opponent. 
3) I am not a big fan of speed. You are more than welcome to go as fast as you want, but if it is not on my flow, then it was not stated, so speed at your own risk. Spreading evidence that is merely blurted out (and not broken down into claim, warrant and impact) will NOT get my ballot.
4) I am not a big fan of critiks, counterplans, or specious topicality arguments.
