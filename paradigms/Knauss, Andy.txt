---> Speed is fine. I will call clear if need be, but I will most likely be able to flow you.
 (I call cards if I need to confirm what I flowed/spell a card correctly. Don't bother re-reading the same old tired warrants throughout the round, just reiterate.)

---> During your own prep time, you may share cases, ask points of clarity, pontificate on the meaning of life, whatever you wish.
 (None of what is mentioned during this time will be used by me while adjudicating the round, I'll likely be busy tagging and cleaning up my flow.)

---> Traditional as well as Non-traditional (Theory, Topicality, DA, CP, K) are acceptable. 

---> I will generally keep time just in case one of your timers has a catastrophic failure. 

---> I am rather non-interventionist. I will essentially let the flow and your analysis do my deciding.

---> Persuasion is for PF. I view LD as a more progressive/values debate. If you give me persuasion without links/warrants/impacts I will drop you.

---> If you get below a 27 from me, you will get a very detailed explanation as to why.
