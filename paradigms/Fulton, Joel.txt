  I have about 8 years of involved debate experience.  I debated for three years at Westside High School in Omaha, NE, and for a year and a half at Emory University in Atlanta, GA.  I have worked at summer camps for middle and high schoolers, and have instructed debate during the school year.  However, I have been away from the activity the previous two years.  I am now in my first year at the University of Nebraska College of Law. 

As far as paradigm goes, I am open to most arguments.  I just want to be persuaded.  I want to see the students debate their best arguments.  If a debate must be critical, it should be well done.  I would rather see bad policy arguments than bad critical arguments.  I do appreciate creativity in round and encourage the debaters to innovate from within themselves. 

I'm a big believer in offense versus defense.  The team that does the best job handling their opponent's arguments, not just their own, will probably win. 

I evaluate T and theory just like any other argument on the flow.  In that sense debaters will be best served if they establish a framework for which the round should be evaluated and then win they best support that framework.
