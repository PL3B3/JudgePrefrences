  Hi everyone!

Just a little about me: I debated for Harrison High School in New York all 4 years of High School and graduated in 2012. I won a few tournaments and competed in many regional and local tournaments. Now I currently am junior at Binghamton University.
I guess I can be considered a traditional judge in terms of preferring substantive debate rather than theoretical jargon, although I am not opposed. Toward the end of my debate career I started to run Ks and theory, but if you are going to run these type of arguments you must present them SLOW and CLEARLY.
If you speak very fast and spew words at me, I will:
A) Probably not flow it
B) Give you terrible speaks
C) Not understand what you are saying
With that being said, PLEASE SPEAK CLEARLY AND YOU WILL GET GOOD SPEAKS. This doesn’t mean that you can’t speak fast but make sure that you actually can without stuttering/slurring/deep inhales…etc.
I prefer to hear arguments that actually make sense, are convincing, and have good evidence to back it up. CONVINCE ME J
Also, do not argue with me after the round once the decision has been made and please demonstrate good sportsmanship. This activity is supposed to be fun and educational, not malicious and vicious. I definitely know what it feels like to lose a round and to “blame the judge” so I will try my best to be extremely impartial and listen to both sides even if I don’t buy the argument.
