  I will default policy maker, but will vote however you tell me if you're persuasive. I debated all 4 years of high school at Sioux Falls Lincoln out of South Dakota and enjoyed every out of state tournament we could fit in the schedule. I like topicality, but probably won't vote for it unless you go all in on the argument. I enjoy kritik and CP debate, just no performative contradictions. If you run a kritik as a time suck you'll probably annoy me. I love impact calc. I'll even vote on inherency.
