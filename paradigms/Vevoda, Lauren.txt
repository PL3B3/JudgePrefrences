I believe that this is your debate and you should be able to run the arguments you want. However, that does not mean I don’t have opinions on certain things. 
 
Topicality-I usually default to a framework of competing interpretations. However, if the affirmative tells me why this is a bad framework and should be rejected they could probably sway me. On T I hate the generic blocks that both the aff and neg read on why T is or is not a voter. Please make your arguments specific to what is happening in the round and indict the other team’s stance. 
 
Kritiks- I am not the best judge for these debates. That is not to say I don’t vote on them but I am not as up on the literature as some other people. I typically need the negative to explain how their kritik functions in relation to the affirmative and how that prevents the affirmative from solving. Please do not just use kritik jargon, explain your arguments well so that I understand them. 
 
CP’s, DA’s and Case debates are my favorite. I love these in any fashion. 
 
Theory- I feel like theory has turned into something that people only go for when they are losing everything else. I feel like conditionality and PICS are probably ok. However, I vote against these things from time to time. Once again if you are going for these arguments please make them specific to the debate you are having and to what your opponent is saying. 
 
A couple of other things: Please be nice, especially to your partner. I hate when someone always interrupts their partner’s speech or makes that person seem inferior. Also, please do not clip cards. If I am sure that you are clipping I will vote against you.
