  I debated for Damien High School for four years. Although I enjoy critical debates more I’m perfectly fine with policy debates as long as you make clear arguments. I think debate is a much more a game than an educational activity. I will listen to anything. Make smart arguments and explain why they matter. The more time you spend on a single argument can mean a lot more than time spent on making a bunch of other arguments. Explain why an argument matters, if you don’t I won’t do the work for you. If you make me laugh I’ll give you high speaks.
