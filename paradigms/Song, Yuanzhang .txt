  I am a parent judge affiliated with Westford Academy.

I will do my best to follow you, but cannot handle speedy or overly technical debate. 200 words per minute is my maximum allowance, but please be clear no matter what. I have a relatively traditional paradigm and will only vote on more progressive arguments if it can be explained with a minimum amount of jargon and the argument is somewhat intuitive. Please keep your jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy. Interesting and clearly well-thought-out positions will also be rewarded, but offensive arguments will be punished.
