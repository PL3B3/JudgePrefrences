  University School (FL)

I am an assistant coach and Technical Theatre Director at University School. As a former Director of Forensics and Debate class instructor, I'm familiar with all forms of debate. I am a traditional judge and want to see a clear value/criterion debate with logical contentions that link back to the standard. I do not want to see a mini policy round. Please communicate your arguments clearly and in a reasonable speed.
