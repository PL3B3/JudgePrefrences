  I debated in high school for all four years and college for two at Emory University. I prefer to be told how to evaluate the round. For disads, that means lots of impact analysis. For critical arguments, what does winning your framework do for you in the round? How should I evaluate it against their case impacts. For theory, make sure each argument is impacted, why is clash good or bad for debate?
I also prefer to be told what your evidence says and how to apply it in the round, especially for critical arguments. The more specific you are to the aff, the better. Relying on generic link overviews is a good way to lose.
This seems short, but if you do these two things-- explain your argument and why if I think you win it you should win the debate you'll get my ballot.

For speaker points- take care of your own timing. Be ready to go when you stop prep, and make some jokes. Great topics include college football (everyone hates the Gators), scary teachers, and shameless Emory love.

I'll be happy to answer any questions.
