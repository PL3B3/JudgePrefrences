  Lincoln-Douglas

I am a fairly experienced Lincoln Douglas judge. I understand most philosophies and enjoy debates with philosophical clash. Whoever can uphold their value the most in round is what matters to be. Do this by making a clear link between your value and value-criterion and showing why your side (AFF/NEG) upholds the most important value. Evidence is essential for me. I need to see the philosophical clash, but showing me real-world examples of why your value is better and upheld is important to me. I take a more pragmatic approach to LD debate. 

Policy

I know stock issues and can follow a policy debate, but it is not my specialty. Win the stock issues. I enjoy clash and will enjoy a debate of you focused on the resolution. I don't mind someone running topicality, but there better be a good reason for it.

Speed: I can follow fast speed, but moderate speed is more preferable.

Also, I will never give you less than 25 speaker points, unless you do something down-right rude in round.
