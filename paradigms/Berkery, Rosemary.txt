  Regis High School. Lawyer, parent. I am not impressed by technical jargon, speed or spreading. I look for clearly articulated, well-constructed cases, with well-thought out contentions that are supported by logic, analysis and/or evidence. In short, I want to be impressed by the force of a debater's arguments, not by a debater trying to be cute or clever.
