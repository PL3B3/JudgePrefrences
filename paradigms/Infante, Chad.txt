  Hey, debate is about argumentation and about human interaction, so make sure there is clash and be nice while youâ€™re debating. Do what you like best, if you want to have a T throw down, go ahead, if you want to have a K, DA, CP throw down go ahead; do what makes you happy, just be nice to your partner and the other team.
