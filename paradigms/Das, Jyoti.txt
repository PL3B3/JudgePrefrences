  Parent judge, 3rd year of judging High school PF, LD and some Policy debates including CA state and national competitions. As a student several decades ago enjoyed HS debate myself and now enjoy judging PF and LD. To a great extent I am open-minded and try not bring my own bias to the debate tournament. I prefer to judge LD or PF debates. I prefer analytical arguments and debaters need to convince me using their arguments. I flow and use the framework as debated in the evaluation during rebuttal and cross-X. I consider a value, value criteria, contention, or observation to be "dropped" if it is not addressed in a speech that it should be addressed, and the point will go to the other competitor at that point. I prefer evidence / examples from worthy sources and not obscure websites. I enjoy debates between professional and respectful debaters. I need to understand the debate and cannot handle spreading well â€“ you can speak fast as long as you are clear. Best argument wins.
