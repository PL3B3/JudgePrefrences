  About Me:
Hello! My name is Jessica (Berberich) Skoglund. I graduated from Olathe South High School where I was a debater, and I didn’t debate in college. I’m currently an English teacher and an assistant debate/forensics coach at Olathe Northwest High School in Olathe, KS, and I previously coached for Pittsburg High School in Pittsburg, KS. While I hope that the below paradigm covers most of your questions, please feel free to ask more!

Default Assumptions:
-I will walk into the round as a tabula rasa judge—you get to tell me what to vote for. However, if you don’t do this, I will default to evaluating the round as a policymaker, and I generally prefer to evaluate the round this way.
-The affirmative should advocate something topical, and this position must be clear and stable.
-The negative should prove that the affirmative's advocacy is undesirable, worse than a competitive alternative, or theoretically invalid.

Other Categories: 
Speed: Please slow down for tags/author names and theory—I don’t have a speech doc in front of me.

DAs/Counterplans: Generic arguments are fine, though specific links can often help with probability calculus. I don’t believe I lean Aff or Neg on CP theory arguments.

Kritiks: My threshold is higher than most on Ks. I’m unlikely to vote on Ks that don’t have a clear link/alt, and I don’t typically buy “reject the Aff” as an alt. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t run them and I won’t vote on them—you just need to think through these things first.

Theory: This category is similar to Ks for me: I like a good theory debate, but I would say my threshold for you running theory is higher than average. I need to see actual clash here. Reading your PICs good frontline after they read their PICs bad frontline gives me a debate where I'm unlikely to vote.

Miscellaneous:
-As tab as I can try to be, you being rude, unfair, or otherwise negatively affecting the debate/another team does cloud my judgment of the round. Don’t put me in that position.
-I want to intervene in the round as little as possible. I rarely ask for evidence, and I’d advise you not to rely too much on embedded clash. At the end of the round, you need to advocate your position and tell me specifically why it's preferable to the other team.
