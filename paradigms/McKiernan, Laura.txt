I debated for three years in high school. It has been a long time since I've been in a round, so please go a little slower than usual! I have zero knowledge of the topic or literature, so you might want to spend a bit more time explaining your link stories, ev, etc. In theory, I'll vote for anything, but you'll need to make an exceptionally strong case to win on anything non-traditional (performance, really esoteric kritiks). Give me a framework. I'll be as open as I can.
