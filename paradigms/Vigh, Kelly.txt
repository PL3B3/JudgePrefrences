  I am the mother of a first year debater at Brighton High School. I was Junior and Varsity policy debater at Brighton High School from 1990-1993 .

I prefer a traditional debate and wish for the debaters to speak slowly and clearly. I am open to nearly any type of argument as long as it easily makes sense and contributes positively to the debate round. I will do my best as a judge. I will judge fairly and vote for the side of which I think clearly wins the round.

I enjoy watching and judging debates and think the topics are always interesting. I renewed my interest in the debate community through my daughter and her team.

I am looking forward to judging all debaters and wish you luck throughout your debate career.
