  A careful analysis of benefit/cost of the recommended policy is the basis for evaluation the round. I will evaluate the arguments based on how clear the impacts are weighed, this means that likely outcomes will always trump possible outcomes with near zero probability. Flow need to be deliberate and clear, therefore I prefer few key evidence than long list of evidence delivered incomprehensibly. Respect for opponent and articulate delivery are important and will weigh in my final judgement
