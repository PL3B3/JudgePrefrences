  I have been coaching Policy, LD, and PF for 8 years and have judges at state and national tournaments. I coach and judge all the debate events, but I have judged a lot more Policy than LD. What this means to you is that I can follow speed and logic, but please explain LD jargon to me. I will understand your arguments. 

Speed: Fine, as long as you are understandable. But, I honestly will always vote quality over quantity so I have no preference for fast or a conversational rate.
Drops:  I keep a rigorous flow but I am not super meticulous about dropped points if they don't really matter in the round. If you want me to know they dropped something then tell me and tell me why it impacts the round that your argument still flows through. 
Evidence: I pay attention to the whole card. Make sure your card says what your tagline says. Call someone else on it if their card doesn't say what they think it says.
Unusual Advocacy: I love them! If you can really sell me on something through strong warrants and good internal links then there is a good chance I will vote for it.
Voting Issues: Do them.
