  This is my second year judging LD debates.

I'm a traditional judge. Your job, as a debater, is to persuade me of your side of the resolution. You should be slow, clear, and articulate as this is an activity based in communication. I think value and criterion are important parts of an LD case. If you want to run your cool and edgy stuff I am not the judge you want to have in the back of the room.
