If you are decisively winning. We have all been there, please don't use up all my time. I like when the debate ends earlier. You will get higher speaks.

update 2017-2018
its been awhile since I've judged. almost two years at this point and I don't miss it very much.


things to know about me
- you are better than me at debate. you've been warned. like if I debated one of you with infinite prep time, you'd win. that has been established. this means if I vote against and you argue with me, you will probably win that "post-round" debate, which is awkward for everyone, so please strike me.
- if you are going to spread the other team out of the water, strike me
- if you have a bunch of different impacts that I have to keep track of, strike me
- if you read more than 5 off, strike me

- I don't know the topic like at all. as of today (December 13, 2017) I don't know the topic of any form of debate. I will know it before I enter your round
- please assume I know nothing about your argument. with some judges there is inside context, with me there is none. so please no acronyms, no jargon, no screaming
- I am uncomfortable with speed. when I was a debater speed was really difficult for me. when I say speed I really mean lack of clarity but those two usually go pretty hand and hand. if I can't flow you or write what you say down you will not win. please be clear especially with quick arguments.
-its important to me that the debate remains interesting. this means it is educational and not just a place where two teams speed through a bunch of blocks
- MOST Important: write my ballot. control the framing of the debate. if you do this you will probably win. the team that wins the big picture usually wins for me. this doesn't mean avoid being technical, this just means I want you to put together some narrative.
- I am uncomfortable with hostility. please be funny but don't be mean. greet each other with smiles and hugs and respect. I hate meanness especially when it sounds condescending

Argumentation

- I am probably a lot more comfortable with the critical theory than I am with policy argumentation that this point. I was never good enough at debate to develop what I considered to be my strength of argumentation, but I definitely kept up with criticisms after college for than I did with whatever policy thing you are talking about.
- I am comfortable with performance. in fact if you have new stuff you'd like to try out id love to hear it
- topicality is tough for me to flow but for some reason fw isn't, as well as theory. I'm pretty good at theory Id say
- I am okay with fw, I regretfully went for it. I don't like it but I understand its utility.
- to get good speaks use warranted evidence with strong explanations. deep and detailed, I am a sucker for that
- think of me as a parent judge that understands tech
