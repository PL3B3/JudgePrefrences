  I am parent judge, I have never debated before in my life, but now my daughter is in speech and debate so I judge.

I have only judged traditional LD rounds before and I have never judged progressive. Keep it simple and explain the rules. The more you explain, the better.

Speakers should be organized and provide a road map. I'm old school and I don't like spreading. If you speak so fast that I don't catch your arguments, then it's your bad, not mine. I believe that this activity should teach speaking skills and improve an individual's ability to persuade. I'm open to any argument as long as it is explained clearly. 


Make eye contact. 
Your attitude towards your opponents is a determining factor in the debate. Your behavior is very important.
Dress appropriately and formal.
Confidence is key.
