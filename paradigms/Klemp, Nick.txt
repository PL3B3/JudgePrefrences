General Philosophy: Tabula Rasa. I judge the debate based on the frameworks presented and debated upon in the round, and weigh the critical arguments through the competing frameworks. I will not be doing any of the work for the debaters in the round.

Speed: I am fine with any kind of speed. Happy to say clear if necessary. If I have to say clear more than twice, you're going a lot faster than you actually can, and I'll likely dock speaker points.

Theory: All theory is good with me. Theory that actually matters and checks abuse will have a lot more weight for me than general gamesmanship, but I'm willing to listen to it all. It's your opponents job to let me know if the theory is inconsequential. 

Kritiks: K's are fair game too. Make sure you do the necessary work on linking your opponent into the K. No alternative means the K is a non-issue.

Key Voting Issues/Overviews: Tell me what to vote on. I'd like to know that you think you are winning what I think you are winning. It's very hard for me to vote on an argument you are winning if you don't go for it.
