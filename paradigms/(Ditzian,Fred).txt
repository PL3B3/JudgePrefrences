  My judge philosophy is pretty straightforward I will vote on anything so long as you make sure that I understand it, that it's warranted and that you articulate how it applies to the round/topic.

Speed
I am fine with speed and will yell clear if need be if you don't speak clearly I can't flow what you are saying simple as that

Theory
Theory is just like any other argument it requires that interpretations be warranted, abuse needs to be shown, standards need to be well developed and I need a reason to vote on theory so saying "vote on fairness" or "vote on education" is not enough you need to be showing why those are important.

Kritical Argumentation -e.g. micropolitics, K's, K's of theory, performances ect...-

Refer to the sentence on the top

Evidence 
I will call up evidence if needed 

Anything else can be clarified before the round or email me at: fred_ditzian@knights.ucf.edu
