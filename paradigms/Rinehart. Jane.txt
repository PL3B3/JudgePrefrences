It's really not too complicated. I like to hear a good debate with lots
of warrants behind the arguments. I want the debaters to do the work in the round. Three well articulated arguments are appreciated vs. everything but the kitchen sink.
Believe it, or not, I'm not that big into the kritic world. I'll
listen, but I like things to link, offer a reasonable alternative and be
explained in the round.
I do think that the ballot is important. The message is very clear.
I'm really tired of the rip and read style. While I agree that it does
improve reading skills, and students do like to lord it over one
another, listening to four debaters "suck air" for over an hour has
become painful.
