Speed: Speed is okay. make sure to be clear. 

Value Clash: Value Clash debate is getting less popular, but I still like debates with value clashes, but if there is not a clash dont force one. Instead, weigh your impacts over your opponent's.

Counter plans: I will consider almost any counter plan. Make sure there is net benefit in the C/P. C/P should be clear and well explained.
