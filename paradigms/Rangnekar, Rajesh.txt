  I am a parent judge and have enjoyed judging many LD debates. I appreciate structure and clarity in presenting the contentions and look for logical arguments supported by evidence where possible. I do not follow spreading which may lead to a disadvantage in my allocation of speaker points and assessment of overall performance. I appreciate engaging debates that are done in a mutually respectful manner and without exaggeration. Feel free to ask me questions at the time of the debate.
