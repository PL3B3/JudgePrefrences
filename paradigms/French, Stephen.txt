Although not a debate coach, I have become extremely familiar with the art and style of debate. I have judged enough tournaments to know when you are being abusive, and I will call you out on it. 

I do have a strong theatre background, so I expect you to present your argument in a clear and logical manner. Speak so that you can be understood and do not run into your opponent's time.

I am open to any arguments as long as your present the facts, and you actually know what you are talking about.

Speed: When in doubt, slow down. I know speed is part of debate; however, I think it is important to actually understand what you are saying. If I canâ€™t understand you, I will tell you to slow down. If I have to tell you twice, I will deduct points. Remember, your judge is normally the ONLY person in the room NOT looking at your case.Try not to mumble or use verbal stalls. I want to actually understand what you are saying. I am actually going to flow the debate.
