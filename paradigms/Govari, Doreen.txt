USC 2015 UPDATE:
1. Please don't suck up to me before the round.
2. I'm probably not the best judge for a K debate.
3. I will gut check if I cannot understand you - speed is fine, but be human.

I debated for three years on the circuit at Torrey Pines, graduating in 2013. Speed is fine,
but please be clear and loud; it’s also been a few months since I
flowed anything. Slow down on author names and tag lines.

I don’t have a lot of rigid opinions about debate, and I’ll evaluate any argument as long
as it’s not blatantly offensive and has a clear warrant. I first decide who’s winning a
framework and then whoever has more (or better) offense to that framework.

I enjoy theory and T, and engaged in many such debates in high school, but I’d rather see
strategic and nuanced shells than A-Spec or plans bad every round. However, I’m more
likely to be familiar with the theory arguments you read than the topic literature, so feel
free to run them. I default no RVIs, drop the debater, and competing interpretations, but
I’m open to any other paradigms. Please weigh strength of link to different standards, and
between the standards, to make theory debaters easier to resolve.

As a debater, I mostly read philosophical top-heavy ACs, but I have no problem with
other styles of debating, like more policy-style rounds. I also don’t have issues with
critical arguments, but I do not have much familiarity with the literature, so please
explain your arguments effectively the first time around and make sure you have a
justified framework/role of the ballot for framing impacts to the K.

I’ll try to average around a 28 in terms of speaker points. Higher points for better strategy
and clarity. Don’t lie or be rude.

Good luck and have fun!
