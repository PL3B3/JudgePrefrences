  I am the coach of Nashua High North. This will be my second year judging policy debate. I have judged about 15 rounds on the topic. Spreading must be very clear, and can't be too fast, or else I will be unable to flow. Kritiks are not my favorite, but if they are logical I will consider them. I always consider the ethics/morality of what you are aruging for. All other policy arguments are fine, they just need to be explained well.
