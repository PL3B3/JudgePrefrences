I have experience in several IE's and debating events as both a debater and judge and am active in the collegiate debate circuit. I'm comfortable judging just about anything but I probably do have some LD prejudices so just something to consider!

Debate- I'll take any argument you throw out as long as you prove it. Just about anything's fair game as long as you are respectful of your opponent(s). I don't like voting on technicalities or just counting obscure dropped arguments, so prove your case well and focus on the big picture. Also, don't expect me to simply infer an argument. If you have a point to make, just take 10 seconds to say it. Nothing's too absurd or silly for me to write off without a reason! I'm cool with speed, although I very much prefer a more oratorical style if at all possible. I tend to be pretty generous with speaker points as long as you act in a professional manner and act in a generally respectful manner. I know you're debating, but it's possible to do so respectfully!

IE- It's hard to really describe this since the events are so different but I just want speakers to perform their events well. If you're in HI, don't be afraid to go crazy and make me laugh. DI, definitely don't do that! In general just be sure to live up to the expectations your event may contain!
