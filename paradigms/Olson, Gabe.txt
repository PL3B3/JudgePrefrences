  I debated throughout high school but have been out of the game since 2008. I am cool with any argument as long as you are providing warranted arguments, and tell me how I should evaluate them within the framework of the specific debate round.

I will pull the trigger on any argument, but if you are going to go for theory or topicality I am a firm believer that the whole 2NR, or atleast the majority of it, must be focused on that argument.
