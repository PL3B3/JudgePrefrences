  Background: I did Lincoln Douglas debate for two years in high school, and helped with the team I assistant coached for the past two in Lincoln Douglas as well. I qualified for the TOC in LD my sophomore season in high school, and led the team I coached to LD Sweeps in a few tournaments. I also did PF, Policy, Congress, and countless IE's.

Paradigm: I am usually a pretty standard judge. Speed is not an issue for me at any point, as long as I can understand what you are saying. I am also a tabula rasa judge, so in your final speech (somewhere), you should tell me why you as the affirmative or the negative, wins the round. I want you to tell me where you are going on the flow, so I am not lost looking for everything as well.

Debate: Any style of debate is okay with me except very few arguments that are set to demean your opponent or their case thereof. I will assign 0 speaker points if any of these attacks are made, even if they are made in joking fashions or very minimal. Debate should be a fun event, one in which, nobody should feel inferior. Treat your opponent with respect.

Ballots: Usually my ballots contain a large sum of comments for which you may improve yourself as a speaker. So heads up when you see a lot written in. Also, I have only given one 30 in speaker points, so I am very hard to dazzle. I have given lots of 29s and 28s though. So just a warning.
