  Hello and good luck. First I would like to say that I really enjoy judging LD and have been coaching and judging for the past 14 years.
Let's start with the progressive style movement in LD. I am not a fan of spreading in LD. I do not mind a quick pace as long as you speak clear and annunciate. I do not like disads, theory shells, nor counterplans. I like a good old fashion value debate. I like observations, Standards, and contentions. I want numbers and sub points where needed. I expect direct clash case to case. I enjoy voting issues. Typically I will base my decisions on whose case upholds the winning value in the round. I like empirical evidence as well as logic. I look for courtesy throughout the round. Let me know if you have anymore questions.
Thanks
