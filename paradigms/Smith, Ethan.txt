TL;DR- weigh your args, explain your warrants 

Experience:
Debated PF at Logan High School 2012-2016
Qualified and competed at Nationals, 2015 and 2016
some LD experience

Framework

I'll be evaluating the round based off of the winning framework. If there's competition between the two please tell me why I should prefer yours. Generally if your framework is advantageous to your case (and it should be) and you win the framework debate with impacts left on your side, you'll probably win. This is giving me some sort of mechanism in which to weigh your args. For example, how do I compare impacts to the environment to impacts to the economy, etc. In your last speech, weigh the args on both sides and tell me why you win. I really enjoy frameworks based on some sort of philosophy, such as function/duties of a state (Rawls, etc.)

Cross x
-Be respectful (obviously). I won't be flowing cross. If there's something in there that you want me to pay attention to, bring it up in your next speech. I feel like that's pretty standard practice

Speaking
Speed: 7/10
-Many judges are against speed in PF. I'm not one of them. The most important thing though if you're going fast is to be clear and tell me where you are. I'll say "clear" twice and if you still don't make sense I probably won't be listening, and that could be bad for you. As well, slow down a bit in the early morning and late at night (probably don't have to push that too hard)
-Speaking pretty is always a nice thing to do regardless of what event you're in, and will get you good speaks. If it's between speaking and quality of arguments, I'll vote on args. However, speaking ability and argument quality are often correlated
-applies to ld too, read tags slowly

Evidence
-I'll call for evidence I believe to be important to the round, or if I'm confused as to how two pieces of ev weigh against each other. If you tell me to call for a card in round, I'll do it.

Speaker Points
-Said before, speaking pretty and good args/logic/implementation of said args will get you good speaks. It takes a very good round to get a 30. Generally, good debaters will receive a 28

Plans, topicality, theory, k's
So my main style in high school was dressing up K's for PF (blasphemy, I know). Debate should be what you want it to be. I'm not a PF purist, if you want to throw imperialism or biopower at me, that's totally fine. I haven't heard all the really abstract k's, be able to explain them well. be very clear on your alternatives. It's hard to have a really good 20 second shell. I'm more likely to vote for well-developed args
-tell me exactly how you want the round broken down, i.e. what to evaluate first

Other things
-Dress however you want
-Be respectful of lower level debaters, make the round a learning experience

Likes
-humor/pop culture references (puns especially)- others are Star Wars, popular songs, science jokes
-signposting
-weighing (super important)
-strong FW
-warrants
-prerequisite args
-sass

Dislikes (might lose the round)
-racism
-sexism
-ad hominem attacks

If you're confused about my RFD feel free to come and ask me questions after the round. If you have any questions about my paradigm, you may email me before round

I love debate, and I'll do my best to help you to love it as well!
