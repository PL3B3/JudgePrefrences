School Affiliation: Lynbrook (Hired)

I currently debate on the collegiate parliamentary debate circuit for the University of the Pacific (NPDA). I also compete in NFA LD, which is evidence based. I have never competed at the high school level. However, I have judged for at least 5-7 high school tournaments in the past.
I have three years experience with college parli and two years of experience with college NFA LD. I have judged high school CX, LD, Public forum and congress. I have not yet judged this year on the high school topic.

I consider myself to be a much more technical debater and love organization and well structured arguments. Speed is not an issue for me, go at whatever speed you like as long as you are clear.

There is no position I will not vote on. I try to judge solely based on the arguments made in the round and as a result have voted many times against my own political beliefs and knowledge of the subject.

Topicality: I will admit that I am strange and thoroughly intrigued by really good T debate. I am also turned off by really bad T debate. Use this information wisely.
Kritiks: I think critiques need a viable alternative or can be easily taken out by the aff.
Counterplan: Whatever you tell me. I am familiar with the vast majority of CP theory. Like I said, I vote off the arguments made in the round.

I vote on the flow. Explain to me how/why you outweigh.
