  Hello, I am Jamie Tran. Undergraduate student working as assistant policy coach for George Washington HS in Denver. 4 years of local policy debate in high school, 1 year of parli at CU Boulder. 

Tab judge. I flow every speech but not the cross-examinations and vote on the flow. Debaters are encouraged to tell me where to vote and what the role of the ballot should be. Debate should be fun, so have fun. Don't be mean.

Help me with my flow. Overviews make me very happy. Take 20 seconds to explain what your case/argument is and why you win it (impact calc, dropped args, etc.) in a way that someone's grandma can understand it and you'll be fine.

Specifics:

T: I'd rather hear one or two good T than five of them for the sake of time skew.

Theory: I have a higher threshold for theory. If you don't go for only theory I'm not likely to vote on it. Terminal impacts are key here.

K: I am familiar with most K lit. Overviews are especially nice on the K debate. If you are very organized with the flow (almost as if you have separate K, Link, Alt, Implication flows) you are more likely to win. I have a love/hate relationship with framework.

CP: CP should have text. I don't like Consult counterplans. I don't like dispositionality.

DA: Do overviews. Do impact calculus. I'm fine with non-terminal impacts if you warrant why I should prefer them over terminal impacts.
