  Background: I debated LD at Walton High School for 3 years. Currently, I'm a junior at Emory University majoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. I judged some debates a couple of years ago, but this is my first tournament in at least a year.

I don't have a ton of policy experience, but I understand the debate. Speed is ok if I can understand you. No jargon, I won't understand it.

Clear language usually expresses a clear thought.

Go big picture in the 2N.

I've read Hegel, Deleuze, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Kant, Aristotle, and the classics. I haven't read books about critical race.

Decision comes from the strength of arguments on the flow, not them number of cards or contentions. Beware the fallacy of plurality!

I set aside most of my personal beliefs in the round.

Just convince me.
