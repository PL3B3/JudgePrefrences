  While I am thoroughly amused that I had a fake wikispace (I mean really) I was not on here for a reason. I would rather judge no rounds than have people pref me because i was a K debater 4 years ago and that somehow means I will be more receptive to certain teams/args. That being said it really shouldn't matter what preferences I have if you win the round.
