  I am James Callison's father. James debates for Kent Denver. I am NOT a circuit judge; I do have experience judging local and lay rounds. You probably should not run off cases in front of me. I am a lawyer, so I like a bit of presentation (I will still vote for the winner of the debate, but persuasiveness is always nice). I am not good with speed. I do, however, love philosophy, so if you make it a good philosophical debate, then you are what is right with America. Have fun. Relax. Give it your all.
