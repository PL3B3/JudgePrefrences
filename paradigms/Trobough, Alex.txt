  Hey!

I'm Alex, I used to debate for Sumner Academy in Kansas. I did a fair amount of national circuit CX and LD in high school, I know some things about both. I'll try to make this as simple as possible, above all else, run what you want to run and have fun with it. Don't alter any part of your strategy to fit my liking. 

1. Do you, but don't be offensive. I'm fine with just about any argument as long as it isn't discriminatory or offensive. I mostly debated without a plan text, rarely (if ever) was topical, went one off every round, and almost always had a performance affirmative. Knowing all of that should not alter what you argue. 

2. Do some impact framing. I tend to get to the end of a lot of rounds these days and realize that nobody told me why I should care about the arguments they "won." Try to avoid that. I hate having to sign a ballot to a team that I think probably did the poorer job debating but also did some impact weighing when the other team did not.

3. Framework/Topicality/Theory. If you want me to vote on these arguments you need to do some serious work on them. I love a good framework or topicality debate. I do not have default on framework, regardless of my background. However, that doesn't mean I will vote for you just because the other team seems untopical, I need a reason why that is important and that needs to be the winning argument. I enjoy some theory debates, but only those that clearly explain why I should care and why I should care enough to outweigh the other team's arguments.

4. Spreading is fine, but don't start off at 600 wpm. Slow down for author names, slow down for tags, slow down for perms, slow down for texts. 

Some of this is lifted from Mylan Gray and Sunhee Simon's paradigms (the homies). If you'd like to anything else about my views on debate check either of their philosophies out and hopefully that will answer any questions.
