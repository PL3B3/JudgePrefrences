  I am a parent judge with four years experience judging LD. I prefer a traditional case structure and a slow to moderate delivery speed. Framework is very important and contentions should be well supported with data and philosophy. I do not generally accept theory, but sometimes it is essential as a defensive tool. If you offer a theory argument, it better be for an egregious act by your opponent. If I don’t agree, it won’t take much for your opponent to refute and return to the debate. Don’t stray too far from the resolution debate. I don’t want to hear that the resolution is biased. No plans or counter plans, kritiks or other tech stuff. Also, don’t employ cards that you don’t understand because you got them from a successful opponent. You can quote anyone from Hitler to Jesus, but your opinion counts the least. Your logic will be valued.
The purpose of LD is to have a debate on the moral and ethical issues presented in the resolution.
