  I am a blank slate. You need to tell me how to vote and why. I am a Tabs Judge but it's not always all about the one small dropped arguement if there are high impacts and good voters in the round. Don't be afraid to lump and dump. Be careful not to live in your own philosophical world. You need to have good clash and argumentation. Have fun and be polite.
