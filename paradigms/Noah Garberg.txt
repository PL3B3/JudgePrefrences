  So this paradigm is for Big Lex/Emory, but I can't imagine it'll change much in the future.
I debated 4 years of LD at Lexington High School, and I went to like one policy tournament in college. I'm currently a freshman at Emory, double majoring in philosophy and psychology.
There's like a ton of things I could say here, but I'll keep it concise:
--I like framework debates a lot, I think I'm much better at evaluating those debates than others. 

--I read the exact same Kant framework on both sides in every debate my senior year. I'd say I'm really familiar with and like Kant. 

--I'll be much more interested in your debate if you read some pomo or high theory shit I think that stuff is really interesting. Explain it though, I don't know deleuze that well, i know Baudrillard and Foucault pretty well. 

--I'm fine with tricks, but I'm pretty trash at flowing, so like make sure I catch it. 

--I don't like Anthro good arguments. 

--I haven't thought about Theory or T in a year.
I'll genuinely vote off any argument if you win it. I used to get anxious when I saw a judge's paradigm was completely different than the prep I had, so you're fine reading LARP or Ks or whatever. That being said I'd rather judge a framework debate.
