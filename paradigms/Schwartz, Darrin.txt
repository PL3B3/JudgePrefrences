  I recently had the opportunity to judge public forum debates and extemporaneous speeches during several local competitions. Although this is my first time judging Lincoln-Douglas debates, I feel it is important to pay close attention to which side is advancing the most significant arguments in the round. I am looking for participants to select, compare, and prioritize values within their given topic. I will also look for well-developed arguments (depth over breadth). Participants should simply speak clearly and argue logically; most importantly, link arguments.
