I debated CX for three years in high school (1987-1990) for Westfield HS (Houston, Texas) and 1.5 years in College at US Air Force Academy.

I judge high school varsity LD or CX, at most, about once a month during the season.

Summary:
Demonstrate your command of the topic and arguments. If you don’t have evidence, don’t be afraid to use your critical thinking skills – I will consider thoughtful analysis as well as evidence. I do expect LD rounds to be less about speed (you can always select CX if you’d like), but regardless, never exceed your own speed limit when speaking. I’m pretty good with speed and flowing though not as adept as I was when I was younger. I will certainly vote on dropped arguments and if both teams agree then I won’t interfere. If forced to weigh between two options, I’ll do my best based on what was said in the round.

Details:
I value strategy, clash and in-depth analysis. Clean line-by-line is great. Make sure you speak slightly slower on analytics or when making a key point.

T/KT – I’m very familiar with topicality argumentation and far less familiar with kritik T, but I’m open to any argument that is explained well.

DA/CP/PIC – This is all good. Don’t forget good old fashion thinking and logic. I’m open to PICs.

Kritiks – I’m less familiar with K. If you must bake with a cookie cutter K then case specific links and analysis are required ingredients.
