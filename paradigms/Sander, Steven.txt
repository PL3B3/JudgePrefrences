School Strikes: Polytechnic, Oakwood Secondary School


I debated policy for four years at Polytechnic. Some college policy and parli experience. In 2013, I was the policy coach for Oakwood Secondary School.

I don't appreciate uncivil behavior and your speaker points will be severely impacted. Prep time stops when the flash drive is ejected from the computer. I hate when people can't do this in a timely fashion.

T: I like case lists and topical versions of the aff (or reasons why the aff should be neg CP ground). Don't expect me to do the work for you on internal links between standards and voters.
K: I ran the K a lot but don't expect me to know your argument. Contextualization is vital.
CP: Not a huge fan of consult CPs.
DA: I mostly evaluate the DA using an offense-defense paradigm.
Performance: I'm not predisposed to voting for or against performance arguments. Please do a good job contextualizing your "role of the ballot" arguments.

If you have any specific questions, please ask before the round begins.
