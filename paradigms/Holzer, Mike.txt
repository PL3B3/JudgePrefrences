  My name is Mike Holzer, I debated 4 years for Lake Highland Prep in Orlando, FL, on both local and national levels. I currently attend the University of Central Florida where I study English.

From a style standpoint, I have no problems flowing or comprehending speed, however, often times when I say that it leads to going 600 MPH for no real reason. So essentially speed for the sake of speed I can't handle. Additionally, and this probably sounds dumb to say, but a level of respect amongst the competitors is something I appreciate. You don't have to put everyone you debate on your Christmas card list, but you don't have to be a jackass either.

From an actual debate standpoint, I evaluate the rounds generally off the standards debate (if either of the competitors wants me to evaluate something before the standards I will, but it's not something I will pull the trigger on right away). In terms of the round, I like to keep myself out of the round and let the competitors provide a basic blueprint of how to evaluate the round. I understand most LD issues are meant to evoke opinions but I don't like to have those going into the round, otherwise there wouldn't be the need for the round in the first place.

Ultimately, I feel like I'm a fairly tab judge, which isn't to say I'm a fan of completely uninteresting debate, but at the same time, just pointing out abuse and throwing out theory ultimately becomes how I feel about speed: Don't just say things for the sake of saying them.
