  Affiliation: MIT

Experience: 4 years of policy debate in high school at Hathaway Brown, mostly on the state level, but also some national tournaments (UMich, GBX, Ohio Valley, Nats); some parliamentary debate experience in college

Paradigm: policymaker in general, but I can be convinced to vote in a different paradigm on a round-to-round basis

Speed: I'm fine with speed, but definitely slow down on standards/theory debates, plan/CP texts, and K tags.

T: I don't mind voting on T, but I have a high-ish standard for voting neg on T, so if you're going to go for it, you're going to have to spend a substantial amount of time on it before the 2NR to get me to vote on it. Reverse-voting issues are silly.

CP: Love them, go for it. Not a fan of new 2NC CP's unless it's in response to a 2AC add-on.

DA: Again, love them, go for it. I think there's almost always going to be some risk of a link, so make sure you do the impact analysis and compare things like high magnitude low probability vs. low magnitude high probability, etc. (Impact calc and overviews were the reasons I did debate.)

K: I like K's, but if you're going for it, don't rely on buzz phrases like "value to life" - explain what that means in the context of the round, give examples. I'm not too familiar with a lot a K's, so just make sure they're well-explained, and I'd be willing to vote on it. Keep in mind that while I enjoy the philosophy behind K's, I'm still a policymaker.

Theory: It's fine, but I have a high threshold for voting aff on condo. Getting me to vote on theory means really delving past the tag lines of the standards and tying them in specifically to the round.

Performance affs and the like: not a fan.

Other stuff:
- Unless there's specific debate about the warrants/credentials of a card, I'm not going to read ev after the round
- I'm not going to vote on drops just because they're pointed out - take the time to tell me why they matter
- Pet peeve: losing rounds due to not kicking out of args properly
- Tag-team is fine as long as the partners don't dominate
- Feel free to ask me questions before the round
