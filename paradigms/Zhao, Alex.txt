  I debated LD for 4 years at Randolph High School in Randolph, NJ. I debated exclusively in the northeast, so if your style is of that area you should be fine. If you're not from there, then your style will also be fine, but I'm less experienced with theory and off cases than I should be. I will vote off of everything, though.

In general, if you can make it easy for me to vote for you, clear, weigh, impact and clash you're good.

If you can't do that then make it clear for me, weigh, impact and clash.

If you can't do that then weigh, impact and clash.

If you can't do even that then just impact and clash.

But please at the very least clash.
