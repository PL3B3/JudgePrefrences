- Fine with speed, theory, most arguments if you explain them. I like explanations of the implications of an argument, whether it is topicality or a kritik, and do not enjoy or reward shallow jargon.
- I've been out of debate for 4 years though and am not necessarily an expert on the topic/familiar with popular arguments
- Feel free to ask if you have specific questions about my judging philosophy.
