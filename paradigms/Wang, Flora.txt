 I debated Lincoln Douglas for three years at Lexington High School and now debate American Parliamentary at Brandeis University. 

I generally defer to the teachings and philosophies of Sara Sanchez and Chris Palmer but below are my judge philosophies.

I believe in general that the better debating is done by the more persuasive and well- warranted debater. With that, debaters should be able to best explain and understand the evidence they present and should properly frame the round. With impact calculus and direct weighing, debaters should be able to effectively write the ballot for the judge. 

Debaters should speak at whatever speed they are comfortable with it. It is better to speak slower with better word economy rather than going as fast as possible. I will not hesitate to tell debaters to slow down if unclear. Debaters should sign post as clearly as possible. 

I start speaker points around 27. If the debate speaks incoherently or drops arguments across the flow, speaker points decrease by .5 for each instance. For a debater to earn a 28 they must be clearly winning the round across the flow. For above a 28, I believe they should be able to break and reach out rounds of a tournament. 29.5 and 30 are rare and will only be a result of an amazing life-changing speech.

Overall, be nice in rounds- itâ€™s never pleasant to watch two high school students yell at you in a closed room. If you have questions please ask before the round and good luck!
