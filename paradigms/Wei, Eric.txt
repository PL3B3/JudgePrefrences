  I'm going to keep this short, but ask me questions before the round and I'll be happy to clarify anything that's not mentioned here. I prefer well warranted, properly impacted stock cases. This isn't because I think there's any virtue to running common arguments, but because they tend to be better argued and supported. If you can run an interesting position that's also reasonably argued, go for it. Give me a clear decision calculus, whether it's a VP/VC or something else. Speak at a reasonable pace, don't use theory unless it's really necessary, and be sure to crystallize at the end of the round so that you write the ballot for me.
