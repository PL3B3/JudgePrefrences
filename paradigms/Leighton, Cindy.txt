  I am a very experienced community judge. I debated in high school eons ago, but not in college. I have raised two daughters who debated throughout high school at Shawnee Mission East and one went on to do mock trial in college. I have judged debate for the last ten years, both for my daughters' school and for the high school where I teach (I teach IB Social and Cultural Anthropology, US History, and Spanish III). I judge most weekends throughout the entire debate season.

I do flow. I can understand speed. Road maps are lovely. I am okay with Kritiks though I don't love them. I rarely vote on topicality but if you can argue it well go for it.
