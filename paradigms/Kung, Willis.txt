  I am a first year judge, and I am very excited to hear all of you debate. I will vote for the debater who I think presents the most persuasive and cohesive case. I will do my best to keep any personal bias out of the rounds and my judging. 

Speed: I prefer to be able to hear and understand your arguments, so no spreading.

Organization: Good organization helps me significantly in understanding and keeping track

Evidence: I look for good, supportive evidence and examples. 

Arguments: Well developed arguments that have clearly explained claims, warrants, and impacts

Rudeness: I dislike excessive aggression or rudeness in rounds 

I believe that everyone should have fun and do their best, and I will give my vote to the person who can convince me why they should win.
