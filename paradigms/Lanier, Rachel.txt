  I debated for Northland Christian School in LD!

Here are my judging preferences:
- Don't spread just to spread.. Spread to make well-developed arguments. If if the arguments are blippy, I won't vote for them. Otherwise speed is fine, just be clear.

- Don't be rude! Being respectful is just so much more pleasant.

- I will vote off theory if you actually give me a valid reason. Don't run theory just to waste time!

- I'm okay with any type of argument, but if you don't extend the WARRANT for why something is true, then I will not vote off the argument.

- Ultimately, I make my decision by voting for whoever is winning some type of standard and linking back arguments to that standard (pretty straight forward).
