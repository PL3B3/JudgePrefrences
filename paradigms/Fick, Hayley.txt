  For both CX and LD I am open to pretty much any kind of argument. That being said, it is your job to give me a framework and voters to use to evaluate the round. Is this going to be a policy round with an impact calculus or is this going to be a critical round with a moral obligation? You tell me.

I'm fine with speed in both CX and LD.

Open CX is great, but every debater should give their own speech. I will not tolerate you interrupting/helping out/speaking for your partner during their speech.

Be respectful!! Being rude or disrespectful to me, your partner, or your opponents is unnecessary and a waste of everyone's time.
