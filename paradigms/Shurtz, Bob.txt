  I have been coaching Lincoln Douglas debate at Hawken School for 25 years. I have been judging for the same length of time. I've judged LD at quite a few national circuit tournaments over the years.

I am open to some theory arguments. I'll listen to topicality arguments when there is a good reason to run them. I'll certainly listen to burdens analysis and I'll try to judge by a decision calculus justified in-round. But, I do want both debaters to debate the resolution. I don't want Kritiks (in LD debate) or narratives. Value and value criterion are mandatory.

Moderately fast speed is fine - especially when reading evidence. However, slow down on tag lines and slow down and enunciate author's names for cards. Debate jargon is fine. I'd rather hear a couple of well developed responses than 7 blip responses. I keep a detailed flow. Be sure to signpost. Weighing arguments is very important. Explain what your decision calculus is and why it is superior to your opponents' and how you win under it (or why you win under both.)
