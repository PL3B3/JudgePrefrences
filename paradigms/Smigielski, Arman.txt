  I'm a senior who does parlimentary debate at tufts. A few notes on my judging paradigm:

I find it hard to write arguments down that are spoken too quickly. Please err on the side of being slower.
Please impact your points well, especially in the rebuttal rounds, and weigh them against the impacts of the other team to illustrate why your side wins.
Be charitable when discussing your opponent's arguments. Don't blip a response that I can't hear or doesn't make that much sense, or that is one of five, as I will judge it on its effectiveness, not whether you said it and then the opponent ignored it.
