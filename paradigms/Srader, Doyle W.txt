You, and your arguing

Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations
Its divisions and precisions,
-T. S. Eliot, Rhapsody On A Windy Night

And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression … dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
- T.S. Eliot, Portrait of a Lady

HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said.
Others can pick and choose if you can't.
- T.S. Eliot, The Waste Land

Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rat's feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
- T.S. Eliot, The Hollow Men

Me, and my deciding

HERE I am, an old man in a dry month,
Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.
- T.S. Eliot, Gerontion

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.
Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.
-T. S. Eliot, Preludes

Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”-
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
Should say: “That is not what I meant at all.
That is not it, at all.”
- T.S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.
-T. S. Eliot, Mr. Apollinax

This, and the difference it makes

I saw the ’potamus take wing
Ascending from the damp savannas,
And quiring angels round him sing
The praise of God, in loud hosannas.
-T. S. Eliot, The Hippopotamus
