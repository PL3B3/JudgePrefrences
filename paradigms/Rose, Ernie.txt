I debated LD in Iowa and on the national circuit, graduating in 2005. I coached at WDM Valley and University School (FL) until 2012. I am now an attorney and judge ld and policy occasionally. I do not have strong preferences regarding the stylistic or argumentative choices that debaters make and find that I enjoy debates more when debaters do what they do best. I would bring your speed down a notch as I judge fewer than 20 debates a year.
