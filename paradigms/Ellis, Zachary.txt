Debating Experience: I am the Vice President of Finance of TCNJ's Society for Parliamentary Debate. I have been competing on the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) circuit for the past three years. I also competed at Chennai Worlds 2014.

General Philosophy: I will not inject my personal opinions into the round. I will accept any argument that is clearly stated, well-substantiated, and directly connected to the overall framework of your case. Please don't spread. I cannot give any credit to arguments that I cannot understand. The debate formats that I participate in are conducive to providing rigorous analysis of a few arguments. Make sure that all of your arguments are well-substantiated. I cannot stress this enough. It's not enough to simply assert things. Also, don't get too caught up in debate lingo (e.g., "cards'). If you use quotes or statistics, you need to link them back to the overall framework of your case.

Rebuttals: When giving a rebuttal speech, I don't want to hear another constructive speech. In other words, I don't want you to simply restate all of the arguments that you have already made. Instead, I want you to boil the round down to two or three major voting issues. I usually weight the rebuttal speeches very heavily in my final decision.
