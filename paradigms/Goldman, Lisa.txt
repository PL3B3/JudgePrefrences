  I appreciate any argument type so long as it is logically argued and well supported. Any case that is well articulated and defended will fly with me.

Impacts are essential, and warrants must be supported and incorporated into the overall debate. I generally prefer to judge based on overall coherence and power of argument/s, rather than on technicalities and small drops, and I am essentially listening for why the points discussed should matter within the framework of the debate.

I prefer moderate speed (coherence and clarity are important to me), though I can handle higher speeds with roadmaps if necessary.
