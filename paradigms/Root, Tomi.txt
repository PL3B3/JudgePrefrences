  My debate background consists of PF and CX. 
I am not a very picky judge, debate well, explain your points and your arguments, have good defense and offense and you should be fine. Since I prefer judging PF most of my opinions are based around that. I don't like spreading and it can influence my vote, if I can't hear your argument because you're talking too fast then I can't flow it and if the round comes down to that I have to go by what is on my flow. Please don't be rude in round, I understand cross can get heated at times and that is fine but there is a line and it shouldn't be crossed. There really isn't a whole lot following that, I don't like to restrict arguments or styles because I know it can be difficult to prep for every judges preferences.
