  I debated two years at Decatur High school and 1 year at UNT

First, i really dont care what you do, debate how you want to, just make coherent arguments

Framework- its fine, probably need to go a bit slower on analytics/not carded args if you want me to get everything, need impacts and internals clearly explained, etc

T- almost same as above, default to competing interp, if you want to go for this you need to spend some time here, no problem voting on T

Theory- both sides should be reading theory, same as above, slow down on analytics, give me clear explanation of internals and impacts, but rej the arg gets you out of almost any theory debate

K- love the K, i primarily go for these type of arguments when i personally debate, but my bias to these arguments means if you cant explain it clearly or correctly itll be hard to win, biggest arg for the aff/neg needs to answer for me is case outweighs, spend a lot of time contextualizing your impact claims against the policy ones

DA- they're fine

CP- same as above
