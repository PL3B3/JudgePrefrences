  As a former PF debater, I am used to different variations in speaking and argumentation. I am a fast speaker myself, so I don't mind if you speak a little fast, just be courteous to the other debaters in the room. Also, please don't spread, its just confusing for everyone. Finally, make cross-fire pleasant; it's not a yelling match or competition as to who can get the most words in, or who can shout louder over the other person. Other than that, have a fun time, and feel free to ask me any other questions you may have.
