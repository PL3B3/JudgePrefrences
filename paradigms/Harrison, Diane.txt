  Background: I am normally a speech and interpretation judge, I like to be entertained!

Theory: Not a fan.

Criteria/Standards: I see this as the utmost important part of the debate. You need to clearly display how your case impacts your standard/criteria, and if you can, how you can also link into your opponent's! Make sure the link from your contention level arguments is CLEAR so that I can put that directly onto my flow. If you don't do this, I will need to make assumptions about what you're saying...and this is not okay.

Speed: This is a public speaking event-- I don't understand why debaters feel the need to cram as much "stuff" into their arguments. I don't see this as necessary and speaking too quickly can be a detriment. I'm an educated woman, and I can follow pretty much anything at any speed. But, when you're trying to argue complex philosophies at 400 words per minute, your argument loses effectiveness because you're not allowing time for my brain to digest this information. I'll say clear once as a warning to slow down. If I have to ask again, your speaker points will be deducted.

If I post this information, or if debaters ask specific questions about what my preferences are, I assume you ask because you care and because you'll modify your argument. Please...again I state that this is a public speaking event so make sure you consider your audience before you debate.

WHAT I LIKE:

-CLEAR signposting. SLOW DOWN for author names and taglines.

-Not too fast pace

-Intelligent, thoughtful arguments. Don't be offensive to your opponent. This is debate, and kids should feel safe.

-Weighing analysis. I love this. You can't have too much of it.

-Crystallization - this will be key in whether I vote for you.


WHAT I DON'T LIKE:

-Fast, incoherent speeches

-Rudeness

-Debaters who get mad because I didn't understand their arguments. It's your job to be as clear as possible. Educate me!


I don't disclose. Good luck!
