  I debated in high school for Eagan High School, and I am on the MSU debate team.


I don't have a lot of preferences for debate, but there are a few things you should know:

- I have not judged very many rounds on this topic (about 3), so keep in mind that I do not know the intricacies of space exploration and development.

- My debate background is fairly straight up policy, so I don't have a ton of experience with the K. If you go for the politics disad well, it will be more advantageous to you than if you go for the K amazingly.

Other than that, I am pretty much open to anything.
