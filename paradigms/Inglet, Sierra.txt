Outside of sexist, racist, homophobic, or any other type of offensive arguments any argument you want to run is fine by me.

*NOTE ON THEORY* I like theory. I will vote on theory. That being said I have a higher threshold on theory than other arguments. I evaluate theory as an "innocent until proven guilty" type issue, meaning even if your opponent cold concedes your theory shell, unless you prove to me/give me reasons why they have been abusive and caused harm in the round I will not vote for you on theory. I default no RVIs, I do not believe theory is inherently abusive, this does not mean I do not think abusive theory exists. All this means is to win an RVI in front of me don't tell me why theory is inherently bad tell me why your opponent's theory was abusive and bad.

Miscellaneous Opinion Things:
- My default for Theory and Topicality is competing interps.
- I don't think white people should run Wilderson.

DO:
- Have clash
- Impact theory
- Impact everything
- Weigh everything

Whoever does the most comparative analysis is probably going to win.

DON'T:
- Use gendered language
- Be a butthead
- Be sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. etc.

BONUS POINTS:
- Sass
- Weird (justified) arguments
- Args you genuinely care about/believe in.
- Puns
