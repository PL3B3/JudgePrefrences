  Paradigm:
I consider myself a policy judge, mainly deciding on the impacts that are presented in the round. This said, I will vote on topicality if the debater can present a compelling enough argument. I'm okay with speed, but would prefer that the tags of cards and read at a normal pace and the advantages,impacts etc... of an argument are signposted clearly, if I can't understand you, I won't be able to judge the debate. I will accept a K in the round but would prefer that the debate stays on the current resolution, not theory. Like I said before I prefer to vote on impacts.
