  I am an English and creative writing teacher and have judged speech events in the past. 

I will be following the standard format for judging LD events. Cases should have a framework and debaters will not be judged on presentation but rather content and it is up to you to present your argument clearly.

I will not read full cases but am open to checking cards if needed.
