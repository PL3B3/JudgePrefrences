Beacon High School, NY

Background:

I debated all four years of high school from 1999 - 2003. I have done some judging since then, and for the past two years have served as an advisor for the Beacon team. As a former debater I understand the different types of arguments and I'm generally open to all of them (K, T,CP, DA etc). I am generally familiar with the topic, but do not know specific arguments. Therefore, be thorough in your explanations and don't assume I know what you're talking about. I can handle speed to some extent, but do keep in mind that I don't judge often. Thus, my flowing skills are not as sharp as they use to be, slow down when reading tags and citations. 

Judging Philosophy:
Debaters need to debate in order to win.

Many debaters become so bog down in the technicalities of policy debate that they forget the point of the activity: learning in-depth about a topic, developing research, analytical and public speaking skills, and learning how to work in a team. Therefore, when I say that debaters need to debate in order to win I say this in the context of what I believe debate is. Be persuasive, be analytical and don't overly rely on your evidence to make your case for you.

Feel free to ask me for clarification before your round.
