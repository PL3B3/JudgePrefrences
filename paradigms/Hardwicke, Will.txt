  I think debate is primarily an educational activity. Fairness is mostly important as an internal link to education. Evidence supports arguments and I am inclined to support smart analytic analysis over poorly explained carded arguments. Historical analysis is particularly persuasive to me. It is, of course, important to articulate a coherent role of the ballot and impact your arguments.

I will like and respect you less if you are patently offensive.
