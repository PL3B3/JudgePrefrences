  I debated for four years for Ridge High School.

Speed: Like many other judges, I’m fine with speed as long as you are clear. I will not call evidence at the end of the round unless there is a dispute about pieces of evidence.

Standards: I generally default to a value/criterion format, but if you can justify something else I am fine with that.

Theory: I don’t like voting on theory but will do so in cases where abuse is clearly explained and explanations for why the abuse merits the ballot are clear. If theory debates ever get confusing/messy to me, I prefer to just ignore it.

In general, I would really really prefer that both debaters weigh and compare argumentation. If you can justify to me why your arguments should be preferred to your opponents beyond the generic “I outweigh on X”, your speaker points will probably rise. I especially like clear impacts, extensions, and weighing in the NR and the 2AR; I think too many debaters get caught up in the minutia of arguments during those speeches and miss the arguments they need to justify in order to win the ballot.
