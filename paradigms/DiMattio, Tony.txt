  I debated at Cathedral Prep from 1999-2003 and at Pitt from 2003-2007.

I will listen to any argument as long as it's argued well. Please tell me how to vote. Please thoroughly weigh the arguments in the round (uniqueness, links, impacts, etc.). If you decide not to tell me how to vote, then I will make a decision that you will probably think is arbitrary.

I don't have a preference for any specific argument - I will listen to and vote for anything that you want. Here are my thoughts on specific genres of arguments:
Topicality: I'm not familiar with this topic or cases on this topic, so give me a synopsis if you intend to go for topicality.
DAs: Whatever.
CPs: Whatever. Not a huge fan of theory, but I will vote on it. I probably won't be too persuaded by you reading theory blocks as fast as possible; interact with the arguments your opponent makes.
Critiques: Whatever. Please don't argue a critique that you can't explain - it's painful for everyone involved.
Case Debates: I like them, but don't feel like you have to argue case to win.

I have no preference for policy debating over critical debating, or vice versa, as long as you do a good job.

If you have specific questions that I have not addressed here, please ask me before the round and I will answer to the best of my ability.
