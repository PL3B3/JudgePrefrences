I closed out the TOC in 2011. I am graduating from Auburn University this spring with a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering and a BS in Economics.

I no longer coach or am actively involved in LD debate, but I may judge at 1-2 tournaments this year. 

A few preferences:
1. I prefer rounds which discuss the topic, not the rules of debate. This is mainly to emphasize that I am not a fan of the recent norm which has trivialized theory for the sake of winning debate rounds. I think of theory as a necessary evil to check egregiously abusive practices. I will not intervene, but I have a very low threshold for responding to low quality theory arguments. 

2. I am not a philosophy major, so I am not intimately familiar with most ethical theories (analytic philosophy) and am completely ignorant of all continental philosophy. Don't let your quality of explanation suffer for the sake of conciseness.

Defaults (from Jeff Liu):
- The resolution is a statement to be proven true by the affirmative. 
- T is an issue of competing interpretations.
- Theory is an issue of reasonability.
- Theory and topicality are reasons to reject the argument, not the debater. 
- Theory and topicality are not reverse voting issues. 
- "Offensive counter-interpretations" require arguments in favor of an RVI in order to count as voting issues. 
- Fairness and education are at least reasons to exclude the unfair or uneducational arguments.
- I will not vote on new 2AR RVIs against new 2NR theory.
- I will not assume that winning the standard automatically excludes other impacts that do not fall under the text of the criterion. The burden is on the debater to explain why arguments are precluded by his/her framework. 
- I will presume affirmative (although I prefer not to presume at all). 

Speed may be an issue, having not judged debate in over a year. Start slow and speed up; I will yell clear if I cannot flow you. 

Debate is a great activity, so most importantly, have fun and best of luck.
