  I am a fourth-year PF parent judge from Stuyvesant High School. I flow the round. Feel free to motor through your case, but don't spread or I may miss something. In rebuttal, I expect a specific response to each subpoint of each contention. In summary and/or final focus, you must extend your voters -- with your evidence -- and give me your weighing mechanism for the round. Why should I prefer your evidence over theirs? Write my ballot for me, or you'll be at my mercy. I generally sit back during cross; if you think you have gained something during cross, you or your partner must reiterate it during a subsequent speech. Any rudeness, arrogance or unprofessionalism will be reflected in your speaks. Likewise, clarity of thought and expression will be rewarded.
