  I am a fairly inexperienced parent judge. However, as an attorney with considerable interest in world affairs, I would like to think that I am capable of good decision making. That said, I do not follow SPREADING, so please slow down. If you want me to vote for you, make your arguments clear and prove that your impacts outweigh your opponents. I would say that I am more of a 'policy maker' and not up on Ks or Theory so if you want to go for either you MUST explain your arguments well.
