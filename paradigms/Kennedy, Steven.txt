  I am attorney by profession, in practice since 1974. I debated in high school and did National Moot Court in Law school
.I have been an Indiana Policy Debate Coach at Munster High School for 16 years. I have judged approximately 40- Policy rounds a year in state each year. I have qualified 13 teams for NFL Nationals and have judged 70-80 rounds at Nationals. I am essentially Policy Option-- I will vote on any Stock Issue, or on Comparative Advantages which outweigh the down side. I will vote on Topicality. I prefer substantive on case analysis, evidence and refutation. I do not like Kritiks much, but I will listen if they are well argued. I prefer somewhat moderate speed rather than spew and spread. New in the 2 is Okay. Counterplans OK, conditional not so much.
