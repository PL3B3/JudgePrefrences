  I debated CX for 4 years at Westwood Highschool, qualified for the TOC twice, and broke at multiple national circuit tournaments.

I will generally try to be as open minded as possible when it comes to judging so just do your thing and I'll be happy. There are almost zero (non-offensive) debates that CAN'T be won in front of me, so take the following list with a grain of salt.

I mostly went for kritiks my senior year but have a background in counterplan/disad debating as well.
I tend to think of topicality in terms of competing interpretations.
I generally err neg on counterplan theory
A well run framework argument is fine, but I'm generally unpersuaded by "not having a plan is cheating and unfair".
Speed is fine but if you're unclear it will hurt your speaks.
Dropped arguments are true arguments, but that doesn't mean you don't have to explain the warrant to a claim if the other team drops it

Prep time ends when you're done editing the document. If the round starts moving slowly because of flashing documents, we'll start taking prep for the flashing process as well.

If you have any more specific questions feel free to ask me before the round.
