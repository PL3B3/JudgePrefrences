  I prefer conventional debate, so impacts and links are paramount, but I'll take theory/kritiks too. Just keep cases organized, and please road-map. I'll flow spread, but please do it well. I emphasize syllogistic and logical arguments that are well warranted. Always watch for resolutionality--I won't even flow an argument that isn't clearly relevant.
Clash, clash, clash, and please give me voters. I have everything on the flow, but a good crystallization will sway me on clash that has pretty even impacts/links.
