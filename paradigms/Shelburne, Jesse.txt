  I debated for four years at duPont Manual High School in Louisville, KY, and I am currently a senior at Harvard College (I no longer debate).
I'm a pretty traditional LD judge: emphasize your values and value criteria, make strong contentions, and provide clear voting issues.I'm fine giving you time cues for prep, mid-speech, whatever, just let me know beforehand.I'm open both to value-based and policy-based arguments, and while I certainly won't categorically vote down theory, kritiks, or other arguments along those lines, if you're going to make them, they should be abundantly clear since I don't have much experience running them myself. If you're going to make more pragmatic, policy-based contentions, they should still link in strongly with a V/VC.I'm not a huge fan of skep; again, not an automatic vote down, but it might make a vote up more difficult. If you can make a strong case for it, go ahead, just be careful.I value good speaking skills but strong, coherent arguments are superior to an excellent speaker who doesn't say anything worthwhile.I don't necessarily default truth-testing or comparative worlds; I can be convinced either way, and I care more about the substance of the argument than the theoretical grounds for running it.Don't spread just for the sake of speed; if I can't understand you (which is possible considering I haven't debated in a while), I can't vote for you, although if you can speak quickly and clearly then by all means do what you want. I won't vote you down just because you spread, but it's your job to make sure I can understand you.Relatedly, slowing down for your contentions and then blazing through your support isn't a good strategy either.If your opponent asks for it, I do expect you to provide some sort of copy of your case, whether you flash it to them, let them look at your computer throughout the round, or provide a paper copy.I certainly will pay attention during CX and note if you get a concession, but if you don't pounce on it in rebuttals I can't do anything with it.Nothing beyond being incoherent or blatantly racist/sexist/etc. will get an automatic vote down from me. Do what you do best, just be mindful of clarity and substance.Above all, be smart, be substantive, be topical, be coherent, and make it easy for me. I don't want to have to search through my flow to find reasons for you to win.
