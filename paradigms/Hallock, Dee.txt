  I am a communications judge, no spreading.
 I prefer to judge Lincoln/Douglas and Public Forum.
I have been judging debate for over 25 years and I have been a debate coach for the last 14 years.
I prefer debates where there are a smaller number of well-developed arguments as opposed to debates with 11 off. It means develop your arguments, and make the block small and deep, In general the team with the better explained, better developed arguments will win the debate.
I prefer to view the debate as a policy maker.
I want to hear deeper arguments rather than many shallow points. I want to hear the arguments behind the evidence (policy) and see clash between the two sides.
I expect good voting calculus: Explain to me the reasons for your value/criterion/standard to be the superior in the round.
Finally, keep it civil. If I detect poor sportsmanship or a bad attitude your speaker points and comment sheets will reflect my perception.
