 C/X and Policy Debate Paradigm: Games-player
 
-  Theory: I will vote on any theoretical obligation that is well warranted for a vote. Theory can also target exclusion of advantages or other arguments. Comparing interpretations and standards is essential to a good theory debate. Dropped theory arguments are easy ways to lose in front of me, the less work I have to do the better, but impact them well.
 
- Topicality: I find myself being quite receptive to good T arguments. Make sure to explain exactly what your interpretation is and what it allows and disallows, as well as why this is important. However, I won’t vote for just any T voter, no matter how legitimate, if the affirmative can prove it is illegitimate or unwarranted.
 
- Kritiks: I do vote on critical arguments fairly often. It’s important to explain how you want your arguments to function, clearly articulate the link stories and the implications. Kritiks are powerful, except when an inexperienced and poorly read debater tries to read advanced philosophy as fast as he/she can without explaining it.
 
-  Counterplans: Make your net benefits clear and make sure to weigh any solvency deficit. I feel relatively strongly that all permutations need to have actual texts. I will listen and potentially vote for any type of counterplan, though I tend to give less weight to consult counterplans and process counterplans as the evidence is generally not as specific to the Aff plan.
