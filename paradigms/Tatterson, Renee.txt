I like a nice logical argument that demonstrates an in depth understanding of your value and criterion. I expect these to be supported with facts in your contentions. I prefer quality over quantity. A presentation that is; moderately fast, clear and concise, well structured, well supported and connected back to the resolution is what I am looking for. Theoretical arguments are fine if you understand the theory, can clearly explain it and connect it to the resolution. If you make unsupported or unrealistic claims you will be dropped. 


I enjoy a good clash, that is about the resolution, value, criterion and contentions. Keep it real and enjoy the moment. Be polite in the round and donâ€™t step on the cross x. Tell me what matters, why it matters and why I should agree with your position.
