 I debated for Law Magnet High School in Dallas, TX for four years primarily at the local and state level with some national experience. I taught at TDC but have not judged regularly, so this page will be brief.
 
I am open to any type of argumentation so long as a clear decision calculus has been justified and proven preferable within the round. To avoid my misinterpreting any arguments, please explain the function of your arguments in relation to the decision calculus. Explicate how that argument interacts with those of your opponent and organize your speeches accordingly. In your final speech, I would like to know what arguments to prioritize in the round, as well as why and how they should be weighed. 
  
 Theory: so long as a clear violation has been presented, I rely on the basic structure of theory in which an interpretation, violation, standard(s), and voter(s) are presented. Within this, I expect an explanation of how and why I should prioritize your theory argument.
  
 Critical args: I am not well versed in critical literature, so you may have to overcompensate for my lack of knowledge by speaking slowly. You should use your critical analyses to create a coherent story. 
  
 Speed: I probably cannot follow your warrants at your top speed, but you don’t have to speak conversationally. I want to understand your arguments in the way that you intend to present them, so just be articulate and persuasive. 
 
Remember to always be respectful. Don’t hesitate to ask me questions!
