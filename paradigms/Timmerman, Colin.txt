  TLDR; I’m relatively traditional and I prefer a slow, simple and topical debate round. Refrain from complicated philosophy or arguments over debate norms (aka theory).

I debated for three years at Valley High School in WDM, IA and experienced a wide variety of debate styles. However, I have been out of the game for nearly four years and am a bit rusty. That being said, if you take it easy and give me a clearly defined case, there should be no problems.

A few things:
I prefer a more traditionally styled round. I like debates where cases compete on the basis of value, criterion, and contentions. If you’d like to put a twist on this, feel free as long as you clearly explain it to me.On that note, clearly explain everything you are doing. I will not make logical jumps through hoops for you. If I don’t understand it, I’m not voting for it.I flow slower than most people. I completely understand wanting to spread so you can get all your points out, I’ve been there. But clearly establishing your argument concisely will do way more for you with me in the long run than leaving me with half-recorded jumbles of nonsense. I’ll give out one warning but beyond that, you’re on your own.Don’t run theory. I’ll allow it if your opponent is actually running something unfair. Otherwise, make my life easier and just don’t do it.I have some background in philosophy. You can assume I at least know the basics.Don’t be a jerk. Few things irk me as much as this in debate. You don’t have to bend over backwards for your opponent and I expect competiveness, but if you are unnecessarily mean to your opponent or demean them, I’m nuking your speaker points. However, I will not drop someone based on in-round conduct unless it becomes severe.
Best advice I can give you: your first job is not to beat your opponent, but to convince me that you have beaten your opponent.
