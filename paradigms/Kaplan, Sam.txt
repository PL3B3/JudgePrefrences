Re: Judging JV Finals at Georgetown

So, uh, my name is Sam Kaplan

I'm a senior... NOW

I debated in THIS tournament

I don't like doing work for teams

The team who lets me do no work - I will automatically vote for

Oh wait, that sounded wrong

I just want you to explain and impact your own arguments

Yeah...


Re: The Flow

Answering arguments is important

Imagine you are in class, and are having an argument with the teacher

If they make an argument, you would respond on point to that argument, right?

Otherwise all the points they are making go unanswered, and you look silly in front of the rest of the class.

And then the principal calls your parents and tells them that you have been arguing with the teacher again.

And you try to explain, but no one gets what you were trying to do, and you end up getting grounded for a weekend

Your entire Friday just got ruined

Luckily, Shawn shows up in his BMW and you sneak out of your room and head to Alex's party.

But then you get a call saying Alex's parents are home, and you freak out because your whole night is ruined again

So you just end up driving around in Shawn's car, wondering how your life would have been different if you had been born hispanic

Maybe Peurto Rican



So yeah...
