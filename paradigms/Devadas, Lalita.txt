Card clipping/cross-reading:
Clipping is defined as representing that you have read 5 or more words of evidence than you actually read. Evidence must be both verbally and physically marked during your speech. It is punishable with a loss and 0 speaker points for the offender. A false accusation is punishable with a loss and 0 speaker points for both debaters from the accusing team. In the event of an accusation, I will inform both teams of the possible consequences. The accusing team will have one opportunity to withdraw their allegation. If the accusation is not withdrawn, I will then decide, to the best of my ability, whether intentional clipping occurred, using all available resources (video recordings, audio recordings, speech documents). Considering that this is a novice division at a regional tournament, I will only penalize teams if I am sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the clipping was intentional. These guidelines would be overriden by any official tournament rules.
