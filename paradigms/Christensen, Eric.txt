Red Ape. No poaching please!

I am not going to go too greatly in depth for this philosophy. Dana
Christensen in my brother and I taught him everything he knows. With that
being said if you have questions about how I might judge a round you can
look at his philosophy, I think nearly all of it applies to me as well. I
am also a four year debater from Millard North and spent two years
debating at the University of Iowa. I consider myself a strong flower and
will hold you to the flow but I also believe that truth trumps tech. So
just because you have more dropped arguments doesnâ€™t mean you are going to
win. I was initially skeptical of non-traditional debate but have now come
to see its value within the community. I am equally willing to listen to
traditional debates. I would say that 95% of my 2NRs as a debater were
politics debates. I was also the politics update person for every team I
have been on. It is near and dear to me. Would love to hear some politics
rounds. I did work at a summer camp so I am familiar with the basics of
the topic but this will be my first round this year. Overall, do what you
do best and have fun.
