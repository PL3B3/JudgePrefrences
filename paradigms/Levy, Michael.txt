  I am a Walt Whitman H.S. parent judge with no debate background and minimal judging experience.

My guess is that you now know everything you need to know.

I can't handle speed or theory.
I am a lawyer, not a philosopher, by training. Never even took a philosophy class.
I understand the basic rules of LD debate and can flow (if you speak slowly enough).
I am well-intentioned and will do my best to be fair.
I don't need to agree with your position to think you prevailed.
If I cannot figure out the words you are speaking, I won't think that you prevailed.
If I cannot figure out what you are trying to communicate, I won't think that you prevailed.
