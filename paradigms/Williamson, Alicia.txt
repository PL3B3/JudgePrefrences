Voting Issues:
Topicality: Yes. The resolution is there for a reason. If you don't debate it, you have no chance of winning.
Speed: Eh. I can handle it; I prefer not to for my sanity.
Value/Criterion: Necessary to case construction. Do not always vote on it, depends on how it used in round.
Flowing: Key. If you can't tell that I'm keeping up and adjust accordingly, you are not helping yourself succeed. The best debaters I have ever seen paid attention to me as their judge, and if I wasn't flowing their responses, or could tell I was confused, slowed down and made sure I was keeping up. 
Use of philosophy: Yes, please. These are the best types of LD rounds. It's supposed to be rooted in philosophy and theoretical.
