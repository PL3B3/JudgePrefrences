  TOC 2014 update:
I haven't judged in a while, so, especially for the first few rounds, you should definitely slow down in front of me. In terms of my judging style, while I have claimed to be a blank slate before, I have found that most kritikal, pre-fiat arguments tend to leave a bad taste in my mouth. I highly suggest you do not make these kinds of arguments in front of me, or that if you choose to do so, you wow me. Aside from that, I consider myself a decently competent blank slate thats fine with pretty much anything. 

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them :D
