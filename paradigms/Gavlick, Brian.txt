  I competed in high school Lincoln-Douglas debate, and I've judged LD debate and Public Forum debate for about three years.
I expect competitors to be polite to each other.
On speed, I accept high paced speaking, but I dislike spreading. I prefer competitors to speak as if they were running for public office.
When judging, I attempt to be a blank slate. I follow the flow, which is why I ask competitors to supply me both with a clear framework for the debate and key voting issues in their final speeches. I enjoy philosophical debate, but I appreciate well analyzed empirical evidence. I dislike calling for evidence, so if a particular card is important to the round, be sure to analyze it in round so I understand it's significance.
I like philosophical arguments, and I appreciate strong empirical analysis, but the debater must provide his or her own analysis as it pertains to the round and demonstrate an understanding of the evidence they are using.
Feel free to keep track of your own time during speeches. I still keep track of time, and if there is a conflict, I'm going by my timer.
