  I don't like speed, talk at a regular pace.You can use a computer, but don't let it cover your face.I don't allow flex-prep, but you can use your prep time to ask clarification questions about the evidence.I don't like to vote on end of the world scenarios.I want to see clash, and I want weighing at the end of the round. Make it clear at the end of the round why you won.
