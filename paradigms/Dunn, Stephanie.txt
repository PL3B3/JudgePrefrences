Debate & Forensics Coach/OC Teacher
Rogers Heritage High School

Currently I coach for Rogers Heritage HS. Going way back, I competed all four years for Truman HS in Independence, MO in both Champ CX and forensics. I debated at Missouri State for a short time before transferring to Pittsburg State where I competed in and was the assistant coach for their forensics team. Later I went on to coach Parli and Forensics at the University of Oklahoma. 

Honestly my judging philosophy is quite simple – show me what you’ve got. I am fine with speed, kritiks, and theory, really anything you think you can sell, go for it. Speak clearly – be honest with yourself about your limits for speed. Also, don’t be rude unnecessarily.
