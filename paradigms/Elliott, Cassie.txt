POLICY
What to do:
DAsCPsGood on-case argumentsBe topicalAdvantages should be grounded in reality. Not everything needs to result in nuclear war, genocide, or the death of baby penguins.Impact and implication matters

What you should keep in mind:
Ks- I have a lot of experience in theory/philosophy, however, this is POLICY debate. The K needs to make sense and I do NOT believe multiple worlds exist when making a NEG strat.Speed- I'f I can't flow you b/c you are too fast or unclear that is your fault not mine and I may not vote on an argument you know you made.Performance- be a good sport- CX matters to me- it's binding.
Side notes:
Appearance and good etiquette matter. The end.

What to do:
Fair and Equitable Definitions for a balanced AFF/NEG debate.Observations in framework matter to me- you should have/use them but they should not be abusive.Value and Value Criterion should make sense given the resolutions intention and your contentions should link back to the V/VC debate.Contentions should be supportive of your overall argument and clear.Rebuttals matter- Clash matters- be responsive2AR/2NR- make sure you prove to me why you have WON the debate not why your opponent lost. This means you do impact work with outweigh arguments.
