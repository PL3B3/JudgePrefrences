  I currently at a coach at a high school in LA's UDL. I am a recent USC graduate, where I was primarily a 2A running affirmatives with plan texts and social justice-y advantages over the course of 3 years. I debated 4 years in high school at Saint Francis HS in CA before then.

For the HS oceans topic, I have mostly judged JV level debates so far this year. Please take care to explain your terms. 

You should feel comfortable running anything in front of me. I will try my best to make the debate safe and flow less traditional arguments to be faithful to the performance, including any affective results. Please be respectful of people in the debate space and try to have fun! 

Prep time ends when the flash drive leaves your computer.

Below are just thoughts about contentious things I have run into judging/debating in the past:

Framing (both role of my ballot and impact framing) is important. You should seek to control the most meta-level debate structure claim; that will characterize how I evaluate the individual components of each teamâ€™s competing story.

Offense and defense matter but I don't vote automatically on dropped arguments unless you call a TKO: Technical drops are not always conceptual dropped arguments and require extra impact explanation, not mere extension.

Presumption is neg until an alternative advocacy is offered, then it goes aff. I don't see presumption as about "least change."
