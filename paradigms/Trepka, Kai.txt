I prefer policy/policy-like debates. Line-by-line and tech are critical. This doesn't mean you need cards for every argument you make, but it does mean you need to make coherent arguments grounded in logic and/or evidence, and respond to each of your opponents' arguments that are similarly grounded.
Impact calculus frames how I evaluate each argument. This can occur at the internal link or terminal impact level - good debaters will do both.
Creative advantage counterplans are always a plus - but counterplans that could result in the affirmative are suspect, unless there is a robust literature distinguishing the two policies.
Topicality is crucial to limit the size of this topic. That being said, impact calculus is necessary here as well.
