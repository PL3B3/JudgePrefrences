I debated in high school for four years and currently go to UC Berkeley. I don't debate in college but attempt to still be active in the debate community. However, I'd definitely advise you to stay away from using any topic-related acronyms because I don't keep up with them. 

At the end of the round, I need to hear how you and your partner believe the round should be framed and compare that reason to the other team's. I don't have a preference towards what type of arguments you run as long as there's clash and explanations for why your arguments are viable. I will not believe an argument if you're only doing tagline extensions. That's not debating.

I was a 2A/1N when I debated. I rarely took the kritik in the block. In order to win the round on a kritik, you have to argue it like any other debate argument which means I expect structure and clash. As long as that happens, running a kritik is definitely fine. 

I will flow as long as you are clear. Do not only be clear on the taglines. I like to hear the warrants of the cards you're reading and murmuring through them won't help.
