  AFFILIATION: Assistant coach at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School

I debated throughout high school and college (and judged my fair share of high school rounds and part-time coached for a couple of years), but took off nearly 10 years to pursue a legal career. I am now volunteering my time and am getting back in the activity. Please remember that there is a large chunk of time (2002-2010) for which I am unfamiliar with the arguments and the literature. However, I am eager to listen to topicality and counterplans, disadvantages, and case arguments. As for kritiks, I am interested in listening to them and I vote on them often (I have seen plenty of great kritik debates), but to secure my ballot, I expect that you will do more than talk at an extremely high level about metaphysics and epistemology. 

Remember that debate is a persuasive activity so persuade me to vote for you and if you present the most compelling case, that should be the direction I vote. Please do not forsake clarity for sheer speed. I really enjoy debates that show some creativity and meaningful thought put into the strategy. I loathe to recreate the round by reading a pile of evidence. Please number your arguments and try to create flowable clash--it makes my job much better.
