When judging a Lincoln Douglas debate, I expect to observe the following:
Clashing with civility with the understanding that historically, ethics and philosophy are central to the LD format Outstanding oratory with appropriate speed (7), tone and emphasis on a few compelling statements Effective use of the connection of the value to the resolution; it’s a “values debate”Please make eye contact; don’t hide behind your notes or computer
