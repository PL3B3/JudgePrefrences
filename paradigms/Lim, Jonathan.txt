  I am currently the Head Coach at Sacred Heart Cathedral in San Francisco. I debated for 4 years in High School, but was mainly a Policy Debater. I help with the LD program currently, and am experienced enough to judge LD.

For the most part, I like the line-by-line debate and consider myself a tabula rasa judge. I will also vote on Topicality if the debaters are compelling enough.
