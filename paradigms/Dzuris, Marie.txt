  Judging philosophy - Marie Dzuris 
Centerville High School 



My philosophy is not extraordinarily difficult - if I can understand it I will listen to it. I will not read the cards to do the work for you. There must be some explanation to go with the cards. 
The critique, when spewed at a millions words a minute, is a mystery to me, so much so that I probably won't even know it exists. I have some difficulty with heavy philosophy debated at the level. However, I am not opposed to the idea per se. If you want me to vote on the critique, there must be a civilized discussion of it. Reading page long cards to me and expecting me to digest them will not help you or your speaker points - enough said. 
Impact assessments, time frame analysis, etc. needs to be made by you. I will not assign any preconceived impacts to any argument. I will do as you tell me (within reason). Telling me "to just read the cards" will leave me confused (more than usual) and looking elsewhere to decide. 
Topicality - it’s hard to get me to play little semantic games. However, as with the critical arguments, if you can sell it, I will listen to it.  
Theory arguments in general – not a fan of ridiculous things becoming a voting issue – like no capitalized word, etc. It will be very hard for you to convince me to take such arguments seriously. Please don’t waste my time. 
Finally, rudeness has no place in debate and I am quite intolerant of it. Treat your partner and your opponents with respect and there will be no problems.
