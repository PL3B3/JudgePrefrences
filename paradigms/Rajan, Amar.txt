  I am an experienced parent judge. Though I have never personally been involved with competitive debate, I have watched and judged many rounds on a local, district, state, and national level because of my daughter's involvement with the activity. I dont mind debaters who speed through cards, but make sure you signpost well and slow down for author's names and your analysis. Clarity is key for debaters who choose to speed, I will yell clear three times before I stop flowing. I have seen many debaters who speed well, with the same clarity as their conversational pace. Conversely, I have struggled to understand many slow debaters and have yelled clear in a slow round.
If you are going to run theory, explain it fully.
I try not to infer anything, but some debates will require me too. That said, voters are important. As you have probably heard many times before, tell me why you win the ballot.
Unlike some judges, I listen to cross examination and consider it for speaks and sometimes in a decision. If you make a point in cross ex, please don't drop it in your speech. I cannot consider that point, good as it may be, for the actual round.
If you are a debater who only uses a string of cards and lots of jargon, I am not your judge.
