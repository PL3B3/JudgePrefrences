  In terms of standard judging paradigms, I consider myself a policy maker judge. Clearly explain how your plan solves and my vote is yours. That being said, if you decide to run a kritik, please understand it in its entirety. If you don’t understand your kritik, don’t run it; it wastes everyone’s time. Although I don’t prefer to hear topicality debates, I understand that there are times when you encounter an affirmative case where you have no answers. If you can prove that they are truly not affirming the resolution, I will vote on topicality. Use your rebuttals wisely. Don’t repeat arguments from your constructives; take them one step further and tell me why you deserve my vote. Make smart arguments, be logical and don’t bullshit.
