  My name is Ryan Freund and I competed in Debate at Bettendorf High School. I have been judging LD for Bettendorf over the last few years, mainly at local Iowa events. I can handle speed and will vote on any argument you present in the round. I accept any structure you give me in debate (value/criterion, burden, etc.), just ensure you are impacting back to the framework you present in round. Beyond that, if you have any questions, ask me before the round begins.
