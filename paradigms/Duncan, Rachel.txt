  I am a former PF Debater, I judge based on flow. 

If you ask me to drop something, turn something, or impact something, etc. you MUST quantify it - give me a reason on your behalf why the argument should go to you. 

As a PFer I am able to keep up with quick talking but full on spreading is difficult for me since I never had much experience with it. 

If I am judging you in PF I strongly believe that this style of debate is for the Public, as the name entails, therefore I believe Kritiks, Counterplans, etc. have NO place in a PF round. Obviously, this is not the case with LD or CX, all of those things may be applied in a Lincoln Douglass or Policy round.
