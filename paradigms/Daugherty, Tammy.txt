  Debate Experience: Coach for 8 years: 3 in Nebraska, 5 in Indiana. First Diamond awarded in summer of 2008.
Paradigm: All events: Tab judge.

Policy: I will vote on any position as long as it is well debated. I can handle speed, but clarity is always a bonus. I will vote on off-case and on-case positions. I have had experience with National Circuit judging and coaching. I will vote on T, but I do enjoy standards and voters, so keep that in mind. Debate is a rule-oriented event, and I like standards whenever possible. I will also vote on CPs and theory--just make them clear. I'm fine with National Circuit debate tactics (tag-teaming, no new in two, etc.). Just ask if there is anything special. I'll probably just go with the flow...

LD: I will vote on whatever standards are presented in the round: If we're going to debate philosophy, fine; if we're debating harms/benefit analysis, fine. I don't weigh one standard as being intrinsically more important than another. I can also flow speed, but I will dock points if the speech cannot be understood clearly. This is a speaking event. Negatives can run a case, or if they want to run a critique, I'm fine with that. I'll vote on who is the better debater.
