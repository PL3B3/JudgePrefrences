  I am a solely stock issue judge.

Topicality - does the aff fit under this year's resolution?

Harms: What are the problems in the status quo?

Inherency: Are steps being taken in the status quo to solve the harms?

Solvency: How does your plan specifically solve the harms?

Disadvantage: I am aware that there are very generic disadvantages such as the politics DA. I will tell you that I am not at all familiar with them; however, I am more than happy to judge a debate with a disadvantage that makes logical sense and is backed by evidence. Do not use jargon such as uniqueness, internal link, and link because I will not understand that. Do good work on the impact debate and prove that the disadvantage is worse than the harms of the affirmative. 

Your best bet is to go slow in front of me. I will not listen to spreading under any circumstances. In the case that both teams spread and I cannot understand what they say, I will default to a coin flip. I enjoy smart analysis and in-depth argumentation over shotgunning the affirmative to see what sticks.
