Theory is always important, but if you have real world examples to back up that theory, then that's good too.

Speed: I have no issues with speed, but remember, quality is more important than quantity. If you have 100 really weak arguments but your opponent has 10 really strong ones, chances are good that I will vote for the opponent.

Voters: Please give me a couple of voters (if not more) towards the end of your rebuttal. If you are Aff, please use the 2AR to clear up any issues in the round and then give me voters. If you are Neg, please use the last couple of minutes of the NR to clear up any issues in the round and then give me voters.

Don't be rude during CX. I will dock you a speaker point or two if you are. Always be civil.
