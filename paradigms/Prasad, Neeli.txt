  My judging preference for Parli is old school. 


Speed: prefer debaters to avoid spreading and focus on articulation. 


Framework: essential to define the framework of the debate from the start and clearly address opponentsâ€™ and your own points as you move through the debate 

Respectful and professional demeanor is preferred.

POIs: Be courteous.
