  I am a parent judge from Syosset, NY.

Quality and delivery of speech are the most 2 important factors to me. Do try to extend your arguments\cards throughout the round. I will not intervene and expect you to tell me why I should vote for you. Make sure you have all the evidences ready to be inquired\called regardless it is on the paper or on the computer. 
Do not read off cases and please speak clearly. If you think you are too fast, you probably are too fast. It is a waste of good speech if no one can understand you.
Please respect your opponent and keep the debate professional.
I prefer the traditional value criterion and contention model of debate.
