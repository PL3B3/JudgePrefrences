  Hey my name is Michael, email: mcasas1289@yahoo.com
Experience; 3 years of High School debate ( University High School ) 
 Starting College debate for Rutgers this year.
EXPLAIN what i should vote for you and make it clear. Once you make your point MOVE ON, please don't repeat yourself in the same speech.
Organize your arguments. Line-Line is nice too. 
Spreading is acceptable but be clear. I will call out clear when you are unclear TWICE. After that I will just stop writing.
Im pretty liberal so you can any type of argument as long as you can convince me 
Critical Affs are cools, explain why we should start with your point and their impacts. 
All Neg Stats are acceptable but please present them clearly so i know when you're starting a new argument. 
Theory is beautiful but make it clear to the judge. No vague interpretations, and slow down when you read your interpretations.
I flow cross ex too, so i bind you to it.
Impact debate must include a serious impact calculus, link debate wouldn't hurt either.
PREP TIME; I expect the debaters to time themselves, confirm with your opponents as well. Im pretty lenient when it comes to flashing or emailing without using your prep but please don't take advantage. I wouldn't mind being part of the email chain or flash chain either.
Cross ex; Open cross ex is acceptable but please remember that you might take your partners chance of gaining more speaker points.
Don't be rude, I understand when you're hyped but no rude language.
