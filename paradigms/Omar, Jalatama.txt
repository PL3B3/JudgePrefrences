  Formerly a debater at Sioux Falls Washington high school in Lincoln Douglas debate.

SPEED

No preference on speed just be understandable.

Framework

Value debate:
-Morality is not a value
Criterion debate:
-I am philosophy heavy, being a debater from South Dakota I learned to debate more traditional, but I will flow all frameworks and have no preferences to style of debate.


Argumentation
-I will flow all arguments.
- The arguments should link back to the framework.
-If the debate is focused on the contention level, that is where I will vote in the round.


Theory
-In order to vote on theory, I must believe that there is in round abuse.

K's
-Kritiks are fine as long as it relates to the issues/burdens of the opposition.
