Most of my experience in debate was in LD. Even though I am less familiar with K's, DA's, T, CP's, etc., I will listen to whatever you've got as long as it is well warranted and explained. Moreover, all arguments should be weighed and extended in order for me to evaluate them in the round.

Even though I vote off of the flow, performance matters. This means that persuasive speakers will be rewarded with higher speaker points. I can handle speed, just make sure you're clear. This is pretty important because if I miss something on the flow, I'm probs not going to vote on it.
