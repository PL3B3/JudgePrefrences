Clarity is next to godliness. 


I am disheartened by this turn in debate to hear an "overview of the k" discussing how it turns the case and outweighs. Why have an alternative if you are going for a d/a? You dont need an alternative: the status quo is always an option, or better yet not the aff. 


Arguments I will most likely vote against: West is Best, Cap good, racism good, slavery not that bad, sexism good, homophobia good, and banal policy framework. 


Aesthetics I will factor into my decision: your body (language) towards the other team
