I am generally Tabula Rosa, as long as you explain your reasoning fully. I will not flow what you are saying if I can't understand you, and I prefer a normal-paced speed. I will stop flowing if you go too fast.

I don't love Kritiks, but if you can make it make sense, then I have no problem voting on it. You must explain my role as the judge in the round as well as the role of the ballot. I default to a policy-making framework.

Topicality is fine, as long as it's not stupid and as long as you make me know that you understand your arguments. I tend to ignore one-word theory arguments like 'predictability', 'time skew', 'reasonability', and 'fairness' unless you explain to me the in-round impacts on them and their importance in the round.

Keep your explanations to the point and don't speak yourselves in circles. If you don't have anything else to say, stop speaking.

Don't do stupid things; don't be rude to me, your opponents, or your partner. I will vote down excessive disrespect. You will lose speaker points for being impolite. Have fun, it's only a debate. If you take it too seriously I might think you feel like you are losing. Act like you are winning at all times, and I may just believe your arguments a tad more than if you look unconfident in your strategy.

Overall, explain well and have fun, and you'll do great.
