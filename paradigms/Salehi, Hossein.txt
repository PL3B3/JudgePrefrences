Affiliation:
Chaminade College Prep

Background: I am a parent no previous debate judging experience. I have a Ph.D in economics and have taught economics at the graduate level for over 25 years. 

Paradigm: In my opinion, the performance component of Lincoln-Douglas debate is very important so I place a fair amount of weight on delivery. I will not accept spreading and will mark debaters down if I feel they are speaking too quickly. I prefer clarity, analysis and synthesis; it is important that you persuade me. The overuse of jargon weakens a debaterâ€™s argument in my mind. I also want to see distinct clash in debates. It is very important that debaters clearly delineate which argument they are addressing; otherwise it makes it more difficult for me to follow their line of reasoning.
