I like to see cases clearly linked backed the standards. I tend to favor pragmatic arguments over pure philosophy. When it comes to philosophy, I prefer simple philosophy over highly complex philosophy. When it comes to evidence, I prefer that it be clearly warranted. I try to process your arguments as the round progresses. As such, excessive speed can be detrimental. Signposts and crystallization are always helpful. Treat me like a traditional judge with an emphasis on clear communication.
