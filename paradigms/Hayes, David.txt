My Background
 
I am not a former debater. I am a recent career-changer to teaching (2008), and I became involved in debate when the head coach needed someone to help out. I assumed the head coach role at King College Prep two years ago. We are a member of the Chicago Debate League, and we do not generally compete on the National Circuit. This year, we have a few debaters whose accomplishments and skill have earned them the right to compete at this level.

Speed
 
I am not a speed listener, so you’ll need to be slow and clear on the tags and citations. No argument is strong if I can’t flow it, and if you notice that I’m not writing anything down, you should adjust your speed.


Arguments
 
I'm open to pretty much any argument, if it's done well, but I'm not personally engaged by topicality arguments. Because I have not yet judged much at the national level, you shouldn't assume that I'm aware of or experienced with the arguments you're making. So *make* your arguments, don't just make some shorthand reference to it and assume I'll know what that reference means.

I won't do the debating for you; if your opponents drop an argument - and you want me to consider it important - you should bring it up in your speech. 

I won't spend 20 minutes post-round gathering your evidence and reconstructing the debate; I'm looking for you to make arguments and persuade me in the round.

--

Be clear, don't assume prior knowledge of your cases and arguments, and be persuasive in the round.
