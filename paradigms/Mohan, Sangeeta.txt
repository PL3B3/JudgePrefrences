  I am a parent judge, but I've been judging for the last 3-4 years so I'm familiar with L-D. Both of my daughters compete in the event, so I'm familiar with the topic.
I prefer more traditional cases - theory, kritiks, and counterplans aren't things I'm wild about.
You can speak slightly above a conversational speed, and I will let you know if you're going too fast.
