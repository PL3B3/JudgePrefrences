  -Speed is fine as long as you speak clearly. If I cannot understand you, I will stop flowing and will not be able to evaluate your arguments. 
-Strive for framework clash and weighing for an interesting debate. Thoroughly justify your value so I know how to consider the round.
-Compare impacts to show how and why your arguments outweigh or turn your opponent’s. Explain why your impacts mean you win.
-Extend all arguments (with warrants and impacts!) to show cohesion, but without being redundant. Effectively respond to your opponent’s arguments as well. I notice dropped arguments.
-Make time for voters and crystallization. Make the round as clear as possible for me. 
-If you use philosophies, make sure you explain them well enough for me to understand. I won’t always be familiar with authors or philosophies you use, so I like to hear logical explanations.
-I value persuasive speaking style; evidence should be relevant and legitimate but you need to do the work to convince me to vote for you.
-I like to see polite behavior throughout the round. I give speaker points to those who approach debate with a humble and respectful attitude.
