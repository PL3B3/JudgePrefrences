  General- I have debated 4 years for the cal parli team. I am fine with anything you are willing to do in a debate round. Speed is fine. Theory is fine. Policy arguments are fine. I tend to default to a more policy oriented judging philosophy but if you give me a different framework I will happily apply it. In short, do whatever you want to do and tell me what it means in terms of my ballot. I have limited LD background so you may need to explain some arguments better.
Procedurals: In a vacuum I view procedurals as a matter of competing interpretations however I am open to any framework. Run whatever procedural you want if you have good standards arguments you will probably win it.
D/A â€“CP- I view this as an intuitive way to debate. I am fine with their applicability to LD.
Kritiks- I have run them extensively at the college level so I will probably have some familiarity with your authors. I like these debates.
Underview-I think debate should be about the debaters, run whatever you like, organize your arguments well and explain how they function and you will probably win my ballot.
Feel free to ask any questions.
