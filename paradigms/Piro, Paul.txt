  I debated for 3 years at Glenbrook North. I am now a freshman debater at Michigan State.

I attempt to minimize judge intervention. If an argument is debated better, you will likely win the debate. However, I do have some caveats:

Theory: I do tend to err neg on theory questions, but I can be persuaded otherwise. You will have a low probability of winning on arguments like dispo bad. I have a high threshold on voting aff on "X" counterplan is bad. However, the possibility of winning on "X" cp is bad increases when you are debating a consult counterplan or anything of that nature. 

Kritiks: I personally am not a K debater, though that does not mean I will refuse to vote on the K. I am a much better judge for mainstream K's like cap bad, coercion, security, fem IR ect. However, I am not well-versed in obscure K literature like Deluze and Guattari. That doesn't necessarily mean you will lose the debate because you went for baudrillard, but there is a higher threshold for explanation and argumentation for that type of argument.

Performance: Strike me
