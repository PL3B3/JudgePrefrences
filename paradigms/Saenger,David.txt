  Background: I have judged Middle School Parli for many years, this is my first year in High School Debate. I am very openminded, but here are some things to keep in mind:

I prefer arguments that are organized and have evidence to support contentions. 

Redundancy is OK. Better to be redundant than to be unclear.

I have little patience for teams that complain about things that they can’t control, such as the other team’s manners or technical issues in the debate. I can tell if a team is using abusive tactics and I don’t need that pointed out to me. I don’t like complaining.

I hate it when people say “I urge a strong ballot”. What does that even mean? A ballot is a ballot, there is no such thing as a “strong” ballot. Do you want me to write an X on your ballot with blood? A win is a win and a lose is a lose. Please stop saying this phase.

Don’t swallow your words. Please speak loud and clear.

I’m open to any type of argument, but you’ll need to explain it to me for you to win. Don’t assume I know what you’re talking about. (This includes nontraditional arguments)
