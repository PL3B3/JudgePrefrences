I'm very flexible when it comes time to write my decision, and I'll generally vote for the side that best explains to me why he/she/they won the round. In other words, I'll vote using the framework that you establish for me. 

On form, signposting is important. Moderate speed is fine, but don't tread the line between moderate and excessive; when in doubt, it's probably excessive. Please don't bog debate down in evidentiary disputes - they're boring, especially as a defensive tactic.
