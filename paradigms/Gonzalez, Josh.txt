  Ill keep this short and simple 

To start off with some background information, I debated for four years in high school from 2005-09 at University HS in Newark, NJ. I managed to get one bid before becoming idle in the debate community, so I am familiar with national circuit tournaments, debaters, and arguments from all regions. Debating in the northeast has solidified my understanding and usage of Kritiks. They are my favorite arguments but please do not let it be any indication of my preference of arguments. I listen and enjoy listening to all types of arguments, especially politics. 

As a hint, I hold a higher burden for Kritik; I value explanation and analysis especially on the impact and alternative debate. And if you're going to be debating the kritik, I expect explanation of most kritical jargon-- most of the times, debaters tend to misinterpret certain words or introduce terminology to me that I am not familiar with. I love watching a politics debate, so im more easy going with politics arguments because most of the times it turns out being a card/warrant war, which I am fine with. 

I find theory debates kind of conniving in debate, but thats what makes it fun. Just make sure I hear impacts on standards. I err affirmative or negative depending on the theory argument, so if you have a favorite theoretical objection you will likely run in the round don't hesitate to ask me about my preference on that specific argument.
