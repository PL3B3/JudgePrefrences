I prefer traditional LD style using value and criterion, but other frameworks will be considered if the structure is clear. Cards must be clearly impacted.

Theory and K's have to be extremely clear, and without jargon if possible.

I will listen to what you say; make sure you tell me how you think I should vote, and why, but don't claim that you've won issues that you haven't. Explain clearly why you have won certain issues, and why those issues should determine the vote.
