  My debate experience is in high school and college policy, with a full boat of each. Love it. 

I coach mostly LD, though, and love the event's complexity. It has far more potential to be intellectually stimulating, right now, over the direction that policy is headed. I like cool arguments and creativity, but I also admire debaters that can tackle a topic head on and win with that approach. 

As for theory, anything goes, but you'd better think it through. I'm not overly persuaded by whiny, punishment theory and discussions of fairness. Just give me a theoretical paradigm that makes sense and show why this particular round benefits from that paradigm. 

As for speed, if you think that some judges just can't "handle" your speed, I'd suggest you need to work on clarity.
