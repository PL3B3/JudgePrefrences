  I currently debate for Towson University. I debated, for four years in high school for University High School.

I would like to now consider myself a performance debater, although in high school i ran both critical and policy arguments. With that being said run traditional policy arguments if you want, but if I don't understand what I'm voting for, I'm very likely not to vote. 

If the K is what you like, do that; give me a links and impacts and tell me how those impacts interact with everything else going on in the round (needs to be explained thoroughly). If you like politics, again, give me links and impacts. A good 2AR/2NR tells me how I vote and why I vote that way. 

An argument conceded is an argument won by the opposing team--unless I'm told otherwise.

Framework comes first--unless debaters tell me otherwise.

I hate theory debates, so run them at your own risk. 
In general, don't leave me to my own devices as my opinions on certain arguments tend to occasionally shift or be somewhat different than the norm. Tell me how to vote and I'll vote.
