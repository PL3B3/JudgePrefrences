  Tabula Rasa generally. I debated for edison high school for three years in high school, and debate for fresno state in college. I need a good impact calc, a framework, and if necessary, role of the ballots and judges clearly outlined to make judging easier. If you as debaters don't make it clear why your role of the ballot is superior to theirs, not only in how we come to learn, but also who has access to your method, then it makes it much harder for me to vote for you, or at least to do it comfortably and it will probably show in your speaker points. 
T- I vote for it. Ususally a pretty high threshold, just make sure the debate stays structured on this as I am more inclined to vote for tech v. truth here.
DA/CP- awesome, run them.
K- Ran it all college, having some actual belief behind your K is always good and will definitely increase your speaker points. For me, have a good explanation of the K and make sure it actually links to the aff. 
I dont count flashing as prep unless it becomes an issue
Tag team cx is ok, just know if you're one who likes to be a spectator, your speaks will reflect. 
Im good with however fast you want to go. 
Have fun!
