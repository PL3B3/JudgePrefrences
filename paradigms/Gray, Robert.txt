  Full speed spreading is not going to work for me. More than likely, I will not be able to hear or follow you.

I competed in extemp a long time ago in high school, but am rather new at LD judging. I am, however, an attorney and a member of the federal trial bar. I have also argued before the US Courts of Appeal.

So, I can usually pick up on the logic of an argument fairly quickly. And, I will pay attention to your evidence. I expect evidence to be tied logically to contentions and contentions to value statements and value statements to your final position. Pretty simple.

I don't have an issue with unique positions, so long as they are tied together succinctly. Whether you are up or down, I will do my best to provide critical feedback on everything I experience from you to help you in your next competition. You typically will not have a question as to why you won or lost, or what I thought could be improved.

I look for cross questions to be used strategically. Get the information you need to use in your rebuttal. Don't ask a question simply to ask a question . . . make sure it has meaning to your position and make sure you use the answer.

I will also be judging your delivery. This means pace (talking faster doesn't mean you necessarily have more to say), inflection, passion, eye contact (at least some), professionalism and more. You can't win on delivery alone, but it certainly can be a tie-breaker.

Most of all . . . have fun and show it.
