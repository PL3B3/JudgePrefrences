Currently a Debater for Sac City College

Preferences: There is not any argument that I won't vote on. I look for a good debate and want the debaters to make it clear for me, or a judge.
Speed is okay just make sure its clear.
I like debaters that are passionate about the subject and that is one of the key things I look for when giving out speaker points.
I enjoy a good PF round.
Flow: I flow the rounds completely and prefer that debaters keep time themselves. 


Ballot: I will look over my flows, compare impacts, and look over the overall debate, then will then make a decision. 


Oral Critique: Will give oral critiques. Verbal RFD followed by individual critique. Sometimes suggestions, sometimes criticism. You can talk to me out of round.
