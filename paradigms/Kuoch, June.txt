  Debated for Bloomington Jefferson from 2011-2015. Currently a first year at the University of Minnesota.

 Here is a little about myself: 
-I use they/them/theirs pronouns. If you fuck this up It WILL affect your speaker points I do not come to debate rounds to be micro-aggressed.


-I have judge a couple rounds on this topic. I have help a lot with debater cutting evidence on this topic so do not treat me like I am stupid. 

-I did kritical debate in high school but this does not mean I will NOT vote for framework. I would recommended running arguments that you enjoy and are comfortable with in front of me.

-I was a 2A for 3 years in school but then switched to be a 2N. 

Things that I find important: 
-Clarity. If I cannot understand you then I will not be flowing. 

-Warrants. Tell me the reasoning behind your arguments. Do not just say “You don’t get a perm it’s a method debate” tell me why they don’t the perm. 

Case: NEVER FORGOT THE CASE DEBATE! You speaker points will be higher if you have a great case debate. I love me some good impact turns. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR SHIT LIKE RACSIM GOOD THO. JUST CAN YOU NOT!

 Flashing:I prefer email chains tbh. I do not count flashing as prep unless used excessively. I know when your stealing prep just don’t do it if you do it will probs lower you speaker points I will start your prep. 

Kritiks/Performance: I love a good K debate. K turns the case is my shit. You just have to give me a good explanation of the Kritik interacts with the AFF. As stated above I have did performance debate my senior year in high school. I read arguments like queer theory, afro-pess, security, cap, fem, etc. 

Topicality: I view T as a DA. That the interp is just the link and the standers the impacts. 

DA: Anything can be a DA. I like a good DA debate but personally I find the politics debate to be boring use this information as you will. 

CP: CP are chill. A good completive CP can reck people. 

Theory: My thresh hold for theory debates is kinda of high. I will probs not vote on unless the clearly drop condo bad. 


Framework: Framework is how you frame your work.

 FINAL NOTE: Have fun. Say funny shit. Make jokes. You should be having fun when you debate because if you aren’t when why are you debating. "
