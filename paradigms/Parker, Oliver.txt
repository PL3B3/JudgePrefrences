  I am mostly a public forum debate coach, and I have judged Lincoln Douglas on the local Alabama circuit for years. I am unaccustomed to extreme speed and theory arguments prevalent on the National Circuit in Lincoln Douglas. I prefer traditional Value/Criterion Lincoln Douglas debate at a reasonable speed. However, speed, theory, kritiks, etc. will not automatically lose the round if you are clear. 

For speaking points, a 29-30 will be awarded for perfect clarity, persuasion, and appropriate body language that accompanies effective communication. Courtesy and civility to your judge and to your opponent are essential for high speaks. A 25-26 or lower will be awarded for mumbled spreading, no effort at persuasion, and no attempts at courtesy. A 27-28 will be given to those who are somewhere in between.

I enjoy Lincoln Douglas, and I would like to see all the competitors enjoy it as well. I like to see a round that stimulates our brains and teases out the intricacies of the resolution. The best rounds are those in which the competitors and the judge have a positive experience.
