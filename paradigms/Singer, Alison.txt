  I’m a parent judge for Scarsdale High School. I’ve judged varsity LD at the Newark, Bronx,
Beltway, Byram Hills, and New York State Championship tournaments and have also judged
several local New York novice and JV tournaments. I’m best at evaluating and strongly prefer
traditional, substantive debates (debate the topic!).

Speed: A brisk pace is fine, but please don’t do your fastest spreading. I’ll say “clear” if you’re
going too quickly.

Theory: I don’t have much experience evaluating theory, and I’d really rather not hear it. If your
opponent does something that’s clearly very unfair, please explain why they’re being unfair as
you would explain any other argument in the round (not in shell form). If you make an argument
like this, you can make the implication to drop either the argument or the debater.

Weighing: YES!

Voters: I find them extremely helpful, so leave time for them at the end of the 2AR/2NR.

CX: I don’t flow CX. If something comes up in CX that you want on the flow please bring it up
during a subsequent speech.

Ks, Micropolitcs, anything with a “Role of the Ballot”: No. I am pretty convinced that the role
of the ballot is to communicate the judge’s decision to the Tabroom. Let’s leave it at that.
Plans, Counterplans, and Disads: All fine.

Be nice, have fun, and please be respectful! Don’t do things like calling your opponent stupid,
especially if the round is clearly unevenly matched. This has happened, and I have deducted
speaker points.

Additionally, I often bring cookies or granola bars to rounds and offer them to the debaters.
Acceptance or non-acceptance of the cookies will not affect my decision or your speaker points. :)
