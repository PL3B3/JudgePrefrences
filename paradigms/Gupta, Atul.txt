  This is my 8th year judging. My daughter was a 4-year successful LD competitor. My son graduates this year as a 4-year parli debater. I have judged at the local league, the CHSSA championships, NCFL and NFL nationals and many invitationals, including Stanford and Berkeley. Over time, I have stressed that my ballot is won by effective communication. I expect you to present your arguments with clarity, have appropriate warrants and impact arguments. Speed is an issue with me because it is counterproductive in effective communication. I flow and appreciate it if you identify where you will be arguing first. Dropped or unaddressed arguments are a problem for me, as are late/new arguments. I do a great deal of team judging, so if you have a proposition of policy, I expect that you will provide a plan that addresses the classic voter issues.
