Hello, I'm an Emory graduate. I did LD in high school.

I don't judge very often, so go a bit slower. this also means I won't be up on latest crazes or whatever but I'm open to arguments about whatever they are.

I've done policy for Emory before so I'm familiar with policy arguments.

I won't not vote on a certain type of argument on principle but I might subconsciously be biased against disclosure theory and other exceedingly frivolous theory.

Speaker points awarded based on creativity and implementation of your strategy. You'll probably lose points for being excessively harsh to an opponent much younger/more inexperienced than you.
