  I graduated in 2011 from Torrey Pines High School where I did 4 years of LD.

My goal as a judge is to intervene as little as possible. Provide clear impacts and a comprehensive weighing analysis, and you'll win the round. With that said, I'm willing to vote on any argument as long as it's articulated coherently.

I can handle speed, but know that I haven't done research on this topic. Be sure to slow down for crucial parts of your case (i.e. author names, taglines, etc.) and dense arguments.

If you have any additional questions on my judging paradigm, please ask me before the round.

Good luck and have fun! :-)
