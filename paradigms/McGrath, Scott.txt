  Mostly Tabula Rasa
Strong background in philosophical and legal literature
I enjoy K debates, but with a few caveats:
1) I prefer rhetoric and reps Ks to Ks of social systems
2) If you K something that is systemic in society you have to show that my ballot spills over or that solving for those in the room creates a real benefit
