  In my opinion everything is for you to argue in round. I expect the debaters to tell me why T/K/Speed is good/bad. I dislike poorly run arguments. Your T should have standards and voters and you should be articulating to me why the standards/voters are good/necessary. I would love to hear your critical arguments, but run them well because chances are that I know what theory you're talking about as well or better than you do. Other than that, the only thing that really irritates me are ill mannered debaters. I don't really care if you sit or stand or whether you thank me fifteen times before the round is over, but don't be rude to one another, you should want your opponent to understand your arguments. . .it's better for debate.
