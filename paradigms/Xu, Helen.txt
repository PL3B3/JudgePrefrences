  Background:
I debated for Edgemont and went to the TOC twice. I don't debate anymore and have limited knowledge about the topic, but I should be fine as long as you explain your positions.
General:
Any argument is fine, as long as you debate it well. Impact calculus on any position is important, whether its T, DAs, etc. The following are my initial thoughts but can always be changed.

T/theory:
Can be trite but may be necessary. I feel like aff teams don't use theory enough as neg teams read questionable cps, but do whatever you want. I don't really know what's accepted as topical/not topical this year, so don't make assumptions.

DAs/CPs:
Better you've researched and have a specific strategy.

Ks:
I don't know too much about them, just explain your argument. Be specific ie make your links/arguments relevant to the aff.


Feel free to ask me questions about anything before the debate.
