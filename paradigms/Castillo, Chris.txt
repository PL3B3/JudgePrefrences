Lincoln-Douglas Debate Paradigm
 Feel free to ask me questions before the round. Here are some answers to questions that people usually ask:
Are you okay with speed? I think I'm okay with it. If you are speaking too quickly I'll let you know. Speak at whatever pace you're most comfortable with and please be clear.
Do you like "weird arguments"? I'm okay with whatever you want to run. I won't get excited just because you name drop and use hip jargon.
How do you feel about theory?I'm not one of those judges that enjoy a theory debate but I'll vote off theory as long as I'm given a clear reason to do so.
I'll pretty much vote on whatever you tell me to vote on. My decisions won't reflect how I personally feel about your arguments (but if you would like to know feel free to ask). I don't like intervening so I won't do it unless I'm forced to. Give me a standard so I know how to evaluate arguments or else I'll have to decide for myself and someone's feelings will get hurt. Tell me which arguments are important and why. Tell me why I should ignore other arguments. I don't like having the feeling that i have to evaluate every argument that was made in order to make my decision. At the very least I'd like to know which arguments I should look to first.
