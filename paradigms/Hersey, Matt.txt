  Experienced CX Judge. Good with speed, but recognize that refutation/argumentation wins the round. Debate is about communication, so if your enunciation and inflection are lost with your speed, you might lose me too. 

LD: Clear value/contention clash. Framework will shape the round and set up voters and impacts. Contentions are important, but unless the impact of a dropped/defeated contention is made clear, it will be difficult to vote on at the end of the round. Kritiks should be clearly explained in framework. 

PF: Clash makes a round enjoyable. Clear impacts and refutation of contentions is necessary, but debaters can't expect to win on defensive arguments. Contention turns are the best offense, and strong case is best to be built on. Clear voters that draw the difference between the two worlds are helpful. 

CX: Coming from the California leagues, I have experience in the National circuit. If you make a good case, I'm liable to follow you - whatever the speed. However, if you fail to explain your impact, you will not win my vote.
