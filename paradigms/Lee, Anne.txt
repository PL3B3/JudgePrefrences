  Hello, my name is Anne Lee.
I am the parent of a sophomore Public Forum debater and I have experience with judging Lincoln-Douglas debate. I hope to see a respectful debate with cohesive and clear arguments made by both sides. I prefer that debaters speak not too slow and not too fast, in order to make it easy to comprehend what each speaker is saying.
