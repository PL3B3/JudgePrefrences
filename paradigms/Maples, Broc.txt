  Experience: I competed in all styles of debate for four years in high school. I also did Parli and LD debate in college for two years. Since then i have coached high school policy and LD debate.
Preferences: I am Tab. You tell me what to do and why I'm doing it and it is my job to follow the orders given to me in the round by the debaters, this has very, very little boundaries. I am very open to new and creative arguments, just explain to me what to do with them and why that wins you the round.

On a more technical basis, very simply, Topicality arguments need voters. Also, i will easily vote on T if the affirmative doesn't win that they are in fact topical. In depth T theory is always welcome on both sides.
K's must have an alternative for me to vote for them.
Speed: On a scale of 1-10, I can handle a good sturdy 8, if you are unclear i will say clear and you should know what to do.
That's it, good luck and ask for more specifics if you need them.
