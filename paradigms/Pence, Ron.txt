I am the father of a state champion Lincoln-Douglas debater.

My paradigms are fairly simple:
I do not prefer speed reading
I will flow, but dropped arguements are not as big of an issue to my person as are other elements of the debate.
Please treat your opponents with respect.
I adhere to LD tradition, and prefer to see Values, Criterions, and overall philosophies upheld throughout the round.
Other than that, I leave creativity up to the debater. Be persuasive, speak clearly, and argue logically.
