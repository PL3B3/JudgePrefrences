I'm tab down to vote for whatever (who doesn't like games?) but you need to hold my hand and make sure I understand your arguments well enough to feel comfortable voting on them. I want to vote to intervene the least. I cannot connect any of the dots for you, so be super clear. Ideally I should be able to explain my decision on the ballot straight from your words.

Don't make assumptions about what I believe about debate outside of what I say on this page. It's your job to tell me how debate works, how your arguments function in the round, how your arguments interact with your opponent's arguments, and why you deserve to win. All arguments should have voters. Tell me why I should care about the words coming out of your mouth.

I don't particularly want to hear debates about why morality subsumes justice or whatever. Since your arguments end up impacting to your value, though, this is definitely a part of the debate that you need to do work on. Just make it, you know, not horrible.

Speed is fine; I'll let you know if you're going too fast for me. I generally find people who say that debate is a persuasive activity to be hilarious.

I like K's and K affs but don't assume that I'm familiar with your arguments about the intersection between Adorno and Deleuze or whatever because I'm not and reading super esoteric critical lit at 300 wpm is a really good way to lose me. Extra hold my hand on these sorts of arguments.

If you look like you're having fun it'll be a lot easier to get me to vote for you. I'm generous with speaks.
