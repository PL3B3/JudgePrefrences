General
I will vote for whatever you present a compelling argument for. I default to an offense/defense paradigm, and ethical confidence on the framework level. I presume that all levels of the debate, e.g. theory, meta-theory, kritiks, contentions, etc. are equally important unless you argue otherwise. I flow cross-ex answers.

Contentions
Weigh everything. I have a high threshold for extensions (i.e. you must re-explain the claim, impact, and warrant). You must explain why you win an argument and why it's a voting issue even if your opponent drops it.

Theory
Theory must include all the elements of a structured shell. You don't have to say "A is the..., B is the..." but you must mention an interpretation, violation, standard, and voter sometime in order for me to vote on the argument. I default to dropping the argument and competing interpretations on the theory debate.

Kritiks
I will act as if I have no knowledge of the authors or literature you reference outside of what you have told me.

Other
Feel free to ask any questions before or after the round. You can contact me at v.a.sinnarkar@berkeley.edu.
