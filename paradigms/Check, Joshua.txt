  Background:
 I competed in LD Debate at Fossil Ridge High School from 2000-2004. I have also judged debate tournaments occasionally since I graduated.
 
Philosophy:
 I am open minded as a judge. I enjoy a variety of styles as long as it is ultimately constructive to the debate. I do, however, think the Value/Value Criterion debate is very important and that all arguments should impact the value criterion. 
 I don’t mind speed as long as it is still understandable. However, I am typically more impressed with fewer arguments that all impact a main theme, than a large quantity of arguments. I am against spreading if it intentionally serves the purpose to exploit or disadvantage the opponent. Communicating with your opponent and judge on issues such as speed before the round never hurts.
 The debater should tell me which arguments should be weighed as most important so I don’t have to intervene.
