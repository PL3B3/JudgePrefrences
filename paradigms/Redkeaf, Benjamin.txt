  I debated a lot in high school in Minnesota. I qualified for NFL's nationals, qualified for the state tournament, and debated around the country. I decided to start judging because I missed the activity. I'm currently a 3L at SMU.

So I would describe my Judge philosophy as "game player". Basically, I think that debate is a game. It involves teams making strategic choices and reacting to their opponentâ€™s choices. Thus if you do a good job making, recognizing, and taking advantage of these choices you will get higher speaker points. I don't think there is anything not allowed in the game per se, but if you think the other team has made the game unfair tell me why and why I should vote on it and if you win the argument I will. Finally, the game is played between the teams but the score is kept on my flow. If I can't flow you I can't score you. I don't have a problem with speed but be clear between tag and evidence and sign post.

Some miscellaneous things: 1) I'm a stickler on prep time mainly because I feel time pressure is part of the game. Also I like my rounds to finish close to on time. So if you say end prep I expect a road map and for you to start speaking. I don't give you extra time to "flash" your speech to the other team either do this during your prep, have your partner do it, or give it to them after your speech. If you are out of prep time your speech time begins 2) Speaker points, the default number for me is 25. Everyone gets a 25 provided they are not rude/racist/or otherwise inappropriate. If you are what I consider a really good debater (make strong arguments, sign post, speak clearly, ect) you will get a 28. To get a 29 or 30 you have to do something amazing or impressive like be funny, clever, or extremely entertaining. 3) I don't mind open cross-x but know it hurts your speaker points and makes your team look bad if you are answering for your partner all the time.

Anything else just ask.
