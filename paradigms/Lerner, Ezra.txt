So I really valued judges who were non-intrusive in high school and allowed a lot of evidence spoken quickly. To the best of my capabilities, I try to do the same with a few exceptions. 

1. My flowing capabilities are not as good as I would like them to be, so if you blip through something the first time and I can't flow it, I can't vote on it. This is a rarity, especially in PF, and I try my best to get everything, but it does happen, so please be aware. 

2. If you use a card in the first speeches, you have to tell me where it is from during the later speeches. You cannot just recite the statistic, because you are asking me to remember whether or not it has been mentioned before, and during what speech. If you do not recite the tag, I will drop the card. (Side Note: You may wonder why I don't go look back on the flow. If I do that, I am missing a lot more of your speech than I am gaining, which is not good for anyone. 

3. If the accuracy of a card is disputed, and its a big deal, I will likely call for it. If a major point of the debate comes down to competing cards, and there isn't exponentially better weighing done one side, I will likely call for it. 

4. I really regret being so mean in high-school crossfires, but because I did do it, I will allow you to get pretty forward. However, if one person looks visibly upset, stop, or I will tank your speaks.
