  I am currently a UC Berkeley senior and debated LD 3 years in high school. I went to nats in 2008 and was state runner-up. 

I like to see emphasis on value and criterion. If you are using philosophy, be able to explain it and defend it. I enjoy CX but don't flow it. I also enjoy direct clash and logical arguments. Finish with your voters and tell me exactly why I should vote for you. 

I don't like to see counterplans or theory. Speed is fine, but slow down on taglines so I can right them down and please sign post. Have fun! :)
