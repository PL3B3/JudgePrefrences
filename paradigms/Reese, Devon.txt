  High school and college policy debater. Participated in, coached or judged 10,000+ rounds. Lawyer too. I have no axe to grind and am open minded about different styles of debate. I am a gay progressive democrat. I vote based on who did the best job of debating in the round. I can handle any level of speed.
Advice for debaters I judge:
-If you are a kritikal or performance team, that's great and I am all for that, but explain the K without just throwing around "buzz words". I have a hard time understanding teams that run Neolib/Cap with a Spending DA (?). This does not make a lot of sense to me and I can be persuaded to vote on the contradiction.
-Don't be a robot: i.e. don't just read massive blocks and overviews at me. Minor cloud clash and grouping the debate is fine, but I want to see line-by-line clash.
-Things I am unlikely to vote for: Inherency, "must disclose", "speed kills", claims without warrants, poorly debated T violations, "mutiple perms are bad".
-0.5+ bonus speaker points for any references you make to "Mean Girls".
Speaker points: 29+ is excellent, 29-28 is really good, 28-27 is decent, 27-26 suggests you need a lot of work, and below 26 is a punishment for something inappropriate or offensive. Have fun with the debate and be kind.
