  I am a former high school debater who debated for LC Anderson High School in Austin, TX. While I do focus on the flow, it is important that debaters don't simply extend arguments and say their opponent dropped an argument but instead tell me why that is important and what that implication is. I don't care about definitions unless there is something that is really important to define to clarify the round. I think it is okay if both debaters agree upon values but if they are arguing different values, it is important to me that they both clearly say why their value is superior and also how their criterion/standard gets them there better. I do appreciate voters and crystillazition of the round.

As far as speaking goes, it is very important that speakers are clear, especailly in their constructions. I can handle speed to an extent but prefer that it is used only as necessary and also with great clarity. I dont like speed with the constant breaths as I dont think it is conducive to being a good debater.
