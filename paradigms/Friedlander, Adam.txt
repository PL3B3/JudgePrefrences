  Background
From 2005-2009 I was on the Hendrick Hudson High School Debate Team under Jim Menick. During that time I did a combination of LD and PF, mainly focusing on the PF side during my last two years of debate. I am currently attending American University in DC.

Paradigm
When judging a PF round I look for who has won the different arguments in the round and how much each of those arguments plays into the overall debate. This means that just because a team wins the most arguments in the round, they are not assured to win my ballot because the arguments that their opponents may have won may weigh more heavily in the round. So, I encourage all debaters to not only win the points that they are making, but to show me why the arguments they are winning are important in the scope of the round, and why the arguments their opponents may be winning are not.

Overall, I believe that debates should be civil. Debates should not be rude to their opponents: i.e. talking loudly during their opponents speeches, calling each others arguments "stupid," or just being completely condescending to a point where you are just making personal attacks against your opponents. This is not to say that debaters can't raise their voice or get enthusiastic about an argument, its that there is a fine line between that and being rude.
