  I am not a very experienced judge. My daughter is a first year LD competitor. My daughter's coach has gone over how to judge an LD debate and I will make my decision based on who better upholds his or her value and side in the resolution. Arguments need to be explicitly linked to value. I prefer voting issues in the last speeches than a line-by-line refutation. I will not take notes if you spread.
