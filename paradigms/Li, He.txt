  I am currently a sophomore at Yale University. I have judged in the BQCFL, and a few national circuit tournaments.

Traditional vs. National Circuit: I don't like the term "lay judge", but I think most national circuit debaters would categorize me that way.

Jargon: I don't know a lot of technical debate terminology, so I find myself voting down a lot of debaters who use it as a shorthand without really explaining things. Please explain and over-explain everything.

Speed: Spreaders are at a disadvantage with me. Just don't do it. It harms the activity, and I don't find any benefit to it at all. 

Theory: You can let me know if there is something VERY abusive happening in the round, but I'd rather we keep the debate focused on the given resolution. 

Extra: I am very big on the values debate. Be sure to sign-post. Have fun.
