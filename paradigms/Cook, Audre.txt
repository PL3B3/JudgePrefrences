  Just because I'm a mom doesn't mean I'm a mommy judge

I am very familiar with the specific technicalities and nuances of LD, and I am well aware of how to properly evaluate a round. The 2014-2015 season will be my third year of judging LD. I have judged everywhere, from locals to state championships, invitationals, and national championships

Think of me as a traditional/flow hybrid judge. I want you to legitimately try to be convincing and I find perception and delivery to be very important, so don't spread and please stand during your speeches but I will also know which things can easily win or lose you the round, like dropped arguments or clean extensions.

Keep policy tactics out of the round ie Speed, Plans, CP's, Disads, and the like

Please don't run theory. I know a legitimately abusive argument when I hear one and I don't need you trying to enforce frivolous rules like AFC

Please don't run K's. I want to hear a debate on the topic

It's really annoying when debaters try to skew their opponent's cases to make it sound like they're racist, sexist, etc. Don't do that.

Please don't say "you vote aff/neg because..." or "i'm winning because..." I want you to persuade me, not tell me what to think.

I shouldn't have to even say this, but don't be a jerk to your opponent. There's a difference between being assertive and being just plain rude, and I hope you know where to draw the line

I will drop you immediately if you do anything I have asked you not to do. I view it as extremely disrespectful and poor sportsmanship

Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions!
