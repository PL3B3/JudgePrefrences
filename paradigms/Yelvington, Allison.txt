Background: 4 years of LD at Dulles HS- mostly locals. Went to TFA State twice, TDC twice. 
 Speed: 
-I can flow spreading but would prefer you keep it moderate paced (talk fast but don’t full on spread). 
-Slow down on author names. 
-Please try your best to make the round accessible to your opponent
 General:
-I will vote on any argument if you explain it clearly to me, warrant and impact it. 
-Not a big fan of dense philosophy framework debates but as long as you slow down and explain it to me I’ll vote on it.
-Not a fan of skep/presumption/tricky spikes
-Policy arguments are fine. 
-Ks are fine. 
-Just explain, don’t presume I know anything.
-Give me voting issues in your last speech.

Extensions: Extend the warrants not just the card names.

 Speaks: have an efficient strat, present yourself well, be nice to each other.

Theory: Default competing interps. Slow down for theory arguments. Same as everything else, I’ll vote on anything if you persuade me.

Other: 
-feel free to ask me if you have further questions
-flashing isn’t prep, just don’t dawdle 
-please do not use derogatory or exclusionary language
