  As debate is, first and foremost, a communications event, I detest spreading or any speed reading of plans, cases, cards or anything else. If it is too fast for me to flow, you will not be credited with making the point.

I do not like to see abusive definitions, which include definitions that go against common sense, such as "reduction" does not include "elimination", which is, after all, reduction to zero.

I like to see a clash on the issues brought up in the debate and not preplanned arguments that are not relevant to the debate as presented by the pro/aff.

I do not appreciate sarcasm directed to your opponents and prefer disagreeing without being disagreeable.

I prefer to write all comments on the ballot and not disclose or comment immediately after a debate.
