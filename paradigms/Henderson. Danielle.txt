  I am currently a debater for Illinois College. I’m not going to write out my preferences for each argument because, honestly, I don’t care what you run as long as you do it well. I will say, if you run a K, don’t assume I know your literature and be prepared to explain it. 

Evidence: Please include me in your email chain (henderson.danielle@mail.ic.edu), flashdrive circle, or whatever it is you do. Sometimes I have trouble processing information that is presented too quickly so the best way for me to make sure I get everything on my flow is to have the doc in front of me. 

Speed: Speed does you no good if no one can understand you. 

Prep time: Don’t steal it. Sending out the document does not count against your prep time, but if I catch you stealing prep time, you will lose speaker points. If I see it, I will call you out. You will get one warning and after that I will take off speaker points. 

Time: I will usually have a timer running during prep and speeches, but you should get in the habit of timing yourself. 

Also, respect everyone in the room including your partner. If you say something racist, sexist, homophobic, or ableist and your opponent calls you out, you will, at the very least, lose speaker points.
