While it's still true I don't know anything about the [x] topic, I don't think I qualify as a "k hack".

T, DAs, CPs, Ks/K affs ('normal', performance or otherwise) are all fine. I don't judge a lot so I haven't thought much about/been made aware of biases I might have but I've defended most categories of arguments.

I have a very (very) basic grasp of most K literature but anything deeper than the wikipedia page (and even the longer one's still confuse me) will probably require some explanation.
