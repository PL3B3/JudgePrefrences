  My name is Albert Wu, and I have extensive high school experience in LD and college experience in parliamentary debate.

I have judged off and on since 2001, and I am primarily a flow judge.

I will flow everything said in the round, and speed is not an issue, though I prefer concise, carefully articulated arguments and speaking. If I do not understand you, I will not flow it, and it will process into my brain for the round.

I am fine with kritiks and other such methods, but make sure you defend your methods, and not just use it for round purposes.

I do not orally disclose, but instead post comments on the ballot.

Speaker points are based entirely on your speaking style. You can lose the round with max speaker points, but these two usually do not coincide. To summarize, I vote off the flow, and any voting issues you give should be based on what I have written on the flow.
