  Dick Stein's LD Paradigm:

I am a former PF debater from Timber Creek High school. I am in my second year at the University of Central Florida majoring in Finance. 

I'm fair, open to arguments and willing to give everyone the chance they deserve. I judge quality over quantity so please if you spread, make sure that I am able to understand what you are saying. 

I'm pretty relaxed and just want to have fun so don't feel stressed out. The better debater will win. 

Good Luck!
