  Name: Mohan Sayani
Affiliation: DVHS San Ramon
Skill Level: Parent Judge

My experience with judging has been at my son's events. Judged around 15 rounds at Novice, JV and Varsity levels.
I prefer to vote on arguments that are topical, clear, impacted to a standard, and weighed against other offense in the round. 

I prefer topical substantive debate over purely technical moves. 
Speaker Points:
Solely on speaking clarity and style( Don't spread). My win/loss decision is based on who demonstrates a clear and compelling case for affirming or negating the resolution through argumentation regardless of fluency and beauty of speech, so I do award low-point wins from time to time. My average is a 28 but the range is 26-30.
