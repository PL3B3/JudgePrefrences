Marjorie Lininger is a retired principal and teacher who worked at several schools, including Ashland Junior High School, Hedrick Middle School, and South Medford High School.

She does not have much experience judging high school debate, but she used to teach speech at Ashland Junior High School, and she competed in speech and debate when she was a high school student herself.

She is smart, familiar with current events, and careful to listen to all sides before making a decision. 

To maximize your odds of succeeding when you argue in front of this judge, you should do the following: speak at a comprehensible pace, provide plain labels for your arguments, clash as much as possible with your opponent, behave civilly, and weigh the debate in later speeches. Use all your time, but don't repeat yourself. Avoid jargon that is unique to the debate world. Provide an off-time roadmap if possible.

If you have questions about this judge's presences, feel free to ask before the round starts.
