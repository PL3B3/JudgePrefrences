I debated for 3 years at Byron Nelson HS.

TL;DR: I'm an blank slate with conditions. Absent another framework, I default policymaker via the biggest post-fiat utilitarian impacts.

Arguments I will not vote on
SkepFrivolous theoryXenophobic arguments (racism/sexism good, etc.)Potential abuse
Arguments I am ideologically inclined towards, but can be persuaded otherwise
Cap/neolib/state badFiat solves the link to PTXCyclical or structural impacts outweigh extinction scenarios on probability.Negative gets 1-2 conditional advocacies.Reasonability over competing interpsDisclosure good
Miscellaneous
I have a high threshold for abuse claims.Speed isn't a problem, but clarity matters. Taglines, T/theory debate, perms and advocacy texts need to be slower and emphasized.I will yell "clear" but I will not strain myself to hear your arguments.Cross-X is binding. I will pay attention but I will not flow it.Flex prep and open cross-x are fine.I will always disclose the decision and RFD but not speaks.You must provide a means for you opponent to view the speech doc if requested, even if this is at your expense.I am understanding of technology issues with paperless debate, but I won't tolerate any ethics violations involving the internet or formatting.Flashing won't be counted towards prep as long as you don't abuse it.I will keep time but I expect debaters to do the same.I interpret conditionality as permitting multiple advocacies, not permitting performance contradictions.
Feel free to ask me any other questions about my paradigm before the round begins.
