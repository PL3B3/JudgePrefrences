  I debated for four years for Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD and graduated in 2012. I qualified to the TOC my sophomore through senior years. I'm currently a junior at Harvard.

I’m not very opinionated about debate and will try my best to evaluate the round based on any and all arguments the debaters make. That said, a few things:
- I don’t like disclosure theory, or any other argument that brings a “political” issue in the debate community into the round. I won’t reject these arguments on face, but I’ll probably want to.
- I don’t think it makes sense to win off an “offensive counter-interpretation” to theory absent some sort of justification for an RVI.
- I will like you better and give you better speaks if I can tell that you’re thinking on your feet in round. Similarly, make sure what you’re reading actually applies and explain applications of things in your own words.
