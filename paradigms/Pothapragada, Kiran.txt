  Short Version: I am a traditional judge that’s fairly new to the activity. I looked to persuasion
over technical debate. Do not pref me very high if you want a circuit, progressive, policy type round.


Long version: I’m not likely to vote strictly off the flow. To quote Steven Tomasi “Just because
Aff dropped the #2 on the standard doesn't mean I give it any more credence than a better
explained and more persuasive argument.” I look for persuasion, and this means good slow
crystallization and coherency; write the ballot for me.
No speed or jargon. I expect a traditional Value/Value criterion structure. I strongly discourage
running extremely technical or dense arguments in front of me. If you still feel like you HAVE
to run arguments like this, explain them as if you were talking to someone with no debate
experience. For example, don’t spread a theory shell saying “a is the interp, b is the violation
etc...” Avoid using the jargon and speed, and just explain each step logically. Similarly, just
reading Foucault and using the word biopower in a K will not work; explain the whole argument
free of jargon/buzz words.
