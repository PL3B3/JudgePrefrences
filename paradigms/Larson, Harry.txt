  Experience: I used to compete on the New York local circuit in high school.

Criteria for judging: I like to think about the debate round as a whole, rather than its parts. I don't care if your opponent drops a single argument and you extend it if you are not winning holistically. I don't have much experience with a prioris, counterplans, and other policy-esque off-cases, so please don't run those unless you explain VERY clearly how they fit into the round and why I should care about them. Also, keep in mind that I have a much higher standard for these types of arguments than conventional LD arguments. I tend to appreciate real-life and public policy examples.

Speed: I enjoy the rhetorical aspects of LD Debate, and I don't think these should be ruined by excessive speed, even at the risk of losing a few arguments. If you talk faster than I can take notes, that probably won't be good for you.
