  Policy args are chill too. 



Should affs be topical?

 Debated for four years in high school.

- Generic process counterplans are for bad debaters.

- When I was younger, I used to ride my bike without a helmet, but then one day I fell and starting bleeding. 

- I am a young judge so I can’t be exactly sure what all of my specific preferences are – everything below this bullet point is just an educated guess on how I will judge your debate.

- I judge debates very technically. However, don't be surprised if I find a bad theory argument (like generic PICs bad) less convincing.
- German battleships in World War II were usually named after famous military leaders from their history. 
- I will vote for almost anything. Getting offended at the stupidity/edginess of your opponent’s argument is not a counter-argument on its own. Rather, make actual counter-arguments and then use your emotions to be more persuasive. That being said, remember that debate isn’t just your playground, it is also coaches’ workspace and career. Please respect that. If you want to use a debate round to discuss the intricacies of your masturbation techniques, don’t. You aren’t funny or cool.
- On tech vs. truth, I think debate is about persuasion rather than truth-seeking. However, “true” arguments tend to sound more persuasive. This probably has something to do with the previous bullet point.
- I will vote on intrinsicness vs. a politics DA.
- I usually default to competing interpretations, but sometimes, I don’t. 
Speaker Points: Well-researched strategies and persuasive speaking styles (voice inflection, eye contact, etc.) will boost your points.
Evidence or analytics, it needs a claim and reasons why that claim is true.

Try to make the K seem as relevant as possible and not jargon-filled hippie crap. If you go for the K a lot, you have probably figured out that this has less to do with what K you run, and more with how you explain it.
A good K debate is more interesting than a good policy debate, but a bad K debate can be seizure inducing. If you plan on winning on your K by hiding some idiotic trick in the middle of an incoherent 2NC overview, just… stop.
One last thing, if you understand how framework actually functions in a round when the neg goes for a K and the aff defends the plan, you will probably win. I am willing ignore the effects of the plan and make the debate about the 1AC’s language/ontology/etc.

Has the activity really come to this?
