My thoughts on debate: -Ask for pronouns-Debate is shitty a lot. People read arguments they don't understand. People are mean and overly competitive. People win by confusing their opponent. People win by spreading out their opponent. Please make debate a better activity and don't engage in these behaviors. I will do everything I can to justify a ballot for a debater who isn't do this stuff if they are debating someone who is. This will also be reflected heavily in speaks.-I can flow speed and spread when I was in hs but spreading is really bad and nobody actually understands what's going on. If I don't know what [insert favorite pretentious philosopher] is saying after I've closely and slowly read through it three times, I'm not gonna understand it at 450 wpm. Please don't spread. You probably will anyway. I did when I was in hs and saw paradigms like this. If you do I will still evaluate your arguments and will still pick you up if you're up on the flow but please don't spread.-Music in debate rounds is cool-Arguments about religion are cool. -Analytic philosophy is fake philosophy-If your opponent requests you not to spread or not to read overly complicate nat circuit stuff, please comply. This doesn't mean that you have to read a lay case with V+VC structure, but you need to read your stuff in an accessible manner. You should be able to explain whatever K you're reading to somebody who doesn't have experience with critical lit, otherwise you don't understand your own argument well enough and probably shouldn't be reading it at all. -Long link chains with tenuous connections are bad arguments.-I can't flow blippy theory arguments.
