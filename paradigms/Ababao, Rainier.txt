(created for the Churchill debate tournament - 1/9/15)
My name is Rainier Ababao and I am a second year student at UT Austin.

I did LD debate at Stony Point HS in the Austin area for three years, had a winning prelim record at TFA State, and competed at NFL Nationals. I was a lab instructor at the UTNIF debate camp and an assistant coach for Salado HS. I ran truth-testy affs with lots of spikes and preemptive theory/"triggers", critical affs, plan affs, DA/CPs, skep-like/grammar-centered neg positions, T, theory, K's, etc. But I have no preference for any style of debate, whether it be "traditional" or "progressive".

Speed - OK as long as you slow down on tags and author names if you use them to signpost. Please slow down on stuff like theory interps and plan texts. I will say clear once or twice because I want to understand your argument as best I can.

CX/flex prep - As long as your opponent is fine with it.

Theory - Will always be evaluated. I probably lean slightly towards reasonability. Tell me what to do with theory (drop arg or debater) or I default to dropping the argument. By default, I would probably evaluate theory as another way to filter offense.

Prestandards/a-priori arguments/skep triggers - Need to be explicit in the first speech that the argument is being made. Not opposed to smart ones, but if they're just blippy/blatantly untrue then my threshold for what counts a sufficient response to them will be dramatically lower than other arguments.

Policy arguments - Fine if you can run them well.

Kritiks/critical literature - Don't know anything outside of the typical debate use case. Slowing down on the important parts would make my day.

Micropolitics/role of the ballot/discourse/performance - No preference for or against these types of advocacies. You need to explain and win why your position operates on a pre-fiat level.

Speaker Points - Based on the tournament and how far I think you deserve to make it, as per your performance in the round.

Note - The best debaters take the time to weigh/establish an impact calculus/crystallize. I will vote for the debater who wins the important arguments, not the debater who wins the most arguments.

Anything else - please feel free to ask me.
