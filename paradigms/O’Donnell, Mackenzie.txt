  Hi! I’m just out of high school and I did three years of varsity debate. I did circuit debate my last year. I’d prefer if you read plan texts. I appreciate framing in debates if you want me to evaluate something I’m not familiar with. For example, I am not familiar with kritiks on this topic so framing would be appreciated. I think clipping is unfair and I will stop the debate if it is happening. I evaluate the debate through impact calc but I am willing to listen to the way in which you want to be debating. I evaluate Topicality through competing interpretations — please explain your impacts to topicality sufficiently. I am willing to read some cards but I should not be in the position to read more than a couple.
