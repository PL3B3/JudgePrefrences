  Comfortable with speed, but enunciation should also be there; I'll clear you if necessary. Down with pretty much any theory. Comfortable with almost all Kritiks, I don't need a lot of the context for basic Kritiks but if you're running something super out-there provide me with a thesis. In terms of topical debate, I enjoy strong disadvantages, and the link story should be clear. In terms of impacts and impact weighing, I have no preference for magnitude or probability (meaning it's your responsibility to explain why I should care about one over the other).
