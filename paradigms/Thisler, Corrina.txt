I'm a sister to an LD debater who has been competing for 3 years. I have judged IE, PF, LD, but mostly LD and PF. 

I can't handle fast speed so please do not spread.

 I will still however take rigorous notes of the round and adjudicate from there. 

For me, presentation and argumentation go hand in hand, so try to incorporate both in your strategy to get my ballot. Also, lots of weighing and crystallization will help you get my ballot. Good luck to all those competing, and if you have any further questions you can ask me before the round.
