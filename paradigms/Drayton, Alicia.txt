  I am a first year judge and a former debate competitor within the Florida Gulf Coast region. I guess I can be labeled a "lay" judge for the sake of simplicity but I am experienced in debate. Since I mainly competed in Lincoln-Douglas I will give a paradigm for this event first. 

I prefer the classic and traditional approach to Lincoln-Douglas opposed to the more progressive style that is Policy influenced. I do not care for spreading, theory, or any Policy oriented argument tactics. I prefer value centered debate that focuses on upholding a particular paradigm or philosophy. I am hard on drops, and I don't appreciate half ass arguments of why an argument isn't dropped when in fact you actually dropped that shit. I expect developed and intricate arguments for this event that revolves around a comprehensible value structure. 

I am very liberal when it comes to Public Forum Debate. Since it was specifically created to be understood by the average citizen I do expect developed arguments delivered in a rather simplistic manner to honor this notion. 

I also do not care for debate jargon for either event. Although LD is supposedly more complex than PF that requires experienced judges, it is obvious it will not always be the case. Debate is meant to educate the competitors and the judge, and the style of the debate ought to be presented in a manner which can umbrella the capacities of all judges; not just the experienced ones. 

So in short; don't spread, don't drop, don't suck.
