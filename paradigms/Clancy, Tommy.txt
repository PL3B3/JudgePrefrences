My default is to evaluate the round based on a standard and then those arguments which are explicitly linked back to the established standard. Any prestandards arguments need to be well warranted as to why they are prestandard. I also hold theory to a high burden of proof. In-round abuse generally must be shown. I’m fine with speed though only encourage it if it’s clear and used to make more in depth argumentation. In terms of battling framework extensions, I’ll defer to the aff. If I don’t understand an argument the first time it’s articulated I won’t vote on it. If you are excessively mean, I might vote against you.
