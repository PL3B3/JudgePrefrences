  UPDATED PARADIGM

Name: Brian Wiora
Affiliation: Greenhill School

General:

I won’t vote on arguments that I don’t understand or that don’t have warrants (half-sentence spikes, hidden triggers, vague/unjustified claims, etc.).

I prefer to see debates about the topic and find tricks to avoid clash, multiple theory shells, and pre-fiat arguments unpersuasive. I also like good framework debates.

Speed:

Speed is not an issue if you are clear.


If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate asking!
