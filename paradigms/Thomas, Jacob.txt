  I am the debate coach at Newtown High School in Newtown, CT.

1. Speed. I can handle most speed. There is, however, such a thing as going too fast. If I can't understand you, I won't flow you. If speed dectracts from clarity, I won't flow you.

2. Theory. As with most people who posted philosophies, I am not necessarily a fan. There is a need for it when abuse is clear. However, theory to avoid addressing a case is boring and I will probably ignore it. Please argue the resolution on its merits. With that being said, if someone runs theory, I am certainly open to RVIs.

3. Civility. Don't be a jerk. Period.

4. Value Structure. I have no problems with util, consequentialism, etc. Have a reason for why I should use your value over your opponent's. 

I'm open to most other things. 

I will try to give you oral criticism if time allows. If not, please find me afterwards and we can talk.
