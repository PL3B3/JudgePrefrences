  I am a lay judge who was been judging mostly LD since my high school daughter began competing in 2011. I have never debated and I take LD ballots every chance I get.

I really don't appreciate speed. Please slow down for tags of cards. Especially slow down when you are labeling a sub point observation, contention etc. Make this as easy for me to flow as possible. I understand a lot of you came to a tournament prepared to speed, but I cannot judge if I do not understand you.
 
Luckily though, I am not biased and I am open minded to any arguments. But in order for me to buy an argument, it needs to make sense to me. To me, I am not looking to the number of arguments you make but I believe some arguments hold more value than others. So when explaining or extending a point, explain its importance. 
 
 It's not in your favor to tell me how the scoring will be, I decide how to evaluate the arguments. I'm not stupid, so don't waste time tell the judge to "sign the ballot" on a bunch of points. So, clear extensions in your last speech I like. Be clear about where a turn is being put on, and make sure your turn is actually turning the argument. 
 
I am not familiar with most fancy frameworks. I have experience with util and basic Kant/deont. I am open to basic theory shells when there is an actual problem in the round. Just make sure your theory isn't BS, it will not be in your favor if it is. Only run theory when necessary, and try not to be overly abusive.
