Speed- I would REALLY rather you didn't, but I can keep up just fine if that's your style. Although, speed can be okay if you enunciate correctly and control your volume. If at any point I can't understand what you're saying, it likely won't go on my flow. Having a "slow", well developed argument will be more persuasive on my ballot. 
Aff- Traditional Affs are okay, K Affs are okay, do your thing. When in doubt, case outweighs if you tell me it does. 
Neg- I give equal weight to all forms of argument- T, K, DA, CP- run whatever you want, and I'll evaluate it equally. 
Not a mega fan of excessive conditionality, i.e. if you run 7 off and kick out of 6 in the last speech, it's probably abusive. 
Whatever you choose to run, articulate it well. Other than that, I don't have any particular preferences. 
Have fun.
