Hi! I'm a graduate from Lexington High School where I debated LD for four years. You can run whatever you want, but make sure your arguments have clear warrants and implications, and explain how your arguments interact with the other arguments in the round, because no one likes judge intervention (least of all your judges.) 

If you have any questions please ask me before the round (:
