Acorn Community High School '16
CSU '20

Background- 4 years HS Policy Debate. Consider myself a "K"/performance debater.

T- I'm down for T. Need specifics of abuse that catalyzed said T

C/P- Explain net benefit, that actually functions.

D/A- I'm down for them only if there is good impact calc (obviously)

K- Run'em, I'm down for majority of them, just need to see alt solvency. If you plan to kick the alt then refer back to D/A section.

"Performance"- All for it. I would like to know the significance of said performance and why it is apart of your route to the ballot.

As you can see I'm generally down for anything as long as its clear and functional. Do the best you can do.
