  Hi my name is Carly Moore, I'm a 4th year debater at Houston County High School.

I hate patriarchy and western politics. I'm really well versed in K literature, but that doesn't mean I will vote on every K. I vote for good arguments. Zizek is a bad argument. 

If God exists she's probably some conglomeration of Beyonce and Judith Butler. 
Also I like contemporary classical music and Beyonce.
