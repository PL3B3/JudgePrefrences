  I debated for Rancho Bernardo HS for a few years and did a few rounds, and I got to state quals and won a round once so I guess you could say I know a little something about debate.

I believe that debate is a sport that all people should do, unless your a tool. If you want me to understand you're args (call them ponies for me please), you should be clear and stuff or I'll nuke your speaks (trust me I know what that means, Im smart).
If I say "HUhhhn ??(c)" You're on the right track. You can run any argument at me (but dont run AT me, or I might defend myself), but I'm really fond of Ks, especially Fem Ks, because I feel like there should be a lot of that in debate.

The person who better deconstructs debate in my opinion gets massive bonus points in my book. But don't like break you're laptop or anything because then your stupid. (dont wory though it doesn't happen that often) Unfortunately I have a condition where I can only understand English when it's spoken in an Indian accent. Please don't mock my condition. Also, I self-identify as a turtle and you should respect my decision.

Also I'll give you a massive speak hike if you can reference One Direction three times during the round applicably. <3 Zayn ;(
Ill automatically give u max speaks if you can incorporate a pick up line that rustles my jimmies

And since I know that reading a paradigm to know your judge means getting a holistic picture, here are the results from an internet quiz that I took. It's so me :D :https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t34.0-12/12312518_1012637232129911_247733942_n.jpg?oh=544220793a1a927e19ff810054e11c64&oe=565B1C2A

Also a picture of my beautiful face so you know there isn't an imposter from the illuminati (srs though):

I'm a virgo if that helps.
