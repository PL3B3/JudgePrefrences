  I debated for 3 years at Ankeny High School in Iowa. Since graduating high school in 2005, I have judged a decent amount of debate. I have judged every kind of debate, including speech events. I graduated from the University of Iowa with a BA in political science and minors in English and international studies.

When judging rounds, I try to go into every round with an open mind and let the debaters do what they want. There is nothing I won't listen to or take into evaluating the round. That being said, some theory and critical arguments need to be thoroughly explained for me. It is probably a good idea for you to slow down a bit, especially for tags with these kinds of arguments. I won't pull cards after the round. I think it is the job of the debaters to communicate the arguments, and I judge them based on that. I don't think it's my job as the judge to read the evidence they did a bad job at communicating. 

Feel free to ask me any questions you might have before the round. I might be able to answer them.
