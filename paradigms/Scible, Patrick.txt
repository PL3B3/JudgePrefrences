This is my second year coaching policy debate at the high school level and I am open to a variety of debate styles. My paradigm could be defined as Tabula Rasa. Affirmatives and negatives should make it clear how the debate should be judged during their rebuttals. I prefer open cross-x as long as it remains civil (questions and answers only). Make sure that not one person is dominating the cross-x. Speed debating is acceptable, but I will require clear tags and signposting during the debate. I am an average flow, but I will ask for clarification on a tag if it is spoken too fast. I do not want to hinder the abilities of the debater so I will not require slow card reading. As far as negative arguments, I do ask for clear links for disads and kritiks. In order for me to vote on the K, the negative must be able to defend the alternative. If you are defending framework, you must be able to clearly identify and defend this as well. The 2AR and 2NR should be your time to express how I should judge the debate. Crystallize your arguments at this time. I prefer hearing a clear impact calculus in these speeches that will help me weigh the round. Most importantly, be POLITE and have fun.
