  I am the judge for St. Agnes CD. I have judged on the Houston local circuit a bit for 2 years for my daughter's team.

I am open to hearing any type of argumentation, preferably traditional, but persuasion is the most important part of debate to me. I don't want to sit in a round where you are speaking too quickly. Persuade me to vote for you. If you spread, and I can't tell what you're saying, your speaks will suffer. This also means that if your argument is not clear, I will not vote for you. I prefer that you have your cases printed. If not, please flash me your cases. Respecting your opponent is also big for me. Don't be rude in round, please. I know you all work so hard, and I look forward to watching you debate!
