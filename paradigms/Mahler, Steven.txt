Judge Philosophy (as of NAUDL Nationals 2016)

My judging experience began with my son's debate career. Instead of just observing debate I volunteered to judge. It has been great to share in his interest and this has given me an understanding of his sometimes frustration with judges.

The clearer and more concise your presentation and arguments are the easier it is for my decision. Spreading is ok but must be clear and understandable. Too fast leads to no note-taking or flowing for me.

Too many cards will just confuse your presentation. Quality not quantity.

I will be flexible judge and not always cut you off just because a timer sounds. 
Good sportsmanship and making sure everyone is ready for your speech are things I insist upon.

Best of luck to all.
