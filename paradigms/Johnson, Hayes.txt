  Not a big fan of the T debate unless it seems very necessary. K's are ok as long as the framework is articulated and linked thoroughly. If a K is ran, try ro have disads or other offense as well. Generally the team that wins line by line on the flow will win the round. It is preferred that teams slow down for taglines and say them clearly.
