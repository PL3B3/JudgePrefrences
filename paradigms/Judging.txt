  My name is Kyair Butts and I did 4 years of high school debate and currently am the President of the Drake Mock Trial team. I coach high school debate and high school mock trial. In terms of debate, I like pragmatic arguments and a rational explanation of the contentions that are being presented. Topicality is key for me and having links that make sense and that are easy to follow. I think that the "what" you say is important, but "how" you say it affects your style points with me. I've been judging since I graduated, so the last 3 years and have covered a wide variety of types of debate and IE's too.
