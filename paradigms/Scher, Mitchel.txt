I reach my decision by using impacts to a value criterion unless I’m told not to. However, I prefer that there be some sort of weighing mechanism. I want you to try and resolve the criterion debate so I don’t have to. Afterwards, impact, and weigh to it. If you can weigh and make your voting issues clear, it makes my job easier, and better allows me to make a decision. I’m not going to vote off any underdeveloped arguments.

I flow and evaluate the debate based on what I have flowed. I’m able to understand speed, but don’t go fast for the sake of going fast, and don’t take the fact that I understand speed as the go-ahead to be unclear and read every single piece of paper you brought to the tournament. You’ll probably be able to tell if I can’t understand you, but the clearer you are, the better. If I don’t have it flowed, I’m not going to vote on it. The more signposting you do, the better.

I don’t like theory, and it is not in your best interest to run it. The same applies for kritiks and “critical” positions.
