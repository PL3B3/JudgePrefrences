  I am currently a high school debate coach and my students specialize in LD.
I believe my job as a judge is to adapt to the ideas and styles of the debaters.
I was a policy debater in high school and college.
My CX background as a 2nd neg endears me to weighing impacts on both sides.
I like a blend of theory and pragmatic application.
I believe a clear value and criterion are important in evaluating the round.
Either a holistic view of the issues or line-by-line are acceptable.
Crystallize in rebuttals and give me voters.
I am impressed with direct clash, synthesis of arguments, and debaters that draw logical conclusions.
I think conditional arguments are abusive. If you run it, defend it.
I will vote for creative theories established with framework.
Counterplans have no place in LD.
Use CX time to set up arguments or to clarify positions.
Speed is not an issue as long as the speaker is clear and organized.
I keep a rigorous flow.
