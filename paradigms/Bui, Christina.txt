I'm familiar with all types of debate, do what you do best and makes you most comfortable and have fun with it. 

K Affs: I enjoy listening to these, but they must be tied to the topic and have a method that is clearly defended throughout the round. 

Kritiks: The alternative is usually the weakest part of the K, it frustrates me to no end when teams don't explain them well. Instead of reading disads to the perm for an entire 5 min, explain the alt beyond a 30 sec extension of your mediocre alt card. Specific links to the aff are necessary. External impacts are needed to beat a persuasive 2AR case debate. A good K debate makes me soooo happy.
Counterplans: They're ok but must be clearly competitive. PICs are better.
Disads: Up-to-date, strong, and specific evidence. Impact calc is key, evidence comparison is great.
Topicality: Generally I default to competing interpretations unless given strong reasons otherwise. Both teams need explanations as to why their interp is better for the topic. Case lists are important.
Framework: More fun than T. A strong TVA is necessary. More compelled to vote on decision making, TVA, SSD, or argument testing than fairness. 
Theory: Good as a last resort. Please don't spread through your blocks. Respond accordingly, and with clash. I generally err neg on theory. You should have clear examples of in round abuse.
Etc.:
- The 2NR/2AR should write the ballot for me
- Case is underutilized in 2NR's
- Go as fast as you'd like, but clarity > speed
- There is a difference between being assertive and being rude
- I appreciate funny speeches but please don't try to be funny if you're not
- Yes I want to be on the email chain: christinaxodair@gmail.com
