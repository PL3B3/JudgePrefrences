  Dear ladies and gents,

I did LD from 2000-2004 at S.F. Austin High in Austin, TX under Stacy Thomas and Joey Seiler.

All I can really say is that as the judge, I want you tell me exactly what to do and why.

I'm ok with prestandard issues, overviews, etc if well warranted.
Please make the standard clear and then link your arguments to it. I flow a decent amount, and I like a clean path of logic when it comes to this-clear extensions, crystallize, etc. Weigh for me so I don't have to.
Speed is fine. But clarity is more important than razzle-dazzle speed. So please be clear.
I love argument variety. You should tickle my palette by telling me of the many ways your opponent is wrong, slapping fresh cards against their case if possible (keeping in mind that they actually apply to said case). But most important is always giving me actual analysis as to why the argument is wrong.
I like what Ms. Thomas says about this: "I think intelligent debate is both substantive and strategic, not just one or the other." I agree.
