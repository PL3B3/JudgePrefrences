  Former Niskayuna High School Debater
Consistently Cleared

I'm currently a college student 3 years out. During my high school
years, I had a bit of success and a lot of experience debating on the
Northeast circuit, this is however, my first time judging at a major
tournament.

My paradigm is fairly liberal, I'm willing to accept any argument as
long as it's not factually incorrect. That being said, I'm not a big
fan of a priori voters, if you're going to go for them make sure it is
well developed and not just a 10 second blip. Please pay attention to
the framework and resolutional analysis debate, unless of course there
is a consensus. After determining a standard, I'll go to to the
contentions at which point hopefully I would like to see excellent
weighing and comparative analysis.

I don't have a problem with speed as long as I can understand you and
keep up on the flow - I'l let you know if I can't.
