  I am in the individual events pool, so will leave some comments about those.

In Oratory, I believe that the event is first and foremost a speech event, not interpretation. 
In Interpretation events, I am looking for your unique take on the piece you have selected, not just a copy of the way others have performed.
In Speech events, I am looking for tight organization and meaningful content. If you have a well delivered speech but don't actually say anything
of any substance, you won't do well.
