  I have debated for 8 years, four in high school and four in college. I debate in Kansas, I did both policy and K stuff. I have debated four years for Emporia State, where I did some policy debate (mostly space) my first year. Since then I have done kritikal debate. I am not a K hack, reading a K will not get my ballot. I have read a lot different literature so I am familiar with many arguments, however you need to explain your buzzwords and not assume I know what you are talking about.

I think that debate is what you make it, if you can prove that what you did is an argument and it was good I'll vote for it. Play music, read poetry, refuse to speak, tell a story, read a genealogy, dance, act out a story, play a video, do some art stuff, make noises, read a million cards, read a heg adv. Whatever you wanna do it, do it well. I can keep up with up most everything you wanna do, speed is fine, but if I cannot understand what you are saying I will say clear once, then stop flowing.

I will not vote for arguments that are just blatantly oppressive or violent (e.g. don't say racism good or not real).
