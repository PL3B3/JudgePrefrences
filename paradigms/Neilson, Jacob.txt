Paradigms:

Policy:

You can run anything you want, but you better know and understand what you are saying. Enunciate your arguments, spreading does you no good if you are mumbling. Kritiks and Topicality arguments should only be used if the opposing team is either abusive or non-topical, this is why they were created. It is not the Aff's fault that they have to debate the topic.

LD:

First and foremost this is a Value debate, not a Fact or Policy debate treat it as such. Speed is ok with me as long as you enunciate your arguments, NO MUMBLING and blurting out taglines. Definitions, Value/Criterion, basically all framework arguments tell me how I should look at the cases, you can't win purely off of these arguments. With this said I love V/C arguments.

Public Forum:

This is a Fact Debate, I expect it to be run as such. Speed, see above. I fully expect the 2nd speaker to begin clash, instead of waiting for the third speaker. Evidence and Logic are both a necessity in a Fact debate.
