If I can't understand you I'll clear you a couple of times but if you don't adjust it'll cost you.Make the round clear, so create a framework, justify it and link back to it. I'm pretty liberal when it comes to what structures you use but be explicit in describing them and justifying them.Engage with the actual debate as much as possible, don't try to game it with a highly technical strategy cause you don't want to have the debate you're supposed to be having.
