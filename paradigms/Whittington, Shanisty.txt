I competed in Lincoln Douglas for 3 years. I also competed in Parliamentary debate for a year in college. I have staffed both the Basic and Advanced LD courses at the Cameron University Speech and Debate Camp in Lawton. And I have been judging for 3 years.

Speed: Tis fine with me, just speak clearly or I will ask you to do so.

Argumentation: Offense wins debates. I enjoy Ks. I like CPs. Theory is cool. None of the last three are necessary to win my ballot, however. I say again, offense wins debates. I am not partial to bully arguments. I am not partial to blippy arguments. I like things that are warranted and well thought out. You haz new card in a rebuttal speech? Cool! Read it. Just don’t make a new argument in a rebuttal speech. And please, weigh the round at the end of the day. Tell me what I should vote on and I will do so. If you don’t… danger zone.

Speaker points: I almost never give out perfect speaks. If you are a good speaker and you don’t upset me then you should get 26-29 speaker points. If you make me really angry/offended then you can expect less brownie points when it is all said and done.
