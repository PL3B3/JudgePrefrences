  I teach debate and judge at every tournament we attend as a team. I value the fact that I can take my personal bias out of a round.Explain your framework clearly. Tell me how to evaluate the round; do not assume I will do it for you.I prefer you to avoid spreading. Don't sacrifice clarity for speed.The best debaters take the time to weigh/establish an impact.Be organized. Structure is very important in arguments.There's a difference between being aggressive and being rude - do not say anyone's argument is stupid or dumb. Be professional!I love debate. It is a place for students to have valuable, powerful discussions in an academic space.
