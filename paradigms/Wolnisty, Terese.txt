  I have been judging Public Forum Debate the past 6 years. I started judging LD last year, so do not consider myself an expert.

I would say I lean towards the "traditional LD" paradigm: Stuff such as theory and Kritiks, no thanks.
Keep the jargon to a minimum. If I don't know it, I won't vote for it.

Make my work easy by giving clear roadmaps and signposting along the way.

I believe that debate is still a speaking event and thus value speaking style. I expect a professional tone and pace, not something I'd hear at the cattle auction.

Civility and decorum is to be expected at all times.
