Debated three years in high school, currently a first year college debater.

I've judged only a few rounds on this resolution so far, but I have a decent familiarity with the topic.

I have run and will vote for arguments from any portion of the ideological
spectrum. I like to hear things I haven't heard before.

Honestly, I'm pretty open to any argument that you explain and impact well, although I will say
that I am not the hugest fan of theory debates unless there is real abuse in the round.

I really, really do not like having to call for evidence. Please explain your evidence during the round
so that I do not have to read it afterward.

Otherwise, argue whatever you like most to argue, and good luck!
