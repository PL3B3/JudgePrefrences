  Background:
3 years of local/circuit PF at Clements High School. 
Speed: 
I can flow pretty well. Anything just before spreading is fine. If you speak faster than I can write I will yell slower once. 
Paradigm:
I am a purely flow judge, however weighing arguments and speaking ability is critical. I prefer having a weighing mechanism at the beginning of the round to tell me how I am going to evaluate the debate if none is given I'll just default on UTIL. I want you to write the ballot for me without much judge intervention on my part. 
Summary/FF:
The summary is critical to the final focus. All arguments presented in the final focus MUST have been extended in the summary, I will look at my flow to double-check this. If something is extended in the final focus and not the summary I will NOT evaluate it. 
Cards/Evidence:
Summarizing cards is fine as long as the author is cited, and a saved PDF/card is available to read. If I think a card seems fishy or blatantly falsified I will call for it and possible dock your speaks.
Speaker points: 
Regardless of how the round went, I will never give below 28 speaks. Debaters who are exceptional at speaking will usually receive a 29-30.
Theory:
I am completely fine with theory being used in PF debate, HOWEVER real in round abuse needs to have occurred. If you try to run theory to pick up an easy ballot I will probably be mildly annoyed. 
Kritiks
No.
Additional stuff:
I like good logical arguments in PF debate, if an argument just seems fishy or illogical I may not buy it.
