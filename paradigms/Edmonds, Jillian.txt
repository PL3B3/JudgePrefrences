  I debated for three years in high school (at Bingham High School in Utah).
Overview: I prefer debates with lots of clash (so go with case-specific stuff rather than your generics). I don’t really have a general preference for arguments, I will listen to anything. At the end of the round, I like to hear some good impact calculus, a lot of reasons to vote for you, and some overviews.
Speed: As long as you are clear, I don’t care. If you’re not, you’re losing speaker points and I may not catch every argument that you make. Slow down slightly for theoretical arguments if you want me to get everything on the flow.
Theory: I have a fairly high threshold on theory (and topicality), but will vote on anything if you argue it well enough. To win topicality or theory, you must invest time into it and make good arguments.
Kritiks: Make arguments that show that you’re familiar with the literature and know what your authors are talking about. I like a lot of explanations with kritiks, so overviews are good. Explain how the kritik applies in the round that you’re in and how the alternative functions especially. Establish specific links and a good story in order for me to vote for you.
Topicality: I will generally view this as an issue of ground, so if you don’t prove ground loss as a negative team, you’ll probably lose. Otherwise, establish an alternative framework besides ground for me to view topicality if you want to win.
