  Dear Folks,

I am the head debate coach at the Awty International School in Houston. I have been coaching for three years. I did not debate in either high school or college.

That being said, here is my philosophy for LD.

1. Spreading: I am ok with speed as long as I you are clear and distinct. I need crystal clear taglines for your contentions and for your sub arguments. Anything that is too fast for me to flow, I will not count in my deliberations.

2. Value/Criterion: Absolutely necessary. I believe every round needs a solid value and a weighing mechanism. I also need a strong link between your value and criterion. Don't just present two words or ideas to me without linking them.

3. Theory: whatever. As long as you make logical impacted arguments, I don't care.

4. Argument Structure: I am in favor of classic argument structure. Every one of your arguments needs to have a claim, warrant, and impact. Every one of your arguments needs to link back to your value and your criterion. I tend to favor real world evidence over loosey goosey hypothetical situations. Read into that whatever you will.

5. Voters: I need them. Clearly. From aff and neg. I DO NOT vote on definitions. I don't care if you have a better definition of "is". Go down the flow, remind me about dropped arguments, and tell me why your value/criterion structure outweighs.

6. Speaks: I won't give below a 27 in championship debate unless you are totally clueless in the round.
