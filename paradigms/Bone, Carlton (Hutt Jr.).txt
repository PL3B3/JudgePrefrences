I will pretend to be tab as best as I can…this means I will not exclude any arguments, styles or tactics on face; I will wait for you both to debate it out;  make the decision rule (why you win) explicit and use it in the rebuttals to help me clear up my flow. I’m fine with speed, I evaluate the quality of arguments using the standard community model; claims, warrants, impacts, “work”, unless I’m persuaded to do otherwise. I do find debates focusing on standards are more pleasing to judge because my decision calculus is simpler than evaluating competing, poorly warranted claims without a basis for comparison…but I end up doing that a lot too and that’s fine. Don’t be unnecessarily rude. I believe this is your activity. Enjoy the round.
