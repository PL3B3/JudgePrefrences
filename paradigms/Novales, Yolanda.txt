When it comes to knowing debate jargon (counterplan, disadvantage, permutation, inherency, etc.), I consider myself

1 2 3 4 5
Still learning: try to limit jargon Fairly comfortable, but with advanced debate theory, be careful Very comfortable with debate jargon: don’t worry



In the CDL, judges may ask for evidence after a debate. In making my decision,

1 2 3 4 5
Never read evidence Occasionally read evidence Frequently read evidence



While the debate is taking place, debaters should:

1 2 3 4 5
Ignore my nonverbal expressions Watch for occasional non-verbals Pay attention—I have expressive non-verbals
(nonverbal expressions include: smiling, nodding, frowning, shaking head, putting pen down, etc.)



On this year’s topic, I consider my knowledge:

1 2 3 4 5
Very limited (avoid acronyms) Passable (I have basic background/history) Extensive (Have researched myself)



6. Advice for JV debaters:
Just be confident in your debate rounds, don’t go in thinking you’re already going to lose, go in thinking you’re going to win.
Prepare yourself for what is yet to come when comes down to advancing from JV to Varsity, for it is different than when you first started. Other than that, I wish you the best.


7. Advice for Varsity debaters:
Don’t be over confident. Being in varsity doesn’t mean you know it all or have it all down as far debate goes. Be humble and always be willing to hear when your coaches or judges have to tell you.
