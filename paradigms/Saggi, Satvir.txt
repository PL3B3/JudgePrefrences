Milpitas High School '14 
UCLA '18

About me: Iâ€™m a Microbiology major at UCLA and debated LD at Milpitas High School for 3 years. During my senior year I cleared at most of the bid tournaments I attended.

Short Version
I was, if not, the biggest theory hack in high school and therefore, I prefer theory/topicality debate. Additionally, I find most non-util/non-K positions dull. 

Long Version:

Speed: Go for it but slow down on taglines and analytics. I'll say clear if I have to.

Theory/Topicality
- I'm a better judge for these type of debates.
- Default to competing interpretations but can be persuaded otherwise.
- Default to drop the debater and no RVIs.
- Fine with a laundry list of theory spikes, tricks, paragraph theory, disclosure theory, metatheory, K of Theory, AFC, etc. Basically you can read any type of shell you as long as it is written well. 
- I enjoy good topicality debate.
- Go ahead and read multiple theory shells. (I'll still evaluate "Multiple Theory Shells Bad")

Presumption
I'll presume whatever you say. I'll flip a coin if no presumption arguments were made clear.

FW/ Substance/ Ks
In regards to substantive debate, these are my my preferences, from most to least preferred, for an ideal substantive round: 
- Plan/CP/DA rounds
- Kritiks 
- Most non-util positions 

Micropolitics
- Unfamiliar but go for it. Please give me an explicit methodology as to how I should vote.

Miscellaneous
- I will call for evidence if I have to.
- I am not afraid to presume if the flow becomes too messy
- Don't spend all 6 minutes if it's clear that you're going to win the round.
- Make clear extensions
- Come to the round pre-flowed
-Flash or pass papers regardless of if your school has a "policy".
