  I am a parent judge and this is my first year judging the middle school debates. I don't have significant experience in judging but I am well versed with the format and process of the debates.

I would expect to see a well defined framework for the argument.

I value clarity more than speed. This doesn't mean that you cannot say multiple things in the short time that you have, it's , just that if you are fast, you need to be clear.

I would expect that when you are running an argument, it makes logical sense. If it is complex or you are tying bring up a very unique point, please take the time to explain clearly. 

I value intelligent argumentation, and would be generous in giving speaker points if you are able to give smart responses to your opponents rather than reading from pre-written note cards


I would expect that you demonstrate mutual respect to your co participants and the judge.
Good Luck.
