   
I debated for Strake all four years of my high school career and graduated in 2009. I’m currently attending Texas A&M.

1.) Speed: I can generally follow fast debaters, but they need to be clear. I’ll yell “clear” if you do end up debating too quickly/unclearly.
2.) Theory: I don’t like it, but if your opponent is actually being abusive, I will vote on theory.
3.) Post-modernism: Most likely, I won’t be able to understand these arguments, so if you do decide to run it, you need to be sure you’re absolutely clear.
4.) Speaks: Be polite to your opponent. I’ll also determine speaks based off your clarity and the quality of your argumentation.
5.) Presumption: I’ll accept arguments for presumption. But if there is no good reason to vote for either side at the end of the debate, I’ll probably vote based off the quality of argumentation.

If you have any other questions, just ask me before the round.
