  I'm pretty flexible because I view debate as a game. I don't care whether your argument is something that sounds ridiculous on face; however, justifications are important and prefacing your assertion with some author's name usually doesn't count as a warrant for me. Also, I want warrants extended in every speech, not just impacts. 

I can handle speed to a certain extent but I have definitely judged rounds where debaters were talking too fast for me to follow. 

I'm a first year law student at Emoy and I have B.S. in math and philosophy from NC State. Though I like philosophy, I'm not found of continental philosophy, 19th century philosophy, post-modernism, nor the like. This is what usually leads me to dislike K's. Analytical and early modern philosophy are my favorites.

Along with philosophy, I really enjoy economics. I'm usually a fan of the Chicago school tradition but I'm willing to vote for arguments that point the other direction.  

I LOVE theory and procedurals and I have no prima facia problem with a priori arguments.

Feel free to use flex-prep.

I have no problem with negative plans but I'm also willing to listen to your opponent if she claims that something is wrong with running them.

Sign-posting is a must. Voters are optional.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round.
