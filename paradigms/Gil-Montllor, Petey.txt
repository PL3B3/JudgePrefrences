  Petey Gil-Montllor
 Coach: Stuyvesant, formerly Trinity Prep
 

I debated for Schreiber from '02-'05, coached Trinity Prep from '05-'09, and now work at Stuyvesant. I have taught at VBI, SNFI, Pinnacle and CAD.
I evaluate all arguments as directed by the debaters and have no preference between offense/defense or truth-testing paradigms. If you can debate slowly and developed a nuanced position based on rigorous analysis rather than spikes and a prioris, I will be more impressed. Ask me any specific questions before the round.
