  I mostly debated policy style arguments while in high school, so I’m most familiar with those arguments. That doesn’t mean I won’t vote on other arguments – just make it clear enough for me to explain in the RFD and I’ll be comfortable voting for it. There are a few exceptions for morally reprehensible arguments and arguments that create a hostile or unsafe area for the others in the round.

I share a lot of the same views as Henry Zhang
