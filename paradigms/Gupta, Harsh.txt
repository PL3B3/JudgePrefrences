Parent Judge, 

I have judged in the past mostly DI. First time judging LD December 2014.

If you use Jargon please make sure to at least once let me know what that means.
I prefer traditional LD style using value and criterion, Moderate speed is fine as long as it is clear and understandable.
I will listen to what you have to say; I will listen to how you think I should vote, and why, claiming that you have one on issues will not go well without evidence. Explain clearly why you have won certain issues, and why those issues should determine how I vote.
