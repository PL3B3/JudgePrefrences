I did CX for 4 years at Clear Lake High school. I qualified for TFA state 3 times and broke once. I debated both policy and critical arguments and I feel pretty comfortable evaluating most arguments. 

T/Theory-I enjoy topicality debates more than most judges. Personally, I think T is extremely strategic but just like any other argument, it should be impacted and explained well. I have no real biases on other theory. I am most familiar with condo and consult arguments.

DAs-These are fine. Just be sure to have good impact analysis and turns case arguments. 

CPs-These are also fine. Consult and Delay are fair game just be ready to defend theory.

Ks- I am like most judges here. I really enjoy a good K debate, but I don't want the debate to devolve to the neg just repeating buzz words. It is important to explain the K in the context of the aff and explain how it turns and interacts with the aff. I am most familiar with Cap K, but I have no bias against any other K and I enjoy evaluating them.

Performace/Affs that aren't fiated-No bias here, but I am not really familiar with them.

Speed is fine as long as it doesn't interfere with your clarity. Other than that, I just want all the debaters to have fun and learn a lot. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
