  I debated LD for Harker High School. I now coach Northwood and Lynbrook.

I mostly debated policy and critique arguments, but read some more stuff my senior year (take a look at my wiki from last year)

I judge alot like Ryan Fink.
The bane of my existence in debate is the word "precludes". With the exception of theory arguments, I view all of debate as impacts and impact calculus, whether that be framework, critiques, policy args, etc... This means I view frameworks, most k tricks, and other generally "preclusive" arguments as weighing. This is not to say that these arguments are worthless, but rather that I will very likely not be convinced by an NR that concedes the whole aff and goes exclusively for Root Cause, framework arguments, or other similar weighing arguments.
