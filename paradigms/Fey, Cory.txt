  I debated through high school and have been judging/assistant coaching for the last 15 years.

I don't prefer speed, quality over quantity. I do not announce my preferences in arguements as the round is not mine, but if you or your school have had me as judge in the past, you know which one's I do not prefer. If you don't understand it or you cannot deliver it properly and answer questions about it, don't run it. I look to topicality first and am policy option after that.
