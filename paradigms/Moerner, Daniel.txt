  Judge Philosophy â€“ Daniel Moerner

I was the 2009 TOC Finalist. I am conflicted from Los Altos High School, Mountain View High School, and Northland Christian High School.

I will only vote for arguments that I understand as justifying the ballot. The fact that I study philosophy makes it even more important for you to slow down for complex argumentation, because I have little tolerance for fake explanations that fail to come to grips with the cards you are reading.

Barring arguments in favor of alternate paradigms, I presume in the following ways on most issues. If any arguments are made for other paradigms, these initial preferences will be ignored.

1. I assume the affirmative has the burden to prove the resolution true, and the negative must prove the negation of the resolution. I assume that "prove" requires an offensive argument.

2. I assume that potential abuse claims are insufficient to vote on theory. I assume a "default and challenge" structure for topicality arguments, meaning that I presume that textual interpretations are topical barring explicit arguments that they are theoretically abusive.

Please show respect for all parties in the room. In order to keep rounds running on time, I prefer to limit my RFD to comments relevant to my decision. If you'd like specific comments and suggestions to improve, feel free to approach me any time.
