  I'm an undergrad at UPenn. I did LD for 4 years in NC, competing both locally and on the national level. I know a fair bit of philosophy and statistics; don't expect me to know everything about the philosophers you might reference when reading your case, however don't grossly misrepresent a major name (Kant, Locke, Mill, etc.) or BS statistics because I will notice.

Don't make it a value-based debate. Obviously I need a value to weigh the round through, however if you can agree on one quickly, I will be a happy camper. Of course, if you can't link through a framework, don't accept it but I absolutely hate having to decide a debate solely based on what value I pick (because each side would only link through its own).

I value a few strong arguments over many, weak, quickly-read arguments. I can understand a brisk pace but prefer clarity over speed. Translation: I am a traditional judge.

I will flow, but, slowing down at important points (like contention tag lines), will help me get all of your points. If you talk too fast and I miss an argument, that only hurts you. I will not interrupt you to tell you to slow down.

I like clear voters given in the last speech for each side. 

Also be decent to each other. Any ad hominem attacks will lose you points.
Don't be racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.

Pet Peeve: "Begging the question" and "Raising a question" are not the same thing. Please don't confuse them.
Consequentialism and Utilitarianism are different. Util is a subset of Consequentialism. Don't treat them as synonyms 

Don't expect me to make logical connections for you. It's your job to make the argument and as much as I might agree with what's in your head, I can't vote on it unless you say it out loud.
