I graduated from Schaumburg High School in 2012 after competing in Congressional and LD Debate for 4 years.

I evaluate most rounds based on the resolution of the standards debate and arguments linked to the standards.

I am open to alternative forms LD argumentation so long as it is clear and you give clear explanations for why I should vote for you.

Don't speed through incredibly dense philosophy or 500 theory shells - I won't be able to flow it. I'll say "clear" twice if you're being unclear.
