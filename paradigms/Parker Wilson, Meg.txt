  While I competed in Puff several times throughout my 7 year career in the NSDA and Pi Kappa Delta, I am new to coaching Debate. 
I am enjoying LD and will judge based on arguments and the clarity of speech and communication. I appreciate thorough research, good reasoning and staying on topic. I am not familiar enough with the "unspoken rules of" Lincoln Douglas or the national circuit style; therefore I will not look for these techniques.

Thank you.
