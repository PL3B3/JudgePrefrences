  I am returning to the policy debate community as a co-coach for Traverse City Central High School. I debated at Gaylord High School for four years, attended SDI camps two years, coached and judged regionally with Gaylord High School, and am starting with the team in TC after a bit of a break from the community looking to be a part of the rebuilding of the program there. 

Paradigm: In many ways I like to think of myself as a tab judge in that I want you to frame the round and tell me where to vote and why, but I tend to default to a comfort zone of Policy Making and choosing the side which has a well developed framework on which I can vote. As a teacher, it is most important to me that you understand your arguments and learn from the process, so if you can create a framework that convinces me I should vote on it and is well argued I will vote on any argument. 

Speed: I can handle some speed, but please enunciate. Be sure to be clear on your tags and subpoints. Do not use speed as a tool to confuse. I would rather hear quality arguments and clash than spreading just for the sake of confusing your opponent.

Kritiks: I have no problem with K debate, but for me it must be combined with a quality impact analysis or alternative including a way for me to evaluate the round. I am not familiar with each and every critical argument in circulation at this time, and while I get comfortable with theory it is in your best interest to do the work to explain to me the quality of your framework and why I need to vote in this way. If I or your opponent cannot follow or understand the K and it is being used to win on a default without work or understanding on your part I will have hard time voting on the argument.

DA/CPs: These are great with me. Be thorough in your cards and links, and solid in your impact calc on the DA. Again, understanding of your own arguments are key for learning in the round. Please do not run blocks written by others which you do not understand. 

Procedure: Be polite. This is an educational process and should be respected by all competitors. Regardless of your experience level in this community, we are all still learning.

I strongly prefer that you do your own CXs. Each team member should be able to articulate the arguments and should not rely on the other(again learning is the key). I will let you know if your tag-team gets out of hand.

Politeness and respect in the round is a TOP priority. I do not find any flashy behavior appropriate, and will take speaker points for rude interruptions during constructives or rebuttals, cursing or inappropriate language, racist/sexist/classist/xenophobic/homophobic comments to other people in-round, arrogant or insulting comments even if you believe you are winning the round.

Other:

-Road map before each speech. If I don’t know where you’re going my flow is already not in your favor. 
-Having a card on something doesn't always beat good analytical arguments 
-I will not assume dropped arguments are true if you haven’t done the work to extend it.
-Good analysis needs to make it all the way through to the final speeches.
-I need to be able to understand and find your arguments to vote on them, be organized!
-I will not usually be able to disclose at the end of the round. I need time to look over my flow and decide. 


I am a little rusty and new, admitting that to you upfront. I'm always working on learning as a judge and updating my paradigm.I think all types of debate are interesting and enjoyable as long as you do it well.I am not perfect. I am a teacher and a learner, so please be a professional at all times during the round and in the tournament. Ask me questions, make good arguments, and help me understand why it is important to vote for you on any arguement. Have fun.
