  I. Introduction
I have been judging Lincoln Douglas since 2009. I did not participate in debate during high school or college, that means: I am a lay judge. Now before you sneer at me, please continue to read my philosophy.

Philosophy
Each round is a chance to win me over. I have no preconceived notions regarding the round.

Specific Issues
I am a traditionalist - I consider LD to be a persuasive event. If you talk fast, you are not being persuasive, you are simply throwing as much data against the wall as possible and hope some of it sticks. If you talk too fast, I have a tendency to tune out and you will not get value out of all the hard work you have put into your case. Don't spread. Spreading is not a winning strategy. 

If your speaking is not clear and I can not understand you, I will stop writing. If you fail to communicate clearly to me as your judge, how can you possibly expect me to make any decision at all? I am a sucker for a clear and crisp speaker every time.

Given that constraint, you may run any clever case you wish. If it's convincing, has data to back it up and supports your value.
