I debated for four years at Kent Denver School in Englewood, CO. I reached elim rounds of the TOC. I taught at VBI and NSD. I also coached for Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, NY from 2013 to 2014. 

I will vote on any argument with a warrant. While I debated, I ran anything from normative skepticism to pre-fiat arguments about discrimination (though I'm not a fan of the latter anymore). To quote based Christian Tarsney, my favorite debates to watch are: “(1) philosophical debates focused on normative framework, (2) empirical debates with lots of weighing and evidence comparison, (3) just plain stock debates, (4) 'critical' debates revolving around incoherent non-arguments from obscurantist pseudo-philosophers, and (5) theory debates.”

Speed is fine. I will call clear twice and then stop flowing until you slow down. I'd encourage you to be particularly aware of clarity when it comes to blippy spikes or theory standards. If the implication of an argument is unclear to me when it is presented, I will not treat its extension as if it has been conceded by your opponent. 

I default to truth-testing, reasonability, and drop the argument. I prefer not to disclose speaker points. If you have other questions, just ask before the round.
