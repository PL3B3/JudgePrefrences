Preferences:
As a judge, I really value clarity, confidence, and logic. I enjoy listening to well-spoken debaters who can skillfully develop an argument in a way that is both cohesive and interesting. Keep your arguments reasonable, as I do not enjoy dramatic/confusing/drawn out Ks, Cps, etc. Also, I would like to flow but have not debated in several years, so do keep this in mind when you are thinking about your speed. Remember that I want to be able to hear and understand your arguments more than anything. 
The way you and your partner conduct yourself during your speeches will be a major factor in my ultimate decision. Also, please recognize that I am not familiar with this year's topic, so in-depth explanation and clarity will go a long way. Over all, know that I do not want to be an intimidating presence in the room - I want to see you excel and enjoy the minutes you have to commanding the room.
