  I debated at Flower Mound High School and cleared at the TOC in LD my senior year (2013). I have also taught at the UNT and NSD debate camps.

I'll view the round however you tell me to as long as you justify it.
I base most of my judging views on an offense/defense paradigm. If you win the best weighted offense, you win the round.

My favorite things to see in LD are policy/util oriented arguments, critical arguments, and theory.

I don't really like:
1. Hidden/non-impacted a priori arguments
2. Presumption (I think there is always a risk of offense)

Specific things:

THEORY
I default to competing interpretations, but I'm open to other paradigms. I don't like offensive counter-interps, and RVIs need justification.

K
I like the K. I've read most authors used in debate and feel that I have a relatively comprehensive understanding. I'd enjoy a good and creative round.
That being said, I don't believe the K is always strategic and prefer strategy to you running a critical argument for the sake of me.

CP
If they have a good enough solvency advocate, I think they are probably legitimate.

SPEAKER POINTS
Strategy and clarity are the two things that will influence your speaker points.
I start at a 28, and you can go up or down from there.
