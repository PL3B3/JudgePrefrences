I am a new parent who has judge several policy debates in 2009-2010. While I have judged policy debates they have been at local tournaments where the competition is largely novice and sometimes junior-varsity. It is important to be slow and explain arguments. I know no debate jargon so make sure to avoid using it to get through rebuttals.
