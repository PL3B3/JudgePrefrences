  I participated in LD, policy and public forum debate but predominantly in LD. I went to circut tournaments including the TOC in LD as well as local tournaments with more "lay" judges. Since high school, I haven't stayed very current with the changing debate environment. I usually judge at 2-3 national tournaments per year. 
I prefer a typical criterion structure for cases and substance debate in rebuttals. I am fine with speed and will say "clear" if you are unclear, however if you can speak slower and cover arguments I will give you higher speaks. If it's clear that you're capable of going much faster than your less experienced opponant and choose to spread when it's unnecessary, I will give you low speaks. I understand that theory has a place in debate, but if you use it when the opponent is obviously not abusive it will probably not factor into how I vote, unless your oponent wins it, so don't do that. If you want to run a more complicated/philosophy-based/written by your seniors or coach type case, be sure you can explain it. When in doubt, I havent heard that card before so read it slowly and if I don't understand it after the round, it's because you didnt explain it to me well enough. That being said, I can understand those args and if you explain something well to me, I will be happy and you will win!

Be happy and be respectfull. Debate isn't life, it's a means for fun education.
