  I competed in Congressional Debate for four years; I also did a little Public Forum. I have seen some LD rounds, but this will be my first time judging LD. I will judge best if you deliver your speeches at a rapid conversational pace; if you spread, I am pretty likely not to understand you. I am debate-experienced, and I understand offense and defense and standards, but most theory will be new to me. I have no real argumentative predispositions, though I am unlikely to vote for debaters who abuse or harass others.
