I’ve had experience judging all types of debates, and competed in both Policy and LD. That said, I’m pretty open. But there are a few points of interest:

Speed: I don’t mind it at all. If you can provide a claim and warrant in your arguments, as well as be clear, then you are fine in my book. Clarity, I stress, clarity is key.

Policy arguments in LD: There is no such thing as a plan in this event, so why are there counterplans? Outside of that, I’m fine with topicality and kritiks. I can think of the resolution in a vacuum, only if you want me to.

Progressive vs. traditional: I can almost guarantee you that progressive has been progressive for a long time. I don’t really care about that.

Substance is key. I want to be told a story of how the world works and how you can engage your opponent in that world. I want to walk out of that round knowing more (or having a different perspective) than I’ve seen before. I need to know the big picture and the smaller bits all the same. I need you to weigh what you say, and give me voters with weight.

You need not stand in CX. I will allow for flex if the tournament gives the okay.

Please ask me any questions. I know there are things that I did not cover that are important to you. If you don’t ask, you will never know.
