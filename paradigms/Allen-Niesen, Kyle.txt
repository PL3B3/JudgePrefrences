  I debated for Brentwood in Los Angeles for four years in high school, and graduated in 2012. I qualified to TOC and went to NFL nationals my junior and senior years. 

If this page is ever relevant again, it will have been a long time since I've judged a debate. I won't be able to understand speed, so go slowly, and explain all your arguments clearly. I haven't kept up with the arguments and styles that are the flavor of the topic/year, so essentially treat me as a smart parent judge who will flow (slowly) and evaluate you based on your arguments rather than just overall persuasion.
