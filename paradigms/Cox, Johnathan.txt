  I did LD at Apopka High School for two years. I have also debated in college parliamentary debate for Rollins College. I am willing to evaluate any argument, especially kritikal arguments, but I prefer the arguments to be delivered with relatively slow speed. I do not need you to speak conversationally, but if you spread at full speed I likely will not be able to understand you.

Types of arguments I will vote for on a scale of 1 (will not vote) to 5 (likely to vote):

Plans - 4
Counterplans - 4
DA - 4
K - 5
Traditional LD - 4
Topicality - 4
Theory - 4
Frivolous Theory - 2
