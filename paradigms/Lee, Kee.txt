  Hello, I am Ken Lee. I am the father of two debaters, one policy and one LD. I am a seasoned judge in the debate world. I will not keep track of your time, nor will I say clear or slow. If I do not understand or take note of a certain argument because you are going too fast, that is not my fault, it is yours. Only ask vital questions before the round, please try not to ask me questions during or after the debate. Put simply, no jargon, no acronyms, no rudeness, etc, otherwise your speaker points will suffer accordingly. Please clearly outline your framework and do plenty of weighing.
