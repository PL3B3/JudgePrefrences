  Just found out that I will be judging JV and not varsity but thought I would post anyway.

I've judged policy for the last 12 years, mostly at local tournaments. Have judged policy at the nationals in Las Vegas and Kansas City but by no means consider myself a national circuit judge. I coach and judge Public Forum and only judge Policy when needed - 3 to 4 tournaments/year.

In general I vote stock issues. Not particularly fond of T arguments - a waste of time unless there is an egregious violation. Counter plans are OK if run well. Speed can be moderate to moderately fast. Slowing down for tag lines helps. I am attending some of our practice rounds but not judged this year's topic.

If you want to argue extinction, that's OK but I'm more impressed when arguments establish inevitability first, then magnitude. 

Within civil bounds, its always good to see hard fought round.
