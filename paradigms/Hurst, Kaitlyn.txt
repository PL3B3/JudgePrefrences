Kaitlyn is unqualified to judge debates. -Lawrence Zhou 

Background
 I debated for Norman High School (OK) for 3 years. Attended the Oklahoma State tournament twice, placing second most recently. I attended NSDA nationals my senior year. I'm most experienced with traditional debate but I have exposure to progressive styles. I can handle pretty much anything if done well. 

Preferences
 
Speaking Preferences
 Speed is generally fine. I'm somewhat familiar with high speed rounds but I'm not comfortable with intense spreading especially if you know you aren't going to be 100% clear the whole round. I'll say clear if I can't understand you. Slow down for important information (tags, card info, etc.)
Framework
 I think the framework debate is important to the round but it's not a deciding factor. I prefer a holistic approach to the resolution and will decide based on everything you present meValue/criterion aren't necessary. Do what you want to do, I can follow. 
Theory
 I default to competing interps.Weighing is crucialI will listen to potential abuse as an argument.
CX
 CX is binding.Don't lie or intentionally obscure your answers.I don't care whether you sit or stand, but be engaged.

Weighing
 Weighing is the difference between bad debate and decent debate. Please do it early and often. Explain your clash and interactions with their arguments.
How to Get Good Speaks
 Show me clashDon't just tell me not to vote for "them", give me a reason to vote for you. Be polite and respectful. If you are overly aggressive and rude not only is that off putting but it takes away a lot of your legitimacy in the round.Clarity
