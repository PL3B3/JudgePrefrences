  Hello! My name is Joseph. I am a former competitor with 2 and a half years of experience in parli/LD debate. I am fine with speed and I am open to virtually all arguments. I love critical issues and will accept Kâ€™s from either team. I am a flow judge so I believe that drops are potentially very significant. On procedural issues I will vote on articulated abuse but I generally find demonstrated abuse to be annoying. Running a Disad just to prove ground skew is time consuming and results in no clash. I believe that most debates are won in the rebuttal so weigh out and TELL ME WHERE TO VOTE! Most importantly, have fun!
