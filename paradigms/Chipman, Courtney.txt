  I am the Assistant Director of Debate for Nova High. I have 8 years of experience in debate and I am most familiar with traditional cases, but I appreciate well-run K's and counterplans. i am not a huge fan of theory cases but as long as it is clear I will be able to follow. I flow rounds but I ask that you do not spread!

Things that stand out to me in a debate are as follows:
the debater who proves their side by weighing the round for me and provides arguments that clash well with the opponents case.For the K arguments, so long as the K is proven to have utmost importance prior to solving or engaging with the resolution, it will make sense.Debate is clear and has provided some means of solvency
Good luck!
