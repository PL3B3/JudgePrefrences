  Debated for 3 years at Richardson High School, have experience in LD and PF. 

LD: I'm down with pretty much anything as long as you understand it and communicate it effectively to me. Speed is fine usually but if I can't understand you, I will say "Clear" once and if I'm still unable to flow, I'll just put my pen down. I really like framework/layer debates, so if you can show me why your argument is more substantive and has a larger impact, you're likely to have my favor. However, if both debaters default and there's no set fw or anything for me to look at, I'll simply go line-by-line.

Kritiks, Theory, T, and DAs are all fine in my book as long as there is a good argument present and it makes sense. If you read me a theory shell just for the hell of it, I will definitely consider RVI and other arguments that the opposing debater might make. PICs, blip theory and theory spikes are still sort've new to me so I'm okay with them but you will hold yourself susceptible to opposing theory. 

PF: Not as much experience, just be clear and logical. In my experience, the debaters who present the best arguments uniquely and with substantive evidence will win. I don't really have any preference, I simply expect to hear some pretty well developed and flowing arguments. 

Speaks will usually be 27+, with 29.5-30 given to the winner. However, if you're just sloppy and don't make any sense, expect a 28. Not cool with derogatory comments or attitudes either, I won't vote you down for it but you can bet your speaks took a hit. 

Just ask me before round if you have anything you want me to clarify on.
