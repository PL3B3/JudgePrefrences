  I have been a parent judge for LD for the past 6 years. If you speak so quickly that I cannot follow you, what you say won't count in the round. So don't spread. Also, if your arguments are too convoluted to where I can't follow you, they won't count in the round. Explain the point of cards that you use in round: aka make sure to impact them back to something and explain the basic logic of the card. Also, make sure that you act and dress professionally. Attitude and sloppiness will make you lose points. I judge straight off the flow. Whoever wins the most important arguments and links them to the most important value wins the round.
