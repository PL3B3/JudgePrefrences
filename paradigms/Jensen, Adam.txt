1) Proven in-round abuse outweighs everything else.
2) Unanswered case-turns are automatic Aff. loss unless the Neg. doesn't bring them up through the rebuttals
3) Otherwise, good impact calc with proven (in this order) Probability, Timeframe, Magnitude will probably win most other rounds.
4) Speed fine, tag-team fine (as long as the non-cxing partner doesn't dominate), all arguments fine but see above.

Any questions let me know!
