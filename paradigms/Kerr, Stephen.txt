I have judged policy ad LD debate for the past 5 years on and off. I have little experience on the National Circuit and would not say that I am well versed in the “technical” aspects of debate. I do not enjoy spreading, instead I judge debate rounds by looking at both the skill with which speeches are delivered and the quality of the arguments made.
