  For background, I graduated from Loyola Law School in 1991, and am licensed to practice in Louisiana and Florida. I have been judging Lincoln Douglas for four years.

As as a judge, I am always looking for a few things. Organization, clarity, and time management are crucial in every debate round. I also rely heavily on the substance of your rebuttals as opposed to repetition of your own case or bringing something up "for the sake of the flow." I must be able to clearly understand your contentions, value, and value criterion. Since it is difficult for me to flow and understand spreading, I would strongly encourage coherent, understandable speaking. I also expect courtesy and respect during all questioning periods and speeches. Additionally, the quantity and quality of evidence is very important to me when weighing your arguments. Lastly, my region argues strictly traditional cases; thus I would strongly recommend that you argue a traditional as opposed to a progressive case in the round.

If if you have any specific questions, please ask me before the round.
