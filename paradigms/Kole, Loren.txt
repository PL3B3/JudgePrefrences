  I am open to spread as long as your clarity does not suffer, and am somewhat comfortable with non-traditional LD strategies. I have a working knowledge of philosophy, and have a strong foundation in traditional ethics. Theory arguments need to be well warranted and impacted. I am not likely to vote in favor of a theory case unless it can stand alone, and I will be inclined to vote against you if it is a tactic to take up time. Your arguments should be clearly impacted, either through a criterion debate or a comprehensive framework analysis. Devoid of such an impact argument, I will default to straight argument-impact analysis.

Do not spit cards. I put much more weight into your impact analysis and the overall narrative of the round anyway. 

Be courteous and sporting with your opponent. Attack arguments not people. If you are rude your speaks will suffer.
