  I debated for 7 years - four at Glenbrook North, 2 at North Texas, 1 (and a tournament in year 2) at Redlands. I like any and all arguments (caveat: I don't like arguments that start with the assumption that I'm going to hell because I'm not a Christian). I'll vote on theory, I'll vote on performance, I'll vote on framework, I'll vote on politics, I'll vote on whatever is won. I don't really know what else to say here regarding my preferences.

Also, I know NOTHING about this (Space, 2011-2012) topic, I have yet to judge a round on it and I haven't taught it at a camp.
