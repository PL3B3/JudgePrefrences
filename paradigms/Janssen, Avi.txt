  I am a parent of a third year policy debater. I have been trained to judge policy, but I am still relatively new to it; slower delivery will certainly help me make a good decision, and I absolutely need debaters to speak at a conversational pace when reading taglines. Without clear tags, I will likely not be able to follow the round very well. I have no argumentative preferences or ideological predispositions, but I will be most comfortable judging a traditional policy round (USFG action, DA's/CP).
