  I'm a tab judge. I'll vote for anything.
T: Topicality is all about interpretation. If your interpretation of Topicality is that Topicality is bad for debate then go for it. If your interpretation is that without a set form of definitions and standards debate is meaningless then go for it. Just give me voters. Tell me why I should vote on something.

CP/Disads: I like them, especially when they are deployed strategically. Use them however/whenever you want to. I don't care how small the risk is if you can prove the risk is there or isn't there I'll vote for it. I

Ks: I love them. However, please please please give me decent framework. Set up the round how you want it.

Framework: I want to hear how the debaters want to be judged and why I should vote a certain way. Framework does that.

Theory: I have no predispositions on it, I don't err to aff or neg. Please justify your theory though.

Performance: Again give me framework and you can do whatever you want. I will vote on anything.

Please, for the love of God do an impact calculus.

I feel that debate is what you make it. If you want to sing Disney songs and relate it to Baudrillard's evidence on metaphorical Disney World go for it. I know your performance has backing just make sure you give me framework. I work for you.
