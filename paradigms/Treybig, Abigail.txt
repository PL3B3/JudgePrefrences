  I assistant coach at Juan Diego Catholic High school in Utah. This is my third year coaching, the previous two years I helped the public forum students and ended up taking two teams to the TOC, the head coach decided to finally open policy to the kids at the end of the season. I voluntarily offered to help get it started because I was around policy in high school and comfortable teaching others. This is our first year of competitive policy traveling around.

I myself understand policy but am still very new to competitive national circuit. I am pretty good at keeping up with speed, just as long as it's clear. I am not a big fan of T but will vote on it, if it's reasonable. I'm a big fan of K's if they are run properly and the debater understands what he/she is running. I'm down for a little bit of theory. I like disadvantages but if they are specific and not a generic disadvantage. I'm really down for anything as long as it's done right.
I want you to tell me where and how to vote. I love hearing the phrase "even if you don't think I'm winning this argument, you still vote because..."
