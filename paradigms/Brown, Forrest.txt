I debated in high school in Missouri from 2006-10. Ian Miller and I were top seed at DDI in 2008. 
I'm a senior at Harvard and I live with NDT semifinalists Michael Suo and Brad Bolman. I haven't debated here, but they've kept me engaged.

I'm most familiar with policy style, but I don't have any strong commitments. You should make the arguments you think are best and explain them well. I'll evaluate your arguments on their logic.

You should try to be persuasive as a speaker. With your logic, your inflection, and maybe a few jokes. Be captivating, and don't be rude.
