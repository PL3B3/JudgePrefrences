  Hello debater! I'm currently a senior, and I do LD for Montville. I'm pretty bad. 
I did policy debate once. It was bad. 

I'm okay with moderate speed. I prefer traditional arguments although I will vote off theory/Ks/etc. Please don't ever let the round go to presumption. Please provide a clear ballot story.
I give speaks from 27.5 to 30 unless you bring me a cookie. Then you can add one point to your total.
