  LD Judge Philosophy. I am a traditional LD judge. I decide the debate on the strength of your arguments not the number of them. Talking fast is tolerable, spreading is not. Lincoln Douglas is a philosophical debate. I need to see your philosophy at work and to be confident that you understand the philosophy you are quoting. If you don't know what the categorical imperative is, or the veil of ignorance, don't quote them. I need to see links between your V, VC and contentions, but most importantly, I need to see clash. Signpost for me, summarize the debate, tell me why you think you won, all those good things, just don't tell me what I "Must do".
