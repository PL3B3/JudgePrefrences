  I don’t consider a judging philosophy to be very important, and I don’t want anyone to make arguments specifically to appeal to me as a judge, so I’m going to keep this short and sweet.

I consider myself to more of a k debater, so I’m open to Ks on either aff or neg.

If you’re running a policy aff and you have a lot of topic-specific acronyms, please explain to me what those acronyms mean.

I’m slightly disinclined to vote for T, but if you are clearly winning on that flow, I won’t hesitate to vote for you.

I don’t have any particular feelings about CPs or DAs, but if you go for one (or more) in the 2NR, make sure you tell the story, and clearly articulate to me why I should vote for you.

If you’re flashing evidence to the other team, prep time stops when you hand them the flash.

I like good impact calc from both the 2NR and the 2AR.

That’s pretty much it. I can be persuaded to vote for just about any argument, just use good logic and tell me why I should vote for you.

If you have any other questions, feel free to email me at csusandrew at gmail.com
