I don't mind critical arguments but remember that in order to do so effectively, time is against you so you better be prepared to work. With this being said, speed is fine but not if it forsakes clarity. I feel like so much has been lost in LD because debaters think that going fast is the only thing that matters. Speed is okay if the content is genuine and clarity is not sacrificed.

I like to hear clear and comparative rebuttals. I love clash. Tell me how to weigh arguments, explain to me where and why you are winning the round, simply stating "extend across the flow" just won't work. Running theory is fine. 

As a judge, I'll keep up and follow where you go. Don't be a jerk in the round, be clear, and enjoy yourself.
