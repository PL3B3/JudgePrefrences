I competed on the national circuit for Harrison High School going to TOC, NSDA, and CFL so I am willing to adjudicate any type of debate with any arguments made.


I will pretty much evaluate rounds the same way that Marshall does so look there!

Additionally, my background as a debater definitely predisposes me to framework and Ks over tricks and util. I ran performances so I would love to vote on them but that doesn’t mean I won’t evaluate topicality or truth-testing arguments. I don’t really like satire and I’ll default to competing interps, no RVIs, and drop the debater. If there are any questions, feel free to message me on Facebook :)
