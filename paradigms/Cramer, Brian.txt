I did not debate in high school or collge I got into debate to help my wife with her debate team!

I began working as an assistant coach in 2002 and have judged a dozen tournaments each year since 2000.

While I haven't debated myself, debating for me is pretty straight forward. I do not like critiques, largely because it should be a more detailed debate than I am accustom to; I have been known to vote for them but that is a rare occassion & often because the debate was pretty clear. I also prefer not to hear theory debates.

I prefer to hear a policy round; I like case/disad debates and counterplan debates.

Speed is fine with me as long as tags & sites are clear and transitions obvious, please keep the flow clean - make sure you stick to your road map and avoid jumping around on the flow...if you jump around you will lose me, if you keep your flow clean I'll be right with you.

I don't like to read evidence so make sure you flush out the warrants and analysis in your evidence for me.

If you stick to a CP or case/da debate, make sure I get tags; you won't have any problems getting my ballot.
