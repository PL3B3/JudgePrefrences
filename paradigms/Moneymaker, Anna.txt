  My name is Anna Moneymaker and I am a parent judge from Newsome High School in Lithia Florida. I have never judged Lincoln Douglas, however I judged a few, local level, Public Forum rounds. My preference is no spreading, theory, or technical arguments. I am a 100% lay judge and you must make slow and clearly articulated arguments for me to follow the round. I am not interested in joining an email chain or receiving a speech document. My preference at this time is to judge a slow, traditional round.
If your strategy is to use spreading, theory, or technical arguments, I suggest for you to not select me as a preferred judge.
