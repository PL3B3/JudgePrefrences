  Hi this will be my third year judging LD and Policy at this tournament and I have a Speech and Debate backround. 

When it comes to spreading, I believe it is acceptable for Policy but not for LD. You can still talk quickly in LD but don't get too crazy with it. Clarity is huge, as without it all those words the speaker raced through have no context and does not support their argument. 

Value Criterion and values are obviously important and clarifying why you should win the debate in your last speech is a nice touch. 

Good Luck!
