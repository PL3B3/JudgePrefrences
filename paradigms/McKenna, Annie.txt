  In terms of style, you can speak fast provided you enunciate clearly and slow down for tag lines. Along those lines, please signpost effectively so I can follow what's going on.

In terms of arguments preferences, I prefer V/VC frameworks, but if you explain why another framework is better, that's fine too: the crucial thing is that you impact all your arguments back to that framework.

Finally, I have a high threshold for theory, and if you do use any, you would need to have a really good justification for it.
