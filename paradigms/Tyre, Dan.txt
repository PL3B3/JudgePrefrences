Philosophy:

1. I am open to any argument that is relevant to the resolution or the round. Offensive rhetoric and argumentation will at best be ignored and at worst cost you the round. I will not require your opponent to exert a great deal of energy refuting stupid or bad arguments.
2. Speed should be used with caution. This is only my third year judging LD and I typically judge in a slower circuit. Please do not assume I have read all the literature and evidence, and I caution you against going so fast that I canâ€™t think about the evidence. Gratuitous speed will result in lower speaker points, and may cost you the round. Speed must be accompanied by clear articulation and careful road-mapping.
3. I award speaker points on the basis of how well you manage the debate, your rhetorical skill, and the extent to which you advance the spirit of competitive debate. Civility is rewarded.
4. I do not appreciate theory arguments unless they are well-argued and point to a real instance of abuse.  In general, I think the resolutions are valuable and ought to be debated, and grow weary of stupid arguments that steal time from the debate of the resolution.
5. I appreciate it when you agree upon a standard, otherwise I will weigh the round using the standard I think is winning.
