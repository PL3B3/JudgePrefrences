  I’m a fairly lay judge. I prefer to see traditional rounds. I wouldn’t recommend running off cases unless you can clearly explain the function of it in the round. I think debaters have become lazy with this. I dislike speed debate because it decreases our ability to communicate with each other. Basically, if you’re a quick circuit debater you might want to strike me. If you engage in traditional debate I can be a good judge for you.
