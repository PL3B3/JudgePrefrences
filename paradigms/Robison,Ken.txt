  Background 
I am a debate coach at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas.
I enjoy a solid debate in LD that has solid arguments that link back to a value. I am ok with speed but if you are not clear and enunciate well, I cannot vote for you. I do not like flex prep, I am ok with "K's" however do not assume I know where you are going with it. Spell it out. CX is a great way to score additional speaker points. Stylistically, I am a traditionalist (note the grey hair). I prefer you attack the resolution and the argument and not your opponent in a personal way. DEBATE...
I am ok with theory debate but failure in any one part (interpretation, standards, violation, and voter/impact) will cost you the round.
Give me solid voters as to why you should win the round linked to impacts and I am a happy camper.
