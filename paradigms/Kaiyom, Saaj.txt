  I have judged high school debate in LD and PF before so I am experienced, but I am still parent judge. This is my second year judging high school competitive debate.
I prefer no spreading and it is likely in your best interest to not spread because I can't vote for someone I don't understand.
I am ok with policy arguments as long as their function in the debate is clearly explained. If you read a counterplan, tell me why it negates the resolution, and if you make a permutation tell me why that means the aff wins.
Kritiks are also alright as long as they are well explained and not too complex.
I would advise against T and theory unless your opponent clearly deserves to lose. (Even so, if T and theory is really necessary I would have voted against the violator anyway so its just a waste of time). 
Crystalization in the last few speeches is very helpful.
I give speaker points on who I think did the better speaking. I won't give lower than a 26 unless you are unecessarily rude. If you are nice you are looking at around a 28 and being a good speaker adds more to that.
I will not vote for blantantly offensive debaters.

Be clear and be kind.

I will disclose at the request of both debaters.
