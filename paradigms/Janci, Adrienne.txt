  I have judged many rounds of Public Forum debate and Individual Events, but I am new to LD. I would prefer that my rounds be reasonably paced (when in doubt, slow down) and clear, with an emphasis on voting issues and helping me write my ballot. I have very little exposure to debate theory, so you should probably avoid it.
