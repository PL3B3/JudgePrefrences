  GO SLOW!

I am a lay judge. I have three years of judging experience of only slow LD. If you go fast, you will be almost guaranteed to LOSE unless your opponent is going faster, which would be just as unreasonable. If you speak regularly, then I will understand.

Please do not go off-case. Essentially, no plans, counterplans, theory arguments, kritiks, DA's, etc. Just traditional aff case and neg case. I have no experience with these off-case arguments.

The more straightforward, the better. 

In addition, no fast terminology unless you bother to explain it. 

Finally, if you want to emphasize a piece of evidence in each of your speeches, don't just tell me to remember the last name and move on. I will have no idea what the argument is because as a human being, I cannot flow everything down.

Clarity is key 

Good luck. May the best debater win.
