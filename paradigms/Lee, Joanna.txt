  I used to debate for Edgemont for five years, I don't debate anymore, but I am a junior coach at Agape Leaders Prep.

It's YOUR ROUND, not the judges', so I'll vote by your rules, not mine.
I am not biased. I will vote on anything... I mean ANYTHING.
I honestly don't care about the style of debate, as long as the debaters know what they are doing.

Here are some things I check on:
I'm ok with speed as long as you guys are clear. I will tell you when you are unclear in your speech.Don't believe that judges know every single arguments that you are talking about. Some judges do not know even half of the things you are saying. PLEASE EXPLAIN.Be specific and explain specifically why you should win on certain arguments.If you are being rude and offensive, I will call you out, I will critique you, and I will be very angry at you.Please speak clearly on tags...Do whatever you want on cross-x. It's YOUR cx, NOT MINE.Be clear on line-by-line. I consider it really important.Don't spend over a minute jumping stuff to the other team. If it takes over a minute, I WILL count it as a prep time.Last, but certainly not least, have fun and enjoy the round as much as possible.
If you have any questions about the rounds that I judged you, just email me.
