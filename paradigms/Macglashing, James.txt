  Background
I joined the debate team at my high school Urban Science Academy or Westie freshman year moved up to varsity sophomore year went to the National Forensic League nationals my junior and senior year. after graduating I decided to go to northeastern university and major in political science. I decided to judge and help coach a debate team as college started to pile on work i decided to take a break from coaching and just focus on judging when I can.

Debate Philosophy
I will evaluate every argument you throw at me I've seen some crazy stuff and made some crazy stuff my self. as long as you rank them in importance to me and explain why i should vote on particular issue your good. I will not rely on my own knowledge if the arguments carry a lot of weight in the round. the only thing I really don't like are Critical Affirmatives.

Speed
I have no problem with speed as long as the taglines are clear 


Theory and Framework
Im not really a fan of theory arguments if thats what your good at go ahead use them but in general I find it hard for me to vote for a team that doesn't explain in great detail the importance of the theory arguments. I don't mind Framework and T i actually like T. 

Last Words
I like everything except K-Affs and theory
