  Experience
 I debated PF and participated in extemp for Sarasota High School for three years. I have a working knowledge of progressive LD and am okay with traditional LD but will most likely be judging PF.
Generally, I don’t feel like PF judges need to have paradigms, but the way this event evolved has turned it into such a diverse event that debaters must adapt between “old-school” PF and its more intense counterpart. Overall, as a judge, I will be able to adapt to whatever you throw at me in the round.
Argumentation/Voting
 - Warrants are the most important thing to me in the round. None of your claims matter to me unless you warrant it. That being said, do not attempt to play the devil’s advocate and try to justify things like gentrification, racism, sexism, etc.
- Impact calc is the second most important thing in the round to me after warrants. If you don’t weigh in summary/final focus, and the other team does, you are out of hope.
- As is the case with most competent judges, I’ll vote off of the flow.
- Keep theory out of PF.
- If there are holes in your case, I’ll be forced to make assumptions when I’m deciding who to vote for.
- Don’t get into framework/definition debates.
- I’ll call for evidence most rounds- don’t pack up immediately after the 2nd FF.
- If you want me to vote off of anything at all, make sure it’s in the summary. If it’s not in the summary, don’t bother bringing it to the final focus.
Presentation/Speaks
 - Speed isn’t usually an issue that comes up in PF but I’ve seen kids try to spread. Don’t do that in PF, it’s pointless.
- If your speech becomes unclear, I’ll put my pen down and stop flowing.
- Slow down when you get to your taglines/authors/evidence. If I don’t have evidence written down for you claims/warrants on my flow, you’re not going to pick up that arg.
- Don’t be rude or disrespectful, especially to debaters that are clearly new to the event. I will be less likely to vote for you if you come off as an asshole during your attempts to project your dominance.
- Sign post effectively – keep short taglines and number your arguments for me. Keep your arguments in order unless you have reason to do otherwise.
- Don’t waste your time repeating things because you’re trying to fill the speech time – add different layers of analysis to your strongest warrants.
- Crossfire is not a time to speak over each other.
- You’re a 27 until you prove otherwise.
- Brownie points for those that incorporate crossfire content (concessions, etc.) into actual speeches
- If I repeatedly nod at a certain point during summary, you can move on, as it has been flowed thoroughly.
