  I debated for Walt Whitman High School for three years and worked at the National Symposium for Debate this past summer (2014).

I'll evaluate/ vote off any argument as long as its justified. Speed is fine, but I wasn't the greatest flower in high school so be sure to slow down for short analytics, card names, theory interps, etc. I'll say clear if neccessary (but if I find myself yelling clear an excessive amount it will probably hurt your speaks). I never ran Ks/ other critical arguments and don't really like them, but feel free to run them in front of me but just be aware that I have basically zero background in the literature and you need to be very clear about how your argument functions. 

Feel free to ask me any questions before the round!
