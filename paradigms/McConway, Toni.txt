Updated for Apple Valley 2015:

I'm a parent judge from Cy-Fair High School.

I have judged LD before and am mostly familiar with the structure. I'm willing to listen to almost any arguments as long as you can explain them and what I should do with them. Your best bet is to give me a clear weighing analysis and articulate why the argument is important. I won't pretend to flow so slow down, and overviews in rebuttals are nice. If you cut down on the jargon and make logical arguments I am most likely to feel comfortable voting on them. Basically, I am okay with "progressive" arguments as long as you explain them in English, rather than debate terminology.

Please don't:
-make morally repugnant arguments- I will never buy that racism or homophobia is good.
-make me or your opponent uncomfortable or the debate space feel unsafe.
-argue with me or pressure me to disclose after the round
I probably won't vote for you and/or dock your speaks if you do these things.

Good luck and have fun! Feel free to ask me any further questions before the round.
