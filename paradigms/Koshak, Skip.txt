  Basic Overview

I am a strict LD constructionist.
I am looking for solid Standards Framework consisting of a logical, relevant Value that is clearly demonstrated by a Value Criterion.
Definitions and Observations are welcome as long as they provide clarity. Your task is to take me on a journey to a specific destination. A journey is helped along by Roadmaps and Signposts.

Clash
The purpose of spending time together is education. Education is illuminated by clash. Pointing out stark contrasts between positions is a hallmark of excellent debate. Note: Clash does not infer disrespect. I am more inclined to align with a respectful style given equal positions.

Speed
I prefer quality over quantity and often remind competitors that they are not in a CX round.

Experience
I have judged on local circuit in Houston, TX and New Orleans, LA. I have judged in State Tournaments, NFL Regionals and NFL Grand Tournaments.

Points
Generally range 26-30 and take into account demonstration of respect for opponent and process.

Theory and Critique
My default position is that the framers of the resolution knew what they were doing and that the subject, as stated, is appropriate for LD. I am open to any argumentation, but it has to tie back to something I can weigh against.
