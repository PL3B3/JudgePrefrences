  My son is a varsity competitor. I have not judged on the national circuit, but I have judged several LD rounds over the last two years. I come from a very traditional league so more progressive LD styles will not do as well with me (spreading, theory, Ks, plans). I will give the victory to the side that best upholds his or her value and side. All arguments must link to the value to really matter for me.
