  Typically judges for Collegiate School (NY) or Harrison High School (NY)

This is my second year judging, however I have shadowed my girlfriend, Elysia Segal, at a number of tournaments. My judging style is virtually identical to hers (with the exception of speed) so feel free to read her profile for clarifications.
I tend to be more of a traditional judge. I know what you're thinking "Oh my God a traditional judge with a paradigm?". Yep. I'm traditional and I know how to operate a computer (I know, it's like finding a unicorn). Don't spread, I hate it. You're out of breath, I have completely meaningless phrases on my flow... it just doesn't work out for anyone.Sign posting, weighing, overviews and voters will definitely help you. I'm still relatively new so if your case goes over my head I'm probably not going to pick you up.Don't run theory unless your opponent is being blatantly abusive. I won't vote on presumption.I am very laid back and don't mind if you sit or stand.If you have a speech/stuttering issues let me know (trust me I get it, more than you think). Debate should be an activity you feel comfortable with and learn from, not an exercise in making you feel awkward.
