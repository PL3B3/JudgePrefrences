  Experience
I debated LD for 4 years in South Dakota.

How I vote
I'll vote ultimately for arguments presented in the round. I look first to a Resolutional Analysis (if one is presented) this frames the round and establishes the burdens for the debate. Next I'll look to Value/Criterion (if supplied) here please warrant why I should use your framework and do not just define how it works. Then I look at the Arguments, and Evidence presented in the contention level.

Framework
I prefer if there is a value and criterion.
It is okay if the debate comes down to impacts as long as your value/criterion also support this and you can explain why we're looking at impacts in the first place.

Delivery
For speed, I don't want it to be as fast as policy, but should be much quicker than a conversational speed. If you're going to speak fast please be clear and organized, also slow down to make sure I can catch tags and burdens presented.
Standard LD jargon is acceptable but I really prefer not to have policy jargon in LD rounds.

Voters: please tell me what issues to vote on and provide voters or crystallization in the last speech. These voters or at least the last speech should include points about the framework, value and criterion.

Argumentation
Cross-Applying and extending arguments are fine but explain why extending it is connected to the round and why it matters. Also make the arguments for me, don't expect me to connect it all if you haven't explained how you win.

Theory
I do not really like theory especially if it is really generic or doesn't relate to the resolution.
