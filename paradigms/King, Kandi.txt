  I am a pretty traditional LD judge -- at the very least, this is the LD that I "grew up" teaching and coaching. Having said that, I am also absolutely as non-interventionist as I can be because I do not ever want to be a silent "third" debater in a round. So, yes, I will listen to non-traditional arguments and LD structures, but I strongly urge you not to run them in front of me if you can prevent doing so.

The most important element each of you who are reading this (and deciding how to pref me) is this: I don't flow rounds anymore. I will try to take notes in the form of flowing the major stuff, but I cannot flow the spread debate and won't even try. This is not because I don't like speed (although I find it counterintuitive to what I believe LD ought to be), but because I physically can't keep up.

I will listen carefully and make the best decision I can, but you need to know also I have only judged one round this year. (and I want to applaud those two young people who did an incredibly job of adapting to me!!) I listen to rounds when my students practice so I am somewhat familiar with some positions, but I do not feel comfortable or confident in my knowlege of the topic for this year's TOC.

Having said all this, I have been a part of the LD community since its inception. . . if that makes me a dinosaur, then so be it!!
