  I have judged at several North East tournaments over the past 2 years. 

Please do not speak quickly in front of me. I enjoy debates at conversational speed. I will not say clear. I enjoy debates centered around topical clash. I do not like voting on non-substantive issues such as theory. I assign speaker points based on how persuasive you are. Do not expect me to vote for you if you will not adhere to these guidelines.
