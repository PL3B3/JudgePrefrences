  Hi my name is Olivia! I am a college student from New Jersey. I did both both LD and PF debate in high school.

As a judge, I like arguments that are well warranted and clearly communicated. I prefer traditional frameworks with a value/value criterion over things like plans, DAs, and kritiks. I can understand speed if you speak clearly, however, I will be more much inclined to give you high speaker points if you build comprehensive arguments in the time you are allotted without having to resort to talking extremely quickly.

My thoughts on theory:
I like don't theory. You do not learn anything useful from running theory. Do not run or bait theory because you think you have a better chance at winning theory than arguments that actually have something to do with the resolution. If you do that, I will give you very low speaker points :( The only time you should run theory is if your opponent is being extremely abusive. And even then, do not use theory as your main argument. Just give me a few reasons why they're being unfair, and then continue on talking about the resolution.

Please always be kind and respectful towards each other during the round. I know tournaments can be really competitive, but don't forget to have fun, learn new things, and make friends!
