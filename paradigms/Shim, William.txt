  New to judging, very traditional. 

BE VERY CLEAR. 

I probably will not understand a lot of the jargon, so please do not assume I know anything. 

For example, I may understand the concept of a framework, but not if you just say "the framework is ___." Please ask anything you want clarification on before the round.
