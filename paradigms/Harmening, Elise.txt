  I have 10 years of experience with debate. I debated policy for one year in high school and switched to public forum. I was an IHSA State Champion in public forum in 2008. I continued to judge through college and now law school. I am now the coach for the Homewood-Flossmoor team.

I like to see a clean round. Road maps should be straightforward and followed. Road maps should be continued throughout whether or not you need to make a change. Clearly indicate where you are otherwise the point may be lost. I look at each round in a vacuum but by the end of the season I expect more from each team than at the beginning of the year.

I can hear and flow any speed but prefer a pause after each tag. The quantity of arguments means nothing to me but quality is everything. Theory arguments are ok, but they must be warranted in the round as something outrageous. Otherwise stick with the meat and content of the round as opposed to the semantics of the rules.

Tell me who wins at the end. Understand what the round comes down to and tell me why you won. I donâ€™t care why you think the other side lost but rather the strengths of your own side.
