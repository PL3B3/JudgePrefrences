  In the short, I’m a TABS judge. Do you, run arguments that you have prepped and enjoy.But in order to do that here are a couple of things you should know. My background is 4 years of high school debate in Wisconsin and 2 years of college debate in Georgia.


Disads: Of course you can run disads in front of me.

Counterplans: I love them.

Kritiks: I won’t claim to be well-read in Kritical literature, but I do have some background with running them. Kritiks shouldn’t be run to confuse the other team because they are a competitive option.

Theory: If you’re going to just read through your camp theory block and not cater it to the round, then don’t read it!

Multiple Conditional Worlds: If done wrong, it can either make the round very messy or have too much overlap. In this context(high school debate) it’s NOT ok. Just because your favorite college debater has told you stories of running 2 Ks and 3 CPs doesn’t mean you should do it.

Framework: Explain why your framework is better for debate.

Performance: I haven’t ran it before but I do like it and have voted for it in the past. However, reading a plan text in front of me makes me assume you will do some type of action.
