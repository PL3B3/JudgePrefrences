  I debated for four years at Westlake High School in Austin, TX on the national circuit and went to the TOC twice. I've coached and judged since I graduated in '09.

Feel free to advocate for any type of route to the ballot. I do not assume a truth-testing or comparative worlds or offense-defense or structural oppression/role of the ballot or any other approach to the resolution or the round. I'm happy to hear arguments for and under any of those frameworks. If there is no explicit paradigmatic debate, I will adjudicate within whichever paradigmatic framework both debaters seem to be using. If not, I'll adjudicate based on whichever framework wins.

Theory
I do not assume anything in the theory debate, just as I try not to assume the truth of arguments in any other part of the round. For example I do not assume for or against fairness and education being voters or RVIs. You are welcome to argue for or against any of these things and other parts of the theory debate. I don't subject theory or T arguments to a personal BS test (unless you tell me to). I'll vote on your theory argument (or other arguments in the round) even if I think they're wrong or bad.

Stylistic
Your cases should have clear internal organizational structure. Use numbers/letters/contentions/subpoints to make your case as clear and easy-to-flow as possible.

Have fun and feel free to ask me more questions before the round.
