I am a third year out studying at UT Dallas.

 I debated in LD for four years at Strake Jesuit on both the national and local levels.

I will try to be tab to the best of my ability, and I will not exclude any arguments, styles, or tactics on face. However, in regard to Theory, I felt during my tenure that it was frequently run to take advantage of a less experienced opponent or simply as a time suck with no legitimate claim to abuse. Given such, I will reduce speaker points unless there is clear proof of abuse given in the round. I would like to think I am relatively well read in regards to philosophy and as such have no issue with complex or non-standard argumentation .I appreciate being given a clear decision rule (i.e. Why you win), as that greatly reduces the amount of work I have to do for either side rather than evaluating competing, poorly warranted claims without a basis for comparison.

On the subject of speed, I have no problem with it. However, please keep in mind that itâ€™s been a few years since I debated every weekend and that I might not be as fast as I used to. Finally, please avoid being unnecessarily rude. Above all this is your activity. Good luck.
