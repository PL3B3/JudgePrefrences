  Me: I graduated from UCSD with a degree in neuroscience. I currently work as a neuroscientist at Stanford. I debated on both the national and local circuits for 4 years in high school.

Judge Philosophy: I'm pretty open to types of ideas presented in the round, but think there needs to be a clear baseline mechanism by which to way these ideas (whether that be the value structure, a priori argumentation for theory, etc.) This means that if the implication of a theory argument is supposed to be a reason to reject the debater, there needs to be a clear elucidation of why that is the case and why the argument is evaluated pre-standards. I think weighing is a lost art in debate. 

I can flow some speed, but its been a while, so I will say clear if I can't understand you. 

I have no problem giving very high or very low speaks. Don't be rude for the sake of being rude. Being creative and smart as a debater will definitely get you more speaks than putting down your opponent. I know debate is a competitive activity, but that does not give you permission to be a jerk. 

Feel free to ask me any specific questions you might have before the round.
