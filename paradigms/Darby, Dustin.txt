Topicality/ Theory- I have no problem voting on theory or topicality if it is well warranted. I am unlikely however to vote on cheap shot theory arguments \ were little to no warrants are presented example “condo-vote strat skew and education”.

D/A- I like these debates. I default to an offense/defense paradigm but I think an aff can win on defense alone if they making arguments about why having to have offense is bad. The more specific the disad to the aff the better. 

CP- I enjoy cp debates the most. I will vote on almost any cp if you can win that it is theoretically legitimate and that it has a net benefit.

Kritiks/K Affs- This is a literature base I am finding myself more immersed in. I have no problem with teams running untopical affs as long as they can win that it’s good to do so. I often vote vote on framework though I would prefer a more specific strategy to the affirmative being presented.
