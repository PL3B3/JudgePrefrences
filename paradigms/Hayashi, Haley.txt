Policy Info (Updated 1/23/16)

I competed in policy debate for all of high school. Since I have been in college I have judged policy, congress, LD and PF. So far I have judged at 2 tournaments on the policy surveillance topic; so my knowledge of the topic is limited.

If there is something you would like clarification on or if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

-Speed is fine, if I cannot understand you I will say clear. I flow on my computer when judging (usually), so if you are unclear to the point where I cannot understand it you will not hear me typing. 
-Try to be amicable to each other. Excessive rudeness will not only annoy me,but will cost you speaker points.
-I don’t count flashing as prep, but don’t abuse that.
-I am open to listening to different kinds of debates, but just a disclaimer that my high school experience was primarily in policy style debate.
-Ks: I think Ks can be interesting and lead to good debates but I am not an expert so you will need to go heavy on explanations and light on jargon.
-Ts, CPs, and Das: All good arguments to run in front of me. Ts: Make sure to impact your arguments. Counter interpretations are good.

-Theory/FW: Needs to be contextualized and clearly articulated why it is important enough to vote on and what the in round abuse is.

LD
-I have judged a few rounds of Varsity/circuit LD, but I don't have extensive experience with LD.
