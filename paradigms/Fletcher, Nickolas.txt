  Please know that I would leave this page blank if I could. You should debate any way that you feel is going to win the round.

All is fair in love and war.
In debate, there are no rules. You are encouraged to play the game as you see fit. Get creative.

That being said: I will vote on anything. Anything. Tell me what is most important in the round and why. Carry it through every speech.

I am a policy debater, therefore, I lean policy and like a good T debate. Explain your interps. 
Remember impact calc on everything. Especially your procedurals.
I prefer an alt or advocacy on the K, but again, play the game you want.
Clash in CX is only useful if you use it during the speech. I will not evaluate anything from CX unless you tell me to.

Timekeeping
You should keep time of your speeches, prep, and CX. You should be keeping your opponents to their time constraints as well. In rugby, the game clock is always running. The same should be applied to debate. CX begins immediately after a speech ends. Prep begins immediately after CX ends. You may continue your CX into your prep, but the other team is not obligated to answer beyond 3 mins.

Prep
It is up to you to keep track of your prep time. You should also keep the other team accountable for being fair with transferring files. 

FW/ROB
Don’t leave the decision up to me—it is up to you to tell me how to frame the round and what to do with my ballot.

My name is Nick. I am your peer, not your superior.
In debate, education is paramount. All other standards and reasons-to-prefer pale in comparison.
There are man things to be nervous about, but a debate round should not be one of them.
