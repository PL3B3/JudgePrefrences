  Megan Vujica's Judge Philosophies
LD:
My main interest is in clarity. You are all in debate so I assume that you know how to clash and will actually put forth an argument. What tends to be lacking in many debaters is clarity. To explain what I mean by that I have four points that need to be satisfied.
Clarity means that speed is earned. Do not speed if you cannot make each word distinct from the others around it and therefore have me understand what you are saying. I cannot judge you based upon what I do not understand therefore you will get voted down. Do not spread.Clarity means highlighting your taglines. Therefore your taglines should be separated from the rest of your speech, especially if you are using speed. If you don't understand what I mean by this ask me in round.Clarity means being organized. Not just in your constructive cases, which since you all know how to write an argument are already organized, but in your rebuttals. If you are making an argument against your opponent's contention 1 subpoint c tell me so. Don't expect me to know where to put the argument on the flow and just throw out arguments.Clarity means summarizing and condensing. The affirmative's last speech should be solely based on the main arguments over the course of the debate and voters (clearly labeled as such), not the whole flow. The negatives last 1-3 minutes of their rebuttal speech should go to the same.If one of these points are missing then you will lose speaker points if not the round. This is what is necessary for me to consider your argument for winning. As far as what will get you the win, this is a philosophical style of debate. I expect you to debate philosophy and ethics and morals.
