  I am a lay judge who was been judging mostly LD since my high school daughter began competing in 2011. I have never debated and I take LD ballots every chance I get. I much prefer LD rounds to the judges’ room, and I’ve been known to judge 8-10 rounds per tournament.

My philosophy:
Strong, clear, and pertinent links to the V/VC weigh heavily in your favor whether it’s regarding claims, warrants, impacts, or extensions, i.e. tell me why what you’re saying mattersNot every contention is created equal: well supported contentions outweigh numerous, weak, and/or dropped contentionsI’ve been coached by debate students to heavily favor pertinent warrants and clearly articulated impactsGiven equally well presented, supported, rebutted, and defended points (admittedly a rarity), I vote the option that makes the most rational sense in the real worldAny philosophy I studied in school is long lost to everyday life, so I need a clear explanation of more exotic arguments, although I'll find even that ineffective if it's communicated to me or your opponent in a condescending or superior toneAlthough I’ve been highly entertained by a handful of kritiks, I have yet to vote for oneI’m still learning debate jargon and terminology, use with cautionI cannot vote for you if I cannot understand you, so only speak as quickly as you think I can follow (which varies from speaker to speaker, depending on enunciation and inflection); although I will say “clear” or “speed” if you’re losing me, know that speed kills and I won’t say either a second timeClear tags work in your favor, especially during rebuttals when half my battle is identifying which arguments you’re responding to in my flowIt doesn’t take long to get familiar with most arguments after one tournament, so creativity is often rewardedIt is at least as important that *you* understand your argument as it is that I understand your argument, critical thinking is a must and you have a great chance at my vote if you're never caught flat-footed on your own caseVoting points are highly recommended, it is at least as important that *you* know why you’re winning as it is that I know why you’re winningI want to see your face when you’re speaking and not the top of your head, the back of your computer, or the back of your prepared speech; looking and sounding like you actually believe your own argument always helpsI give out a lot of 27s and 28s for speaker points, rarely award 25s and 30s, and I believe argument outweighs presentation so I generally have a low-point win at any given tournament; speed and lack of civility will drop your speaker points as well as your chance at my vote
