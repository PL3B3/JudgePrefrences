  Debated four years for Regis High School. Currently a senior at Harvard College.

Philosophy: use sound reasoning and common sense. As long as debaters articulate their arguments clearly, explain the relevance of each argument to their overall thesis, and defend their positions with convincing logic, they should be fine.
