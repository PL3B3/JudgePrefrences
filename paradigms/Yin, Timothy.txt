PF/LD/IE experience as well as college parli
Showing disrespect for your opponent is perhaps the worst thing you can do in a round. This includes belittling your opponent, being purposefully distracting while they speak, being egregiously late, lying. Debate is meant to be an educational and fun activity. Be mature, be funny, be nice (especially against opponents you are overmatched against).Strong impact calculus/weighing-easiest way to win my ballotDon't go too fast but more importantly be clear in your signposting. As a general rule I can flow at your fastest extemp speed. I will say clear if I cannot understand youKritiks-to be honest I have a distaste for these especially ones that don't clearly engage the case, do not assume I am well read on the literature, most of what I know is from what I hear in tournamentsTheory-open to voting on it but both your links and impacts need to be reasonable and persuasiveDis-Ads-need to be effectively and persuasively impactedI don't think debate can be simply compared to a game, keep in mind I'm primarily a PFer, for LD I'm a fairly traditional judge but I do try to judge rounds on the flowI lean on the high side of assigning speaks, but it depends on the tournamentI think debate should be about persuasiveness over technicality-I am interested more in your ability to analyze issues and craft arguments than in how much evidence you've found or how macarny you can read off Ask me anything before round, always happy to disclose and provide feedback afterwards
