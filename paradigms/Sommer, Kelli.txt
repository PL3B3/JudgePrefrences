  I support the idea of a standard, traditional LD round. Strong evidence is half the battle, but analysis and argument make up the other half and can make or break a round. Additional note about evidence: sources should be timely and relevant, as well as reliable. In the end, a balance of solid, credible evidence and thoughtful analysis makes for a powerful round. Debate structure falls first to values; LD is a debate of values, after all. Please crystallize voter issues and impact. I look for mastery of textbook structure. Please keep voices at a comfortable register and be cordial. I appreciate a bit of humor, wit, and sarcasm but not in a way that's nasty or rude.
Spewing does not impress me if you mumble or trip over words; not only does the debater risk speaker points, but losing the argument in their unintelligibility. When in doubt, speak quickly and clearly and feel free to repeat tags for the flow.

Looking forward to an excellent tournament!
