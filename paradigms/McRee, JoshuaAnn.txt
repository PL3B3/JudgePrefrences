  I am JoshuaAnn McRee from Smithville High School.
I was alternate for state in Lincoln Douglas Debate and have a background in Cross Examination, Parliamentary, and Public Form Debate.

Judging philosophy:

1. Speed. I have no problem with spreading as long as the speech can be clearly understood.
2. In general, arguments must be coherent. I will evaluate anything with a good warranted explanation.
3. Topicality Dont run them as a time suck. If there is a clear violation I will vote on it, but must weigh standards.
4. Kritik Im not fluent with Critical literature so if ran must provide a concise explanation.
5. Dis Ads. I prefer DAs to Ks
6. Counter Plans. I have no problem with CPs however, make sure to have a clear voting issue.
