  So. First a couple of things about my judging experience-
I'm a parent judge affiliated with Los Alamos High School in New Mexico. My judging experience has been mostly in state with very few national rounds.
Now about what I look for in a round-
I am of the opinion that debate should be a persuasive activity and thus I would like to see slower style.
I'm also pretty traditionalist- values and criteria are really important to how I weigh a round and I'm not fluent enough in critical or policy style argumentation to give you a fair decision.
So if you run those arguments, don't rank me very highly.

Grab-Bag-
If you run arguments I've told you not to, your speaker points will drop quickly. The same is true if I can't understand you when you speak- either too quickly or into your computers.
I will not tolerate rude, racist, or sexist behavior in the round. If I see any of these, I will give you a loss 20. I prize logic and speaking eloquence.
