  I did debate for roughly three years in high school. I leathered and achieved Excellence my first year. In my second year, I reached Distinction. My main focus was LD debate, and I have competed in Fort Bend’s district meet. I also briefly did Congress and some Poetry & Prose.

I believe that in LD, it’s about who upholds their value the most during the round. I flow everything in an LD round, so I don’t miss much. A winner should be one that clearly states their case, supports evidence that relates to their contentions, and proves how that connects and upholds their value. They should not make up evidence or put words in their opponent’s mouth. They should not state a drop contention, if in fact it wasn't; this always tells me that they just missed the opponent's argument.
