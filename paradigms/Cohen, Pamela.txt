  I am a policy-oriented judge, and do not vote based on standard stock issues. I take notes, but I don't flow fast debate. I vote on what has been crystallized in the round, and on which team has best articulated how its position will be most beneficial. I don't vote on kritiks, so don't run one. Counterplans are fine, as long as they're well-articulated and have clear net benefits. I will rarely vote on theory, unless there is clear in-round abuse. I will judge based on the entire debate, but in the last two speeches I want you to tell me exactly why you won.
