  Lay judge. I don't want to hear the debaters spewing at 300 words per minute, I prefer a slightly faster than conversational pace. No, I do not want to be part of an email chain. No, I do not like the recent trend in LD of kritiks and theory and other policy jargon. I like a strong value and criterion debate with both debaters using persuasive speaking skills.
