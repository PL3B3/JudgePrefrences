My preferences are very simple--I like good arguments. The only things in debate that are not debatable are the speech and prep times. I have a fairly high threshold for theory. Kritiks are cool. Disads require specific links, internal links, and justified impacts (don't run generic camp crap--Mead '92 is a horrible impact card and you should feel bad for using it). I tend to give leniency to the affirmative on Topicality. As a negative team, give me some sort of counter-advocacy to the case--kritik or counterplan. PICs must have specific solvency evidence for the affirmative case.
Line-by-line argumentation is a necessity. Keep the round organized.
