  I am a parent judge with experience judging at local and national tournaments at the varsity levels. My daughter competes for West Broward FL in LD and this is her third year. My judging philosophy is simple. I believe that an ordinary citizen should be able to listen to the reasoned arguments of two debaters and come to a logical conclusion as to who's argument and evidence is more persuasive. I prefer arguments to be well structured, articulated clearly (please no spreading but I can handle a little faster then conversational) and supported by convincing evidence.

Plans- I'm ok with basic topical plan texts, but nothing non-topical
Counter-plans- I'm okay with cps but perms confuse me when it's not explained to me thoroughly 
Ks- not familiar with them and not super keen on them in round 
DAs- I am perfectly fine with them just again be clear and concise 

Please ask questions if more clarification is neededðŸ˜€
