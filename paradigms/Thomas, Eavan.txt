As a debater, I lean more towards policy. However, I can appreciate kritical args as well. I do not like to do work for EITHER team. Just because I said I am more policy oriented does not mean that you can do less analysis on that front. I expect thorough overviews...tell me the story, don't leave out the in-between steps. I will vote on pretty much anything if you make me believe it....be passionate.

I expect a high level of respect towards your opponents and partner. Cross x should be a mature questioning in which you maintain control. High speaker points are earned.

Over all, just do what you do best. Stick with the old reliables. It may seem washed up to you, but I will prefer seasoned experience and knowledge over experimentation any day. Lastly, do try to remember to have fun!
