  I have over eight years of experience as a debater at the state and national level and 27 years of experience as a debate coach. I am very familiar w/ policy debate (NDT), values  debate(CEDA), and LD..
Likes: signposting, smart tags, solid evidence/links, well constructed arguments, and good speakers (yes…the “best of the best” are not only good debaters, but good speakers!!!)
Dislikes: incomprehensible speed, vague Kritiks with no application, non-competitive CPs, fiat abuse, and unsupported A-Spec arguments, generic DAs (no links), and squirrels.
