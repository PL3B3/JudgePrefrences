Please be funny

Short Version-
Clash and impact calculus are lacking in debates. Do it more.
Defense is under utilized.
I like specific strategies over generics.
Don’t change your strategy because I’m judging. I will vote for who wins. Go with what your good at.
Truth means nothing, technique is more important.

Side Note-
I do enjoy theory debates if done well; I very much enjoy these types of discussions. If your not going to do it well though it will just lower your points. You should probably slow down and be sure to impact your argument. I would prefer if you had an interpretation/counter interpretation and structured your 2NR/2AR in that fashion. Don’t use the word “abuse” too liberally.
I think most things aren’t really voting issues, more reasons to reject the argument.

I will not vote on bad theory arguments (“Cheap Shots”) just because they are dropped. If the 1AR doesn’t answer severance perms bad (even if he/she does extend the perm) I will give him/her leeway until the 2AR.
