  I consider myself as a judge a legistative decision maker. That is I weigh policy alternatives. While I understand that debate is a academic exercise I do not like argument that move to far away from real world choices. Speaking fast is ok, spreading to the point that a careful listener cannot understand you defeats the purpose of oral argumentation.
