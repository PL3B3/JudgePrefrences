  I have been an assistant coach and Debate 1 teacher for the past two years. While I have judged some novice LD, I am new to the event and am less interested in technicalities than I am in solid arguments that reflect creativity and solid research. As I am a "novice" judge, I need to hear clear connections between the claim, value and criterion. Everything should clearly link. Quality of evidence is crucial; I definitely want to hear WHY the evidence you chose supports your specific arguments. It's probably best to avoid k cases with me, especially if you're spreading, as I will probably get lost. Make sure that you are clear, you enunciate, and your arguments are better than your opponents, and you should win! 

One other note: during cross ex, make sure to "locate" your opponent's argument so that it is clear to me which you are attacking. 

I look forward to getting more well-versed in this event and in hearing some amazing debate.
