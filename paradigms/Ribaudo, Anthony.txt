  Time debating: Three years in Lincoln Douglas and Public Forum, plus three years in college policy.

Schools attended: Clark High School (You might also want to scratch me from Canyon Springs rounds too)

Number of years judged: Four years




Philosophy:
I'm fine with most forms of debate. Traditional-style LD, or the more Policy-esque disad/counterplan/kritik versions are both fine with me.

I hold a high value for argument comparisons. Impact calculus, evaluating an opponent's evidence, and simply using reasoning to say an opponent's evidence is wrong holds weight with me. When I'm in a deadlock, a good impact calculus can have huge weight with me.

Speed: I'm alright with speed. However, to be on the safe side, I would suggest slowing down on your tags and any extremely key arguments, i.e.: if your entire round hinged on the fact that your opponent was wearing a blue tie, don't blip through that in two seconds, just to be on the safe side.

Anything performative, i.e.: irony, performance, a personal narrative: I wouldn't bother. Rounds like that tend to get messy, and I have no way of evaluating it at that point.
