  Experienced LD debater, fairly progressive. Did LD for 4 years in HS, and spent some time coaching a parliamentary team in college. I now coach my local LD team as a side hustle. 

I vote off flow, not for the best debater. If I'm put in the position where I have to vote based off something ridiculous, but the decision is clear off the flow, I'll vote for the ridiculous stuff. Make sure you cover all of your opponents case to avoid such problems. I think the role of the judge is to be as Tabula Rasa as possible. That said I am open to pretty much any kind of argument you can make, Ks, Theory, ROB, etc.

I will admit I have a soft spot for troll cases, though again, I'll look to the flow.

Speed: A lot of people who try to spread can't do it well. Remember to pause and state the tags of your cards, contentions, subpoints, VCs, etc. Granted, now that its normal for judges to ask for cases before the round starts, this makes things a bit easier. Just don't spit words like a rusty machine gun and we should be okay.

Flex prep is fine.

Have fun.
