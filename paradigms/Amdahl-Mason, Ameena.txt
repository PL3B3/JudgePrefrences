  I competed in policy debate in high school and I have been coaching since 2001. I would consider myself a tabula rasa judge, as much as that is possible. I have judged many rounds on this topic, and I feel comfortable with any line of argumentation. However, I do not appreciate rudeness, including cursing, either between or among teams. Evidence exchange counts as a part of your prep time. I want you as debaters to provide me with compelling reasons why you should win the debate. Generic argumentation, weak links, and time sucks are not appreciated.
