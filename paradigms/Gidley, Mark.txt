  I was a policy debater for four years in high school and four years in college for the University of Kansas in the 1970s and 1980s. I have judged and coached LD for the past three years.

I am okay with speed as long as debaters remain clear and articulate. I am fine with policytype arguments in LD. Very theoretical positions are acceptable, but do not expect me to have a thorough understanding of your literature. Explanation and examples will be important for me to understand and be persuaded by the latest theory arguments.
