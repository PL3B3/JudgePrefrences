  As a parent who has no experience in debating or coaching, when judging public forum I prefer debaters to stay away from using jargon, as PF was originally created as a lay event therefore I should be able to understand the round without previous knowledge on public forum or on the resolution. In a round I will vote off of the team that clearly presents their voting issue in a form of a weighing mechanism. I look for weighing and analysis when it comes to impacts. The team that gives me the easiest way and the more straight forward way to vote while quantifying and comparing their impacts will win the round. In the final focus I would like to see extensions, however don't just tell me to extend explain the warrant behind it.
