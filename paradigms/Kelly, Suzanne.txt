  Edit me! 

I have been an NFL coach and judge for over seven years at Vanguard College Preparatory School.  I have been the mother of a varsity debater and I debated (years ago) when we only had policy debate offered at my high school.  
As for judging paradigms:
I maintain old-fashioned paradigms for Lincoln -Douglas.  I believe it should remain a philosophical, rather than evidence-based debate, backed up by logic and good reasoning. I still want to hear how the value is supported by the criterion, rather than being bombarded by a CX style amount of evidence.
I would describe myself as a stock issue judge in CX or Policy debate, but I am open to other forms of argumentation.  I can handle some speed (our TFA is famous for that), but not when I cannot understand the speaker.
My son's team finished among the top dozen at the Atlanta Nationals in 2003 so Public Forum Debate is still a favorite of mine.  Ted Turner originated this style to emulate Cross Fire on television. I look for good argumentation, logic, reasoning and a persuasive speaking style.
