  [Created 01.06.15 for the Churchill Tournament]

Debate History- I am a first-year student at Sarah Lawrence College. I debated for 4 years at Salado High School, competing at LD in the UIL and TFA circuits for four years, NFL and TOC circuits for three years (sophomore through senior year), and my senior year I competed in UIL CX debate. I qualified to TFA state three years and broke to double-octofinals my senior year. I debated at multiple TOC tournaments, and debated in a bid round at St. Marks. I also won UIL CX 2A State my senior year.

Speed- I have no problem with speed; if you speak at a rate that I cannot understand I will say "clear" as many times as necessary without any penalty on your speaker points. A slower rate on intricate arguments such as theory interps would be appreciated.

Theory- I'll always evaluate theory. I would prefer to adjudicate theory arguments as the debaters tell me to, but absent specification I will default to competing interpretations, dropping the debater, and RVIs for "I meets" and "counter-interps." I would like to see theory debate held to the same standard as all other debate, with high levels of clash and weighing.

Pre-standards and a-priori arguments- I like these to be clearly labeled and I want you to articulate why they come first and are independent reasons to vote for you.

Speaker Points- I will base these on how much I like your strategy in the round. Clashing warrants, weighing, and extending more than tag-lines will also raise your speaker points. I'll also give you higher speaker points if your case is interesting/unique.

Other- I will evaluate pretty much any type of arguments, including kritiks, disads, plans and counter-plans, micro-political arguments, role of the ballot arguments, or pre-fiat arguments. If you think there is anything I might have a problem evaluating, just ask before the round and I will clarify my position.
