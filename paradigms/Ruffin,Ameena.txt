  I currently debate for Towson University and am an assistant policy debate coach at Baltimore City College. I debated, for two years—11th and 12th grades—for Baltimore City College High School.


I'm a kritical debater but, as far as my preferences go, I prefer if debaters do whatever they prefer. 

If the K is what you like, do that; give me a links and impacts and tell me how those impacts interact with everything else going on in the round. If you like politics, again, give me links and impacts; I'll vote on it. A good 2AR/2NR tells me how I vote and why I vote that way. 

An argument conceded is an argument won by the opposing team--unless I'm told otherwise.

Framework comes first--unless debaters tell me otherwise.

Don't leave me to decide whether T or condo comes first. Unlike many, I have no standing opinions about these things, not because I haven't spent time thinking about them, but because I don't believe there is always a definite answer to the question of which comes first. T comes first if the Neg wins that it does; condo comes first if the Aff wins that it does. 

In general, don't leave me to my own devices as my opinions on certain arguments tend to occasionally shift or be somewhat different than the norm. Tell me how to vote and I'll vote.


I’M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE THE ROUND AND/OR YOU CAN EMAIL ME: ameena.ruffin@gmail.com
