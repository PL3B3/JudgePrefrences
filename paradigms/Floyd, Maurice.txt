If I am saying things in the order of priority the first is that I will not rep out. I don’t care who are you are entering the room I only care about what you say. I coached Jalon Alexander from the Bodine High school of International Affairs. He qualified to the Tournament of Champions twice, winning various speaker awards and Quarter finalist at the NDCA Tournament.
Speed- To keep it simple I don’t like it. Combined I have judged ,and watched over 100 rounds these last 2 seasons so I definitely can keep up. That being said I don’t want to hear it. In the status quo it’s spoken at incomprehensible speeds. I don’t have time for that. I refuse to hear individuals rhythmically sound like they are choking themselves take it somewhere else.
Strategy- Debaters that earn 30s in my book execute strategies that clearly explain how I can easily sign my ballot their way. Explain why an argument in your case makes their case or argument irrelevant. Use effective grouping extremely simple.
Theory- I don’t want any of that, debate the topic. If a case is abusive explain why it is, without the shell and move on…. Literally you will win my ballot by winning via the topic, not off an abusive cry.
Case arguments- Nothing morally repugnant I, E- Racism good, skepticism, Sexism etc…
If you wish to run an argument that criticizes the nature or environment of the activity, due so at your own risk. I will be an active listener to the argument if you do it well. However, running it because I’m familiar with it and not because you wish to go all in is a quick way to a loss. Be real..
At the end of the day I want to see clash. Style and presence enjoy the activity.
