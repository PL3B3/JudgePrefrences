I am a Registered Nurse with a Masters Degree of Science in Nursing. I manage registries that keep track of children that have had surgeries and interventioinal cardiology procedures, done to their hearts. I use this data to improve care to this population. We also evaluate research and amend our practice base on evidence based findings.

Please use research that clearly supports your contentions, is referenced, and is as current as needed to support your point. Please objectively define terms.

Basics
1. Be respectful and civil.
2. Speak slowly and make your points clearly.
3. Take care to follow-up on points as indicated.
