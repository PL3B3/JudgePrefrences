  Judge Philosophy - Kayla Rowe
Four Years LD debate at The Meadows School

I like persuasive arguments that clash.  Lots of weighing yay!! 

I do not like theory that much but will look to it if you weigh it to the importance of the round.  

I am fine with speed as long as you slow down for tag lines and speak clearly.
