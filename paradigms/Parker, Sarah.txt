  Debated 3 years at Central High School in Little Rock. Attending Northwestern ('15) but not debating.

Though I attend Northwestern University, I’ll always be a Southern belle at heart. So I value the kind of respect and courtesy that go along with Southern hospitality. There’s a fine line between making a point and being rude, crude or socially unattractive. This also means I expect you to call me “ma’am” or “Miss Parker” in-round, not “judge” or “Sarah."

Generally, I would prefer to adjudicate a counterplan/disadvantage or disadvantage/case strategy as opposed to a critique debate. This is not to say I won’t vote on the critique, but it will probably require a bit more explanation in front of me. I’d rather you go for a well-developed critique than a poor counterplan or disadvantage. I believe that counterplans that claim competition off the certainty and/or immediacy of the plan are not competitive. It’s unlikely I’ll vote on conditionality if the negative reads 2 or less non-contradictory advocacies. I expect the affirmative to read a topical plan. If you think the plan fails to meet the resolution, go for topicality. I default to competing interpretations. However, if you go for topicality against a reasonable aff, I’ll likely be sympathetic to the affirmative.

One more thing you should know is that no one should use the term “civil war” in front of me. Please use the term “war of northern aggression.” Even if you are not referring to the War of Northern Aggression that occurred from 1861-1865, I’d rather you use this term than “civil war.” There was nothing civil about it.
