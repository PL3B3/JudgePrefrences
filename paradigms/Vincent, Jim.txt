  Judging Experience: I have judged policy debate for six years. During that time I have judged at tournaments throughout northwest Indiana as well as three district tournaments. At the 2012 national NFL tournament held in Indianapolis, I judged five rounds, including an octafinal round (round 12). I am a parent who has had two varsity debaters in the program and have earned a master's degree in communications and have taught speech communication on the college level.

Judging Philosophy: I believe all five stock issues are important but believe that advantages versus disadvantages of a plan bear special attention. In that sense I am a policymaker. In a close round, when one or more disadvantages go unchallenged or seem especially applicable or likely, I would lean toward maintaining the status quo. I do not like heavy speed (on a scale of 1-10, with 10 meaning most rapid speed of delivery, I would be a "3") because unlike the debaters, I will not have immediate access to cards and key wordings. I do not like K (criterion) arguments because they change the focus and can even shift the debate topic to a heavily philosophical approach that may even redefine the resolution. I can follow K arguments but dislike their impact upon the debate topic.
