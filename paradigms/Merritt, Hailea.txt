I get the notion of "progressive LD", but I don't like it. I want you to have a basic V, VC, Contentional structure to your case, but if you don't and you run something off the wall I can and will flow it. That being said, because this is an LD round I will give your opponent quite a bit of leeway as far as theory and structure arguments go.
I will buy nearly any argument (with the stipulation that there is some logic/warrant to it), but the more "out-there" it is, the more difficult it will be to carry in round.
I believe the debate is in the contentional arguments, but framework, V & VC set the parameters for the round. The round will be judged based on the winning parameters, if you cannot function in the round under those, you will loose, regardless of contentional arguments.
Confidence even a sense of humor in a debater is great, but cockiness, arrogance, rudeness or the like will not help you in one of my rounds and will affect the way I vote.
I can handle speed, but I do give leeway to the opposition, further too fast is too fast. I will stop flowing. Your arguments will be considered new in rebuttals, and thus invalid in round.
Leeway is given to the 1AR, I will let you extend arguments further but no new arguments can be brought up in the 2AR.
Good Luck to All!
