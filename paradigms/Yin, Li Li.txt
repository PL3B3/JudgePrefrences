  My son has been doing LD debate for the past one and a half years and this will be my second time judging in a tournament, with St. Mark's being my first time at a national circuit tournament.

I can't write as fast as other judges, so don't spread in front of me. If I don't get it down on my flow, then I don't evaluate it, and if you try to bring it up later in the round I will ignore it. Go at a conersational pace and try to be as clear as possible; if you're unclear, I'll give you a warning sign the first time, but after that you're on your own.

I'm unfamiliar with theory debate, so don't run theory because I don't know how to evaluate it. Please don't try to run any other off-cases, like topicality, DA's, CP's, or K's, because I'm going to become confused, not vote on it, and will probably lower your speaker points a bit. As you can see, I'm a very lay judge, so if you want to win and get high speaker points in front of me, please debate in a lay fashion.

Framework is okay, but don't try to make it too dense. There's no way that I can completely understand all of deontology in 45 minutes, so be sure to be a "big picture" debater and explain clearly (i.e. with voters) why you win the round so that I won't have to intervene and can vote as soon as possible.

My son has greatly enjoyed his debate experience so far and I have as well. Have fun, be polite to one another, and always make eye contact with me. I'm excited about judging in this tournament,
