  James Payne -- L/D Philosophy. 

As a high school competitor in the 1970's I won awards in extemp, radio, congress, duo, poetry, and impromptu. In college I was president of the Debate Club at IUPUI for a year and finished first in speaker points at both tournaments we attended that year.

I have much more experience in speech than debate, but I'm adept at judging both. This will be my 3rd Blue Key tournament as a judge. 

I like debate rounds that are filled with real-life examples and strong arguments backed by evidence of research. I prefer civil discourse over personal attacks, and I've been known to award losses if I think the rules have been violated or the spirit of the friendly debate has been tampered with in any way. Lincoln-Douglas is a values debate, so please explain to me why I should hold what you value in the debate over your competitor.
