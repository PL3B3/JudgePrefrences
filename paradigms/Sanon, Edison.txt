  I have been judging PF the last two years mainly during invitationals and a few locals in New Jersey. Primarily I coach speech categories and tend to judge PF like a speech round. That said, the following philosphy is what I go by in PF:

Speed: While I understand a speaker's need to put as much information as possible, if I don't understand you, I have to mark you down. Maintain a pace that allows me to understand your arguments clearly.Crossfire: I consider it the most important part of PF and what speakers should focus on the most. Control the crossfire and you control the debate. I find that controlled aggression during questioning and answering stands out for me. While I am not one to hear polite banter during crossfire, I also don't want a lack a civility and a shouting match going on for three minutes. As a personal rule, I allow a speaker to wrap up a thought after a crossfire time has expired. Be respectful and you should win out.Scoring: I don't believe your team score should go below a 25 unless you have demonstrated that you were not prepared for the topic or you brought up a point that you misinterpret and steers away from the resolution.
I tend to keep as much of a poker face during the round. But I am happy to offer what I can for the round but it will likely be what is noted above.
