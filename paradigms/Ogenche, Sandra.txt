  Student at UT Austin, did debate all of high school, first in British Parliamentary, and when I moved to the States briefly did LD, but mostly CX for two years. 

I don't have a particularly rigid philosophy about debate, mostly just a few guidelines and observations from my time in debate. 

Speed: Debate isn't NASCAR racing. I like a fast-paced debate but let's be reasonable in our delivery. I would prefer a clear and concise argument to WPM race any day. I'll let you know if you need to slow down, but just keep it mind. 

Theory: I'm open to pretty much any argument but my brief time in LD has given me some disdain for purely theoretical arguments. Still though, if you're clear and persuasive I can be won over with a good theory. 

Topicality: I'm not a stickler, I'm ok with some creativity in interpretation. However, make sure you have a strong framework or it falls apart completely. 

Have solid evidence but don't barrage me with it. Be clever, be creative -- I appreciate a good Kritik. I don't judge very often, so please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I don't vote on technicalities, I just want to be convinced.
