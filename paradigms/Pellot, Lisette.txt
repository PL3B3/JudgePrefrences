  Previous experience: High School 2014-2015: Participated in a Fall Forensic, Debate 1, Debate2, and debate team/club after school. 

Preference: A contention debate and for debaters to show respect to one another, showing sportsmanship. I hope for debaters to be on time. 

Speaking speeds: No spreading- fast talk. A speed that allows comprehension for everyone in the room and a small amount of time for people to be able to jot things down.
