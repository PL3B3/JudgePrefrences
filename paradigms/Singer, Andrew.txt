  Andrew Singer competed in speech for four years at Millburn High School and is now a student at Emory. He has experience with speech and debate and is open minded about all sorts of arguments, but it would be in your interest to err on the side of over explanation when it comes to complicated analytic/critical philosophy. Avoid excessive jargon and/or speed, and most theory arguments.
