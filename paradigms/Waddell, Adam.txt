  I am primarily a policy judge, but I competed in LD and PF.

CX:
My views of an affirmative in CX should be a policymaker. I just want people to debate the topic, and not crazy wild theory that has nothing to do with the topic. Negative I like to hear on case disads because it shows that you have done your research. If you are going to run a counter plan and disads or other off case arguements, please make sure to explain how the counterplan avoids the other disads that you have brought up. I don't generally like K unless they can really sell them. 95% of K's i've had to listen to are gimmick arguments and never really gain in ground in the round. I can handle speed as much as you can throw at me.

LD:
I can handle just about any argument either way in LD, except I do not want to hear Debate Theory negative in LD. They are dumb and they take us away from the topic.

PF:
Just debate and make good arguments. It shouldn't be any more complicated than that. I can handle speed, and I actually encourage spreading in PF because of limited time constraints to get arguments out.
