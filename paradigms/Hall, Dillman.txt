  I'm currently debating at Westminster - started in 9th grade - currently a junior.

Philosophy: Read anything. Actually anything. Just don't insult me or the opponent. If you talk over your opponent, minus .5 speaks every time.

Debate's I'd be amused watching:
-Wipeout
-K debates
-Theory debates
-Impact turns
-Politics

Be friendly, debate what you'll have fun with, and go team!!

I also give higher than average speaks...unless I call clear or you steal prep. Then I give lower than average.
