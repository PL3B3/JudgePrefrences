  Quick rundown on me: I debated slow policy for four years, public forum (lay and flow) for two years, and did extemporaneous speaking for four years as well. I've never participated in/judged LD. I italicized slow policy because although I did do circuit policy in some tournaments, my vast majority of experience was either lay or medium, and my knowledge of circuit has also diminished in the time since I was in high school. With that said, right off the bat - I'm okay with some spreading, but I would much prefer just fast talking that is clearly enunciated. Please don't try spreading too fast - it's very likely I won't be able to follow, and I'll do my best to convey to you when that happens (probably by putting my pen down or something). Also, please please please enunciate and roadmap.
