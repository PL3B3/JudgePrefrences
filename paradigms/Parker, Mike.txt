  I was in HS debate for 4 years and won 2nd in State 2 years running. I debated in speach/debate at Georgia Perimeter College and SUNY New York at Plattsburgh. I have judged off and on for 15 years predominately in the state of Texas. Most of my debating was performed in the 80's and 90's however I still stay up to date on a great many aspects of policies in our governent. Majored in Political Science/Teacher Education.

My feeling is simple. Convince me of your conviction and evidence and you win the debate. Although there are many judges who will go into great depth as to how they judge debate I feel that each and every round has its own merits. The speaker needs to convince me pure and simple. Your idea is the best and tell me why.....etc. Back that up with evidence, conviction, clarity, and feeling. Kritiks are fine as long as you are clear in your conviction of what it is you feel is wrong with your opponents arguments.

I do NOT mind counterplans but please be very thourough with them :) If you run it you need to defend it.

I will always respect each and every speaker and I expect you to do the same. IE> Being a jerk won't earn you speaker points with me! 

Please, feel free to ask me questions you may have and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future.
