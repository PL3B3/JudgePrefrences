  I tend to vote on the link story and need you to convince me that I prefer your world to your opponent's world. While I do flow, I do not appreciate the spread and you'll know if I've stopped flowing. All things being equal in the technical aspect of the round, I value good communication skills. I want to see good clash and you need to make it clear what your voting issues are at the end of the round.
