  I do not believe in favoring particular types of arguments over others. You debate how you want to debate. I will vote on Topicality, Framework, Critiques, Disads, Counterplans, Case arguments, etc. I will even vote on less conventional and creative arguments if the team is able to articulate and express them effectively. I want to see discussion that is clear, logical, and entertaining. It is also essential that there be good clash and actual arguments from the opposing team being addressed, ships in the night kind of debates bore me to death.

I believe evidence is vital to making a convincing case, but getting caught up on spreading as many cards as possible and shallowly fleshing them out isn’t enough for me. I would prefer you use evidence that you actually know and give in-depth analysis on why that evidence is relevant to your argument and why it matters in the round. Good analytics and painting the picture of the topics that are being discussed goes a long way with me. I want to see how these policies and ideas both teams are debating would play out in the real world, whether it be through physical action or philosophical rational.

Other than that, I just want participants to have good competitive fun. Having style and being sassy is always a bonus, just don’t yell at your opponents and be a jerk. This isn’t Sparta, bro.
