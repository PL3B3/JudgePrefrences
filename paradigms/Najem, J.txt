  Who I'm is?

If I hear music playing or someone mention the word 'camp', I will pull out my loaded 12 gauge and clean house.

Beer and buffalo wing offerings during prep time are encouraged, if not a prerequisite for a win.

My general paradigm revolves around two axioms:
(1) "F* the world, don't axe me for s*"
(2) "The positive upright, I'm that "I don't give a f***" type."

The only 'procedural issue' I know of is how to behave at my monthly arraignments for aggravated assault. 

The only 'stock issues' I care about involve the stock of beer in my fridge.

Spreading? Are you a police officer who just pulled me over for doing 90 in the 60 zone? I didn't think so.

I love America and freedom. The only thing I love more is my John Deere tractor.

If I leave the room, keep going it's ok.

Bring a quarter and be ready to call 'heads' or 'tails' at the end of the round.

In a nutshell, I'm SKELETOR!!!
