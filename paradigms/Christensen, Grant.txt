I'm a former debater at the University of Richmond and now a lawyer and law professor in Toledo, Ohio. I coach high school policy debate at Sylvania Northview High School and have had seven national qualifing teams in the last eight years. We've been to the TOC three times. 
I'm largely a TAB judge. I believe that a dropped argument becomes "true" in the world of the debate, but I need you to tell me what the consequences of this "truth" are and how they function in the wound. On T and procedurals I would prefer to see demonstrated abuse on the flow if the argument is still in the 2NR/2AR - literally point to where on the flow the argument that demonstrates the abuse it located.  I'm open to all arguements - with no expressed preference for or against the K v. a well developed DA. Debate is always more engaging when there is clash - through both argumentation and analysis of your evidence v. that of your opponent.  I flow CX - but if you get a key concession I need you to point that out somewhere on the flow and explain the implications of the concession as it relates to the round. 
Speed is perfectly acceptable. I’ll yell “slow” or “clear” If I can’t understand. 
Happy to answer any questions you have prior to the debate – just ask!
