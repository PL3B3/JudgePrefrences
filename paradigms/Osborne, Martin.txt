topicality et al - theory is fine but entire debates about it bore and frustrate me. cheap 
shots are not *necessarily* encouraged, but will be accepted if they go (a) conceded or poorly answered and (b) well explained - y'know, just like every other argument. topicality is probably about competing interpretations but i can be convinced otherwise. procedurals come first unless somebody tells me otherwise in the constructives.

k stuff [edited by website host to avoid profanity] - i don't mind k debate as long as it's done well. alternatives need text. if your k has a smaller impact than case and you do a poor job telling me why that's okay (de[ontological] reasons, "pre-fiat", etc.) you might lose to "case outweighs" or any arguments that work well in straight up impact comparison.

straight up - this is real debate. go straight up, please. have fun, be funny, use bad words, insult each other (tastefully) and if you're from a big school and you're a prick, i'll murder your speaks even if i
vote for 
you.
