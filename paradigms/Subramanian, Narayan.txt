Speed
-You can go as fast as you want but you need to be clear and understandable; I will yell "clear" a few times if need be
-Slow down at taglines and author names

Rebuttals
-Signposting is absolutely vital; Pause for a second or two so I can find the place you're at
-Number your responses and label turns
-Extend warrants and impacts (I'll give significantly less weight to an argument if the warrant/impact are not extended all the way through)

Theory
-If you're going to run theory, run it with structure (Interp, Violation, Standards, Voters)
-I won't be making internal links for you; they need to be in your shell
-If you're going for potential abuse, be extra explicit- I find these theory debates to be very muddled so don't let that happen
-I'm open to RVIs, discourse, and the like but you need to warrant these extra well for me to vote on them

Evidence
-Have full citations for authors
-Avoid ellipses if possible
-Make sure there are warrants
-I think debates with good evidence comparison are fun

Kritiks
-You must have an alt
-If you're going to read dense cards, go slower
-Make sure your cards are warranted

How I Evaluate the Round
-I will first look at the weighing mechanism the debaters provide me in the round i.e. Value/Criterion, Theory, or some alternate standard
-Absent a clear standard by which to evaluate the round, I will default to a net-benefits standard
-Weighing is very important to me unless you're running like a deontological or syllogistic case which is also fine but you need to still at a minimum compare your frameworks

Speaker Points
I will start at a 27 average and after that the following factors will raise or lower your speaks:
-Clarity/Fluency
-Argument Comparison (Comparing warrants, impacts, etc.)
-Quality of Arguments (I like politics arguments a lot)
-Overall Demeanor (Don't be a jerk, but don't be a pushover either)

At the end of the day, just have fun in round. Run arguments that you actually find interesting rather than just arguments that you think will win you the round- you'll see that you'll debate much better if you take that approach. Feel free to email me at email2narayan@gmail.com if you have any further questions about my paradigm. Good luck!
