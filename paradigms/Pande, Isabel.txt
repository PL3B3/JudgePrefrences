  I place a great emphasis on oratorical skills and who can most effectively carry their arguments across. I am a very traditional judge and do not like progressive styles because I feel that they take away from what LD is really about. I am fine with a moderate amount of clash but I will drop speaker points if CX becomes uncivil. Do not steal prep time when walking up to give speeches or try to pull anything over my head. As I previously mentioned but I will reiterate, I do not want fast speeches or any speaking that lacks clarity. Additionally, I would like to see organized and concise rebuttals that are voided of frivolous arguments that are not crucial voting issues. My final word of advice would be to tell me why I should give you the ballot.
