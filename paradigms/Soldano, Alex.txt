  I am a pretty standard progressive judge. I had four years debating competitively on the LD circuit in high school with some policy debate training, and have been coaching and judging on the Washington State/national circuit for the last three years. I love theory based debates and am willing to vote on them as long as the arguments are solid. Otherwise I am willing to adapt to any style of debate that you present to me and I will judge the round based on what you, as a competitor, tells me to do. I can handle pretty much any speed that you can go as long as you stay clear.
