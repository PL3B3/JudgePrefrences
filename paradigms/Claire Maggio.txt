  I'm in my second year of policy debate at the University of Rochester. this is my first time judging.
i'm been competing in open since october.

i usually run a combination of policy args and generic K's.

Theory -- generally i like it. if you can use it to creatively abuse the other team --- and are able to defend and justify it, i say go for it. just please warrant your claims, don't simply assert them.

T -- Overall, i think all affs need be at least somewhat topical. i don't enjoy radical or extreme arguments.

I love framework debates. my personal favorite debates to be in are K vs policy, stuff like realism or ontology is always fun.

i'm not especially familiar with a lot of k authors, i have a rough understanding of most of the common ones, but that's about it. you're probably better off running policy in front of me. that being said, i'm happy to vote for a well argued alternative.
