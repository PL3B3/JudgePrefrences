  I am a first year out currently attending Berkeley. Because I haven't been around the debate world much, I would recommend speaking a little slower than usual but if I need too I will just ask to read your arguments so you can use your time effectively. As an activist and someone who is politically inclined, I wouldn't mind to see some Ks or philosophy arguments. That being said, I ran a lot of consequentialist stuff back in the day, so I am most comfortable evaluating that. In terms of speaker points, don't be offensive to minorities or cultures, be respectful, and be rhetorically efficient.
