  I am currently a Novice/JV debater at the University of West Georgia. 

General: I like clearly explained arguments . I am a very flow oriented judge be clear and explain your args. I like clash and good cross examinations, but don't be rude or offensive in cross examinations ( I will doc speaks ). We can have a discussion about the decision, but don't argue. I hate this most of all. Remember there's only one way to win a debate. Get the judge to vote for you. Convince me and I'll vote for you. 

K: I like the k debate , but make sure you clearly explain your link. Have a clear alternative if the alt dosent solve why am I voting for you. 

Theory: I have a pretty high threshold for theory. But I will pull the trigger on a well constructed and winning theory argument. 

CP: I love a well developed CP. But make sure you have a clear net benefit. This is important. I won't vote on a CP with out a clear net benefit I also really ship (like) a DA that corresponds with a CP. 

T: I have a high threshold on T. Make sure you have a clear voting issue, and negative ground loss. But I will pull the trigger if your argument is clear and the voting issue is made. 

DA/Case: I like a DA with a good turn. This debate needs a lot of clash. I will vote on neg presumption. Explain why the DA out weighs Case. 

Speaks: I like speed but I love clarity. The combination is preferred but don't sacrifice clarity for speed. If it's not in my flow then I won't vote on it remember that. I will let you know if you are unclear.
