I am a policy oriented judge. My decision calculus is almost always an attempt to strictly
determine which policy will do the most good.

TOPICALITY is always a voting issue. 

COUNTERPLANS are encouraged. It is the affirmative's burden to
demonstrate their plan is better than the status quo or any competitive policy
option.

I like clear debates. Most debates are too fast and
too much emphasis is put on the technical and not on the persuasive.
Speed is over used in debate; analysis and critical thinking skills are an underutilized
tool.

CRITIQUES must be a reason to reject the affirmative. Negatives can't
simply say that they did something good; they must prove the
affirmative definitively prohibits that from happening.
