Experience: 4 years of high school policy debate at New Trier (IL) from 2009 to 2013.

Prep stops when the email is sent or the flash drive leaves your computer. If you have to go to the bathroom, go before taking prep or before another person's speech. Please don't take a 10 minute bathroom break before your speech.

Oceans topic - I have judged 2 debates at berkeley and ~10 debates from camp. Keep this in mind for T debates - I'm not sure what Affs people are reading. Please be extra generous in describing how your aff/CP works. And please explain your acronyms at least once. 

I was mostly a DA/CP debater in high school. Explain your arguments well. Be clear; I'd like to understand the cards too. I especially have a difficult time understanding many Ks, particularly why they are relevant to the Aff/topic. Be pleasant during the debate please.

My preferred 2NRs are:
DA/CP/SQ
Impact Turn
T
K
