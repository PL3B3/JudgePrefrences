  I typically judge public forum and enjoy traditional PF debates. I DISLIKE SPEED!! Remember this is the first time I’m hearing your arguments and if your mouth moves faster than my pen I will miss a lot of what you’re saying. 
Make my job easy to decide who wins the round, here are a few ways to do that for me:
Tagline everything: Even in rebuttal it should be crystal clear as to where on my flow I should be writing and where you are winning/defending
WEIGH YOUR ARGUMENTS!! I can’t vote if I don’t know what to vote for or what’s important in a round. Make me understand why your impacts should be weighed heavily, theirs are small, etc.
DON’T BE MEAN or condescending!! While it may not directly cost you the round, I certainly will be less prone to give high speaks and it will make it harder for me to give you my vote.
No evidence wars! Compare warrants and move on, if it’s a big deal read the indict and tell me to call for the card. You’ve both done too much work on the topic for the round to come down to an argument about a single card.
MOST IMPORTANTLY: Be Clear! If I don’t understand an argument, it doesn’t matter how well you extend it, I need to know what I’m voting for. Be clear and make me understand your arguments
This round is your opportunity for high speaks if you follow my criteria and keep this round clear and composed. As long as your team is controlled, calm, and professional you have nothing to worry about from me and can use this round to wow me with your knowledge and research on the topic!
