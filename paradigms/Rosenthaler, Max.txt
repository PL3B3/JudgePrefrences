  I competed in Lincoln-Douglas debate for three years mainly on local circuit
in Colorado during my Sophomore, Junior, and Senior year of high school, and was
captain during my final year. I also competed at the Berkeley Invitational three
years in a row.
That being said, I haven’t competed for about one and a half years. I enjoy
heavily philosophical debate, and though statistics and facts can serve to help your
point, I will always pick a philosophically sound argument over one that uses data as
a crutch. Ultimately, I view the purpose debaters in LD as being able to convey moral
theory in a way that is persuasive and accessible to viewers (such as was the
purpose of the original debates for which the style is named). Building off of that,
please no spreading. I don’t really think it aligns with my conception of what LD
should be, but I also have the selfish motive that I can’t really understand arguments
that are being spread (given that I haven’t competed for one and a half years.
Being aggressive is fine, as long as it appears to be result of passion over the
subject/debate, but if you are being unnecessarily aggressive, I won’t view it very
positively.
