  I'm a freshman at Princeton University. I debated sophomore and junior year in high school and judged a bit senior year, so I can keep up with some speed. That said, I wouldn't advise going your top speed because that's likely a higher speed than what I can flow. 

I tend to heavily prefer substance and traditional value/VC debates. I'll vote on theory too, if you explain it clearly. Besides that I haven't kept up much with the LD scene, so if you're going to run Ks anything weird make sure to explain it assuming I have no clue how the argument functions.
