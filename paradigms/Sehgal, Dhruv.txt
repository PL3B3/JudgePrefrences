  2nd year debater at Binghamton University.

I have read both policy and critical arguments on both sides. this year, I have been doing mostly critically oriented work, so I am much more comfortable with those debates/arguments.

first time judging this high school topic so I am unfamiliar with most of the topic literature, so don't assume I know what a certain acronym or phrase means.

paradigm:

i do not really have a strong default setting for judging. I am pretty open to any styles of arguments you want to present in front of me. the burden is on you to tell me what my role as a judge should be, what my ballot means/signifies, and what impacts should be prioritized in a debate.

thanks, and if you have any other questions feel free to ask me
