  Hey, I'm Alex. Currently a freshman at Bowdoin College, I debated all four years of high school, and went to the TOC in 2010.

I'm not debating in college, nor am I coaching. I am pretty much out of the loop regarding topic lit, stock positions, etc right now, so please don't assume I'll get everything right away. Obviously, this won't be so much of a problem later on in the tournament.

I will flow as quickly as I can, but as I said before, I'm out of practice. I'm okay with yelling speed a few times and if I still don't get something important I'll look at the card after the round.

What I like to see in-round:
Weighing. Do it early, do it often. Explain the implications and preempts within your framework. Overviews at the beginning of speeches.
I have a pretty high threshold for theory, please don't run it as a time suck as it will take away from speaker points. I default to competing interpretations. 

Absolutely feel free to ask me any questions you have before the round. Be nice to each other, and have fun!
