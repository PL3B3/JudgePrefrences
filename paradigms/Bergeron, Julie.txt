  I am a parent judge for Jesuit High School in New Orleans, Louisiana. I have seen very few debate rounds and none on the Jan/Feb 2011 topic. I know the basics of LD debate, values, criteria, etc. but do not have an in depth knowledge of debate jargon. Be sure you speak slowly and clearly; if you speak too quickly, you will not pick up my ballot. I will take some notes during the round but am more concerned with you persuading me that your side of the resolution is correct. If you are a fast, technical debater, strike me. I am open to all types of arguments, but they must make sense and be presented coherently.
