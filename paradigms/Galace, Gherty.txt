  I am a novice judge this year (2017-2018), and I am still learning the ropes of how to judge the various branches of debate. I am an English teacher with experience in teaching argument in AP English Language and Composition. One of the things I definitely look out for while hearing debates is the use of facts and reasons and how well you use them for your argument. While talking fast might benefit some competitors, it's still important to enunciate words so that your speech is clear.
