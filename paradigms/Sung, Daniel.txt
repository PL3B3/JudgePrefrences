1. Debaters should treat each other with respect.
2. Usually on theory such as condo and dispo, I err neg.
3. Usually on T, I err aff. Neg must clearly prove that its loss of ground is worse than the exclusion of the plan from the debate.
4. I will evaluate Kritiks as long as you know what you're talking about and can clearly debate the issue at hand. Please remember to try to explain terms that you think I may not know or understand.
5. I like DA turns case arguments and want impact calculus to explain why the DA is how you frame it to be.
