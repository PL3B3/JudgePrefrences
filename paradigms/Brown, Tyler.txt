  I competed for 4 years in LD at the local, state and national level. I graduated on ’09 and was the co-captain of my debate team the final 2 years. I have been trained as a traditional Lincoln Douglas debater relying on heavy value/criterion analysis and linkage throughout case. But with my time on the national circuit I have become accustomed to varying styles including flex negs, off cases and narratives. I will listen to anything but you must always link back to the V/C debate. This is LD, not policy.
As far as style goes I will listen to any speed but if I cannot understand you I will not flow you. Also, I am not going to allow someone to be spewed out of a round (don’t throw out 20 impacts on C2B and expect me to vote off of all of them). If you want to use speed to get through evidence that’s fine, but slow down for tags and for important analysis. 
Decision calculus. It is easy to win my ballot. I need to see V/C analysis and how negating/affirming will impact. Give me clear voters at the end of a round, and do your best to cover the flow. At the end of the day the person who covers flow and shows my why their value is paramount due to impacts will win the round. 
Have fun and be respectful. If you are a jerk it will reflect on your ballot.
