  I am a parent judge for Brighton High School. I do not have very much experience and prefer traditional styles of debate.
speed: I do not like progressive debate and if I can not understand you I will not consider the argument.
theory: I do not know much about theory so if you use it make sure to explain it very well.
topicality: I like it when people stay on topic and do not like excessive off topic arguments.
kritiks: I do not like kritiks and would prefer if you do not use them. If you do use them make sure that you clearly explain the link to the resolution or why you are making that argument.
