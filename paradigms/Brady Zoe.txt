  
Background: I debated for 4 years at Durant High School in Durant, OK in LD. I went to state two consecutive years. I live for eloquent speakers. If you can present your points in a manner that suggests you have some kind of superior intelligence you immediately have the upper hand. My personal approach was dependent heavily on CX and speaking skills rather than framework.

Paradigm for LD:
I love philosophy but also love EVIDENCE. It is crucial to back up any philosophy you have if the resolution implies that it should/can be applied to the real world. Do NOT spread, if I can't understand you, I can't flow or adequately judge the round. Provide clash for God's sake. If you have no clash you have no debate and I have to judge in favor of the person that had the best framework. (If no clash is provided the Aff normally ALWAYS wins)


General Behavior: If you sound unsure of yourself, I automatically default to thinking you're BS'ing. Do not use team cases with me, I CAN TELL. Do not yell or act snobby to your opponent, that will result in me removing speaker points. I'm stingy about them (speaks) already so I would like you to EARN them.
