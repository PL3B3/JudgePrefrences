  I currently judge Lincoln-Douglas Debate on the high school circuit. I am the assistant debate coach for Madison County High School in Virginia. I competed in LD during high school and policy at Liberty University 2002-2003. Until, I transferred to the University of Virginia. I assisted in lecturing LD for Liberty University's Debate Institute in the summer of 2002.

Lincoln-Douglas Debate Paradigms:

I am a TRADITIONALIST. Policy and LD debate are separate events for a reason. It would be to your advantage to not use speed, policy arguments, and policy catch-phrases in a round that I am judging. Your pace should be slightly faster than conversation speed. Obviously, I understand that you need to speak faster during your rebuttals and expect you to do so. But, do not speak fast during your constructives. There is no need to spread arguments in LD, the debate focuses around principles and values not evidence. Philosophy is a key area of LD debate, and I enjoy hearing various concepts and ideas. Make sure you are running philosophical arguments correctly and fully understand the arguments you are using.

Voting Issues:

It is to your advantage to list voting issues in the final rebuttal. As well as, explain how you won these arguments. If not, I will vote based upon core value and value criterion clash first. If this clash is missing then I will proceed to key arguments and contentions. If you do not want me to vote this way, you better tell me in the last speech.

I keep a riguorous flow throughout the debate. I expect you to go line by line and to do roadmapping.
