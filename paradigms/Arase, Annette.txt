 Judging Preferences: What I pay attention to and listen for:
 Clear and coherent articulation
Persuasiveness of argument
Breathing
Eye contact
Minimal theory - minimal philosophy
Dropped arguments
Concrete transitions
Well-reasoned, well-researched evidence
Logical, rational analytics
Debaters who are succinct and use well cut evidence
Spreading is my least favorite technique in debate.
