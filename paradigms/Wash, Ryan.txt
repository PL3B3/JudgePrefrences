I believe that debaters make debate what it is. Often times as a debater who engaged in alternative models and styles of debate, I always wanted to have some say over how debate is interpreted by my critics, and I intend to hold that standard for myself. That does not mean that I am going to forget who I am as a person, or a critic, but it also does not mean that I will neglect who you have asked me to be, what you have asked me to do, how you have asked me to do it, and why you have asked me to do it. That being said, I expect for you to be you. I expect that you come to debate having thought about that. I appreciate the process in which debaters approach to their arguments. I am not saying that you need to have those arguments in a specific form or style, but I am saying you should be able to freely discuss that process on all level. I don’t feel the need to break down each argument, but I will say that you need to explain the story of the argument and its implication on the discussion at hand. Be creative, be funny or serious (whatever you do), be smart, and be confident. Good luck and may the odds ever be in your favor!
