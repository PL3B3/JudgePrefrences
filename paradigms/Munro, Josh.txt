  I expect clash. I especially prefer to see on case analysis and clash be a part of any debate. I will vote on whatever is brought up in round so you are in control of the ballot as long as you are debating.

I will listen to K and any theory but I expect it, as well as DA's, to be case specific and not just generic, canned arguments that the debater cannot explain in their own words. 
Speed is fine as long as you are still able to be understood and communication occurs. If I stop writing then you need to slow down. 

Please sign post and provide impact/analysis to your arguments.

I am good with anything you want to run. I do not think I as a judge should be completely changing the style you debate but I do expect to see actual debate.
