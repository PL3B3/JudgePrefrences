  I''ve been the debate coach at Bishop O'Dowd High School for the last five years. The team's speciality is parli but this year we've branched out into LD and PuFo with some success.

As for a policy judging paradigm, I go with stock issue, but you have liberty to be creative if I find your argument convincing enough.

I've judged lots of rounds in LD, parli, policy, pufo, over the last five years, so I'm not going to be surprised by much. If you feel a K is warranted, all the power to you. If it's good and pertinent, I might vote on it.
