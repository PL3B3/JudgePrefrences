  tl:dr: Impact calc the sooner the better. I want to know what the aff world and the neg world looks like after I sign the ballot. I let the debaters set the rules for what I should weigh first and what should/n't be allowed in round. I don't believe in judge intervention except for issues of in round abuse or misrepresenting the other teams arguments. I will call for cards frequently. I'm a fan of argumentation and analysis. The better these are the better your speaker points.

K's: They are fine as long as both partners understand it and one partner doesn't carry the other and framework is well explained. If the other team isn't getting it, it your job to make them understand so we can have a good debate.

Speed: Slow the heck down on the tags. Cut your cards down so you can read at an intelligible rate.

Experience: 4 years policy debate in HS. 3 years policy and value debate (CEDA/NEDA/NDT) in college. 2 years coaching policy debate.
