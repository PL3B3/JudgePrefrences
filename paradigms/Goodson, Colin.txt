  Name: Colin Goodson

School: Apple Valley High School

Experience: I have coached Lincoln-Douglas Debate since August 2001

Please consider me a traditional standards judge. The best rounds I have judged are when debaters set up a standard for how I should evaluate the debate and then impact and weigh arguments to through that standard. I like to hear "big picture" crystallization at the end of the last rebuttals on both sides. As a traditional judge I am very un-inclined to vote on theory arguments, a priori, kritiks or plans unless they are heavily warranted. I think I have voted on those types of arguments twice in 11 years of coaching (to put how un-inclined I am to vote on those arguments into perspective).

SPEED: Please speak at a conversational speed.
