  I am a junior at Harvard College who did CX in high school. Be forewarned: I have judged no rounds on this year's topic. That being said, my judging philosophy is pretty tabula rasa. I flow and I expect all the argumentation in the round to be impacted back to the flow. At the end of the round, I decide the winner based on what is on the flow and how it is impacted. Don't be rude and have a good time.
