  Background
I attended Loyola Blakefield in Maryland, debated for four years, attended VBI, and competed at the TOC my senior year (2011). I now attend the University of Maryland where I’m majoring in philosophy. 

General
Clear spreading is ideal. I try to intervene as little as possible. The round is yours so I am open to any argument and will try to evaluate it as objectively as possible. My default positions will change if you're winning those arguments in round.

Speed
Speed is encouraged; I personally liked to debate as fast as I could. A few caveats though:
- Try not to read at top speed if you're hitting a novice. You can still go fast, just make it bearable. 
- I won’t vote off of things not on my flow. If I can’t flow you I will shout “clear” as many times as necessary for me to flow you. Be-aware though that if I'm calling clear, I am missing arguments that I won't vote on, no matter how clearly they are articulated in the next speech.
- Give me a sec when switching offs so i can find it on my computer

Theory
I really enjoy good theory debates. Bad theory debates are at the other end of the spectrum. I also really like non-conventional theory shells. Nuance, specificity, and clarity are key for any shell. When reading theory, make sure to slow down for your interp so I know exactly what the shell is. An RVI is fine if you justify it well. 

Other Args
The round is yours so whatever position you run, I'll try my best to evaluate it as objectively as possible. Creative arguments are always encouraged. I like policy style arguments that are appropriately adopted to LD and am fine with args like skep, permis, and aprioris. Bad/blippy permissibility debates annoy me, but I still often vote off of them, I just prefer for these arguments to be more developed. For crazy Ks read at a slower pace and explain them. I think critical args are often better than Ks, but Ks are still fine. Be careful when running pre-fait Ks; those debates can often end up too personal and weird. K's usually should, but often do not, have a ballot framework and normative framework (if you don't, explain why they aren't necessary for you to win). Running theory on post-fiat K alts is usually a good idea.

CX/Flex
There needs to be two, three-minute CXs, but asking questions during prep is totally fine. The competitor should make what s/he reads available during his/her opponent's speeches, CX, and flex. I assume CX is binding.

Extensions
I vote off what I have on the flow in the last rebuttals. This means that extensions should cover the argument that you want me to vote off of. I have a lower threshold for aff extensions, but they still need to cover the argument, just not as in-depth. Pre-written extensions can be good although you must explain the embedded clash between your extensions and your opponents arguments; also don't blaze through pre-written extensions at top speed. 

Things I like that may result in higher speaks: 
- being extremely clear 
- running more nuanced, creative theory shells/rvis/interps/counter interps/voters
- reading the dates of ALL* your evidence when you first read the card (*ie don't read the dates of just your recent evidence while neglecting to read the dates of old evidence)
- reading author qualifications in the tags when it's relevant
- unique plans or DAs with great evidence
- deeply understanding the philosophy of your framework 
- being funny and aggressive
- slowing down a lot for tags, names, and short analytics 
- saying "unquote" at the end of cards if it's not clear where it ends

Things I don’t like that may result in lower speaks: 
- blips with big implications 
- intentionally making your case confusing in the constructive and cx and making it abundantly clear once you get to the rebuttals (I will only lower speaks if I am sure that this is happening)
- reading more than one page of evidence off of your computer without a flash drive or viewing computer 


I will disclose my decision and give comments after the round. If you disagree with my decision I encourage you to ask me questions about why I voted the way I did. Keep it polite, but don’t be afraid to challenge why I made a certain decision. You can learn more and so can I when you ask questions and politely discuss/argue my decision. If you have any questions before or after the round don’t be afraid to ask or email me. My email is connorvbi at gmail.
