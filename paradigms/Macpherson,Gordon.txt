  This is my first year as a judge. I vote with the stronger quality of argument. I am looking for depth of arguments and warrants behind your claim. I attempt to remove my individual biases from the round and make debaters tell me where and why to vote. From a strategic perspective, you can do what you need to do to win. You will be able to tell from my non-verbal indicators if I am getting your argument. Use your rebuttal to tell me why you win and where your arguments overwhelm the other team. Tell me why your impact outweighs their impacts on timeline, magnitude or probability. I would probably go with concrete impacts over abstract ones. I love humor and wittiness in debate rounds and I expect respect for your opponents to be displayed. Have tons of fun!
