  I coach for Cooper City High School but have the least experience with LD debate so don't let the title "coach" fool you into thinking I'm a pro. Please do not spread, I don't understand you through the gasping. Treat me as a lay judge with maybe a bit more intricacy to your case. I know the basics about theory, kritiks, disads, counterplans; basically, if you are going to use anything other the V/VC in the case you just need to explain a simple definition and tell me how you've achieved it in your case.
