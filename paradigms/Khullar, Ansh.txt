All truths in rounds are settled contingently
Although it is impossible to do so entirely, I will attempt to set aside personal biases* about arguments when judging
I'd rather not read evidence to reconstruct a ballot that doesn't reflect the debating on the flow
An argument consists of a claim and warrant - unwarranted claims that become warranted, blippy 1nc shells/aff advantages that become robustly evidenced later on, and incoherent explanations that later become coherent are not "concessions" by your opponents, they are new arguments that merit new answers when they become real arguments
If I can't explain what I'm voting for, I won't vote for it

How to get better speaks in front of me
Speak clearly - you would probably be better off going 80% speed (or slower tbh, speed = ideas communicated per minute, not words)
Don't assume I know all of your acronyms/buzzwords
Quality is better than quantity - both in terms of evidence and explanation

*Things my biases will effect:
I won't kick a counterplan for you after the 2NR unless explicitly told otherwise 
I will not, under any circumstances, evaluate something that happened outside of the debate round when making my decision
If you interrupt your opponent's speech, I will tank your speaks the first time, and if you do it again you will lose
Zero tolerance for any attacks on your opponent's character, appearance, or anything else - I don't care who you are or what your argument is

Ethics challenge ends the debate - default to tournament rules for clipping, etc
