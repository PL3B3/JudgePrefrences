  I have been involved in debate for 13 years and am currently an assistant coach at Liberty University.
I try to be as unbiased as possible and am open to any kind of argumentation as long as it is well reasoned and presented. While I do my best to stick to what I have on my flow when making a decision, I reserve the right to ignore arguments that do not make any sense (ie "we should win because the sky is blue").
Some thoughts on a few arguments:
Topicality: T is a voting issue that I evaluate typically based on competing interpretations, and is NOT a reverse voting issue. Please impact this argument.
Conditionality: I will vote on this argument, but I warn that I ere neg on this issue unless there is clear in round abuse.
Kritiks: I will vote on K's as long as there is a clear link and alternative. Please explain these arguments well. If it is clear that you have no idea what you're talking about, that makes this argument very much less persuasive to me.

I try not to interfere with the round in anyway, be that facial expressions or verbal cues (such as calling clear), and am prompt with the timer (cx starts immediately after the constructive speech is over unless you ask for prep).

When in doubt, make with the good debating, not the bad debating. If you have questions, please ask, the more specific the better.

Love,
Milton
