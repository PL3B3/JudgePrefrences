  I am a “Lay Judge” and although I debated LD in High School and part of College, it has changed a lot. I am sure all of you are better than I ever was.
I am interested in logical arguments and counters that are extended, not flowery rhetoric.
Speed: A little faster than conversational is fine as long as it is clear. If I don’t understand your words, I cannot follow or flow it.
Speak Points: Good clarity, fluency, roadmaps, etc.
Theory: I don’t understand theory so it probably won’t hold much weight with me.
I understand my limitations and hope you will understand them as well.
Good Luck!
