  Two years of policy experience in highschool, two years on the college circuit. 

I will vote on anything that is well articulated and wins the flow. I prefer argumentation over card extension.

Comfortable with critical theory. 

Anything I donâ€™t like will be reflected in speaker points, not the decision, I can give a low point win. Be nice to your partner. 

TL;DR: Do what you want, pal.

If I somehow judge LD:
I did LD for two years, I like traditional, old-school LD where values and criterions matter and such,
but basically look to the TL;DR of my policy paradigm.
