I am a lay judge and have been judging tournaments since 2013. I keep all personal biases out of my judging and enjoy a well-constructed argument. I will not automatically judge a round one way or another based solely on what framework, value criterion or theory is used - when I’m flowing I am particularly looking for you to define terms really well; make a clear argument based on sound logic; and keep the organization of your arguments tight and controlled so I can see a clear, consistent line of argument all the way throughout in each part of the round. Pet peeves: unnecessary rudeness toward opponent – you can absolutely be firm and assertive in your argument but keep it civil and respectful towards the dignity of your opponent
