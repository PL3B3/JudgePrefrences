  Background - 4 years of policy debate at Iowa City West High School, debated for one year at the University of Iowa in college, have judged on high school topics for the past three years.
Judging Philosophy – a set of preferences, preconceived notions that are open to questioning within the debate round. 
Notions -- tabula rasa.
Debate – a game of competing presentations wherein an imperfect judge decides the winner based on logical, credibility, and emotional appeals
Speed – the number of arguments that you make in a speech that the judge believes the other team must answer in the next speech
Argument – a complete claim that is impacted out and a reason which is often supported by evidence
Evidence – cards that supplement not substitute for arguments, fewer cards that are longer and more qualified and more warrant-filled beat more cards of lesser quality.
Framework - while I went for framework arguments quite frequently against affirmatives that did not defend a "traditional" policy affirmative, I try to stay as objective as possible in evaluating different modes of debate and arguments about why debate matters.
