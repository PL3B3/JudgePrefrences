  I debated for 4 years in high school for Cypress Bay down in Weston, FL and graduated in 2014. I did 1 year of college debate at Vanderbilt University but stopped after my freshman year because I wanted to explore other activities and my debating style didn't really match up with a lot of other people on the team. 

In high school, my favorite argument to read was kritiks. At the same time, I did enjoy reading a classic ptx/cp strat so you can honestly read whatever you want in front of me. That being said, the only things that I think you need to know about me and the way I judge are these few points:
1) A dropped argument isn't necessarily a round winner. Whether or not your opponent drops the argument, you need to make sure you explain the warrants of said argument and why that argument is going to outweigh anything else that may have been read in the round.
2) Make sure you extend the warrants to your arguments. Any claim you make is incomplete without it.
3) Tell me how to vote at the end of the round. I want to be able to make my decision using the words you said in your 2AR and 2NR.
4) Offensive language and general rudeness will most definitely be punished with a loss of speaker points or worse (depending on the severity of it). At the end of the day, debate should be a fun and safe space for everyone involved, so please keep it that way.

If you have any specific questions, don't be afraid to ask me anything before the round.
