  Experience: I've had very brief LD debate experience in highschool. 

Paradigms: I consider myself generally free of hard-lined paradigms. My only major requests is to speak clearly and not too quickly so that I can maximally absorb the arguments being presented. My approach is to be as non-interventionist as possible. Try to keep value judgments to a minimum unless they are specifically relevant to the argument at hand.
