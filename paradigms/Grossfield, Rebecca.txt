  Hi – my name is Rebecca – I graduated Monticello High School in 2003 and debated policy for four years in high school. I am open to all well-made arguments – topicality, counterplans, kritiks, spreading, whatever, is all fine by me if argued well. Please do not run arguments you do not fully understand—I value clarity in thought which I think makes for a better learning experience all around.

More than anything, I appreciate careful analysis, line-by-line and clash from both sides (ie- How should I evaluate your kritik vs. specifics of affirmative case in this particular round and why?).

Lastly, be polite!

Thanks and good luck!
