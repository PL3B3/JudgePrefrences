4 year public forum debater at Meade (WA), now a member of the Georgetown Philodemic Debate Society.

I view the debate as if I am the President and you are in my cabinet. I will only respond to questions if addressed correctly as Madame President.

In all seriousness, I don't think it's within my jurisdiction to tell you how you should debate and I don't necessarily think that you should change the way you debate just because I'm in the back of the room. As a debater myself, I'm most likely to go for a counterplan/ disad or T. That being said, if you choose to go for the K, I'm probably not going to understand your K jargon so make sure you explain the link and alternative in a way that I can understand. I'm not unwilling to vote for an argument I'm unfamiliar with as long as it is well explained.

I have mixed feelings about affs with no plan as a debater, but I'm interested in hearing what you have to say, especially if it somehow relates to the topic. You can perform however you'd like/ choose not to read evidence/ etc, but I think you have to have a strong defense for why that's good in debate. If you're neg against such a team, T is both relevant and important. That being said, I'm willing to vote for teams that don't defend a plan.

You do you- just remember that debate is supposed to be both fun and educational, so don't be mean to either your opponents or your partner. Have fun and feel free to ask questions if you have them!
