  Hello, I am a parent judge but I debated high school policy in Texas for 4 years in the late 80s and in college in the 90s. I am an economist so if you run flimsy econ cases I'll know how weak they are. 

Flashing is fine, but do it quickly. I prefer to be on the email chain edward.sayre@gmail.com 

Open CX is fine.

I generally don’t care where you speak from, how you are dressed, or how informally you speak as long as it’s a good debate.

Be nice, I don’t like debaters who disrespect others. 

I mainly operate as a tabula rasa judge. I’m open to most arguments, but want a clear explanation as to why I should vote on it. I’m sure there are exceptions to this if you try to push ethical boundaries with an argument.

I like a clear debate with lots of clash and clear summaries that explain how you think I should weigh things and how I should vote. Don’t leave it up to me to weigh everything.

I don’t like to have to ask to see cards because I think debaters need to put the arguments on the flow and give me enough info to make a decision. I will ask to see something if it’s not clear in the end, and it might be a voting issue, though. I prefer if you keep me from having to intervene on your behalf. 

I am okay with speed, but don't go too fast I might not be able to keep up. I will yell clear if I can't hear you, and I will stop flowing if I still can't keep up.

LARP is probably the best form of debate but that doesn't mean I won't vote on other args. 

I prefer debating the topic, but if you can defend non-topical affs and beat T/FW then it's your choice.

On Ks, I prefer post-fiat Ks and usually won't buy a pre-fiat arg but if you think you can convince me go for it.
