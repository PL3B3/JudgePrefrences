  I debated in Policy and Public Forum in high school (4 years).

I debated in IPDA debate at Boise State. (2 years)

I coach speech and debate (all types) at an Idaho high school (1st year).

I tend to like traditional policy debate more than extreme kritical. 

K’s: That being said, I won’t dismiss a K just because it is read. However, you must explain and do work on it. I don’t spend my time reading philosophy and K authors, so I expect you to take adequate time to explain it. I do not love ‘one off: K.’

T: I love a good topicality debate. If it is a legitimate argument (i.e. they are not topical…), run T.

CPs: Same as any other position, I will evaluate it if you do the work. I don’t love topical counterplans.

DAs: I like under views on off case arguments. I really like case-specific disadvantages.

Framework & Theory: I don’t usually vote on either of these issues unless they are ran amazingly. I like legitimate positions and give clear reasons for running it. I like the debate to stay off the philosophical level and for it to stay on the real world level.

Tolerance for speed is about a 6 out of 10. I can understand most, but need SLOW tag and author. 

Impact out your arguments… I love a good impact calc.
