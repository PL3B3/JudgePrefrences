Top Level Stuff:
-Dropped argument is a true argument as long as the warrant is extended
-Impact calc plays a large role in my decision
-I think affs should be about the topic
-disclosure is cool



More specific stuff-


Kritiks:
I'm not as well read on your K literature as you probably are so be cautious on the amount of buzz words you're using. That being said a portion of the block should be dedicated to explaining to me what the kritik is and how it functions with the aff. When judging debates where this is the 2nr, the first thing I look at mostly is the alt debate. I have a hard time voting neg when not a lot of work is done in this area. I need to see clear arguments as to what the world of the alt looks like and why the alt solves better. You need to be winning that the alt has a competitive advantage over the aff. 


Topicality:
Competing interps over reasonability. Limits are universally good. In terms of K affs, I tend to think topicality is more persuasive than a framework arg.

Counterplans:
should be competitive with the aff
As far as disads and theory go-I don't have any issues here. 

If you have specific questions please ask before the round.
