  I am a sophomore from Harvard-Westlake, who has debate LD for 3 years. 

Here’s how you get high speaks:
Good impact calc and line-by-lineWarranted extensionsGood Strat/ CollapsingBring me kit kat —> HIGH speaks fam
Speed:
I’m fine with speed, but PLEASE do not try to spread if you’re going to be super unclear. Slow down for tags. 

Theory/T:
It’s cool if there's real abuse. Tell me how I should evaluate the arguments, and I’ll be sure to weigh it exactly how you tell me if you give me good warrants.

 Defaults:
Competing interpsNo RVI’s In round > potential abuse


K’s:
Love them, but make sure there's a real link. On perms: please explain what the perm does and how it solves better. 

Misc:
CX is binding
Flashing isn’t prep time, but compiling the doc is. Also, please include me in the email chain email: jim1@hwemail.com
 Make funny puns and I’ll probs give you > 28 speaks
