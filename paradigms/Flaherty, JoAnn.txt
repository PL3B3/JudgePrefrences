  I am primarily a traditional judge. I think speed is okay as long as it's coherent and articulated, but please don't spread. Progressive arguments are accepted but not preferred. I will vote primarily on your value, value criterion and impacts. Off-time road maps are okay. Drops of whole contentions are important, and you should tell me why they're important, but drops of single facts or details are not as important. As for timing, I will time the round, and it is okay for you to time yourselves as well.
