  I debated for four years at Royal Palm Beach High School, and currently attend the University of Central Florida. 

I judge rounds based off of what the competitors impress to me in the room, not with my own opinions of the topic. It is important that debaters establish some sort of standard that the round will be impacted/weighed to (such as a value/criterion). My decision is usually based off of who wins key arguments, made it clear to me that they were important arguments, and persuaded me that their position was the correct one overall while sticking to their standard.

Voting points, road mapping, and impacting your points are all fairly important. Tell me what you think are the most important parts of the round - give me reasons. Clarity is important. If you know why you should win, then tell me that.

I prefer conversational speed; if you are going too fast for me to understand, I'm not going to slow you down, but I'm not going to flow either. I am not used to the rapid speed that is often used in LD debate.
