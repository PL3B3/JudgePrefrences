General
I generally prefer tech over truth, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to vote on ASPEC if its droppedI try to stick to my flow as much as possible, and will only look at cards if there is equal contestation on certain argumentsClarity is more important than speedDon't let anything I say in the rest of my philosophy deter you from reading certain arguments, debating what you are best at is important and will probably maximize your speaker points.Don't be rude
Affirmative
I prefer that affirmatives have a plan text topical to the resolution, but I'm willing to hear anything. If you are reading a K aff with no plan text I prefer it be centered around the issues of the resolution.I like it when 2A's have embedded clash in their line-by-line. That will get you really good speaks.
Disadvantages
As much as I love the politics DA, I prefer DA's that are specific to each aff and talk about the nuances of the aff (especially since every generic DA can probably be non-uniqued because of past engagement with ChinaI think that there can be 0% risk of a DAI don't necessarily think that uniqueness controls the direction of the link.Politics Theory: I don't think aff arguments on this are persuasive and I think that your time is much better spent on answering the substance of the DAKeep overviews short and sweet
Counterplans
Counterplans should be functionally competitive with the affirmativeI like to see Ks as net-benefits to the CPDelay CPs are bad and are probably abusive
Kritiks
I prefer a middle of the ground framework; I think its best for debateLinks should be specific to the plan and nuanced - I don't like the generic security KI love it when teams re-cut affirmative evidence and use it as links for the KK-tricks are a must in the blockI am not that knowledgeable in K literature, so you will need to clearly explain to me what your link, impact, and alternative are.
Topicality
I really like topicality debates.I think that one of the most important parts of topicality is the interpretation. The negative really needs to explain their interpretation and explain why the affirmative doesn't meet. I think that T cards specific to the affirmative really help.I don't really like the T-QPQ/No QPQ debates. I generally think that affirmatives shouldn't be QPQ, but I would rather hear debates with more specific interpretations to the plan textTopicality should be debated kind of like a DA
Theory
Conditionality bad is probably one of the few theory arguments that I will vote on, other theory arguments I think i should just reject instead of voting the team down
