If you go for the K/project, it will be an uphill battle. Please don’t pref me.

On issues of T and theory, I will evaluate the flow; I have no preconceived notions about what is fair in debate. That means Consult, Recommend, and Neg-biased T violations are all fair game as long as the Neg wins the theory debate.

Experience on this year’s topic: None, though, a lack of topic knowledge should not deter you from going for T.

Speed: four years at GBN means I can probably flow you

Paperless: Prep ends when the flash drive physically leaves your computer

I will reward teams that make strategic decisions and concessions in the debate.
