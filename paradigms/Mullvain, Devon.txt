  I was a four year debate student, and participated on the national circuit. I do not like debaters running the K or CP if you do they better be strong and convincing otherwise it will be severely counted against you. I look at impact analysis as a critical voting factor, and evidence from credible sources are necessary; failure to read evidence sources will drop the argument.
