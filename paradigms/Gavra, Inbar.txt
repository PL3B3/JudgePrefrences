  Hi! I debated for four years at Los Altos High School. I haven’t heard spreading in over a year, so plz don’t pref me if you want me to understand you– or just speak clearly and keep it at a relatively understandable rate, your call.
If you like tricks, I’m not the judge for you. I don’t remember anything other than theory and the classic philosophical debate. I didn't understand Ks when I debated and I don't understand them now.
Speaks average at 28, just don’t be offensive or unclear. If you make 5 references in the following categories– Baby Got Back, Milkshake, or the show Friends– or if you break into dance mid speech I’ll give you 30 speaks.
There are probably better judges out there. Keep looking.
