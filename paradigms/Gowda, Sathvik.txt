  History: 
I debated Public Forum at Leland High School for four years and am now a freshman in college. I've been to various national circuit tournaments and competed at TOC in PF last year. 

Paradigm:
I have not competed in or judged fast policy/ld, so if you need to spread, run K's, or whatever, then you should strike me.
That being said: 
I evaluate the round on the conventional flow, meaning I'm usually only evaluating a substance debate. Weighing arguments well in your late speeches is what will earn you my ballot.
I won't vote for you if your argument is blatantly racist, sexist, homophoic, e.t.c.
I have a very general understanding of theory, and will vote on it ONLY in the circumstance that the violation is really severe. Since I'm from PF, that line is pretty high for me and generally speaking i won't find an argument abusive.
If you decide to run theory, please make sure your shell is well organized and easy to flow, because if I don't understand it, I can't vote on it. I don't evaluate RVI
If you have any specific questions for me feel free to ask me before the round. I really believe that the judges job is to work with the debaters, so if there is any clarification you need please ask.
