  My judging preferences are: 1. Do not spread too quickly; if you notice that I am not flowing, be observant and slow down. 2. I will not vote for a round solely on a criterion debate; your goal is to persuade me to vote for your side, a criterion debate is only a minuscule portion of the overall LD debate. 3. If you would like me to extend your arguments, I prefer that you signpost them. Rather than telling me why I should extend your argument, I would appreciate a brief summary explaining specifically why you justify this extension.
