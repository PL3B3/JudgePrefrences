  I graduated from Scarsdale High School in 2016 and qualified to the TOC my senior year. I now attend Cornell University.

As a debater I ran a lot of really sketchy tricks/theory/etc. so that's probably what I'll be most comfortable evaluating as a judge, but I also consider myself fairly well versed in framework. As a debater I hated K's and LARP, but since I've become really distanced from the activity I no longer hold these preferences and will probably be able to evaluate those debates fine. Do whatever you want. Slow down. Be clear. I haven't read any topic lit, so explain your arguments well to me. Please don't be a sexist/ableist/homophobic/racist asswipe.
