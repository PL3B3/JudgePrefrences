  I debated for Iowa City High for three years (alternative energy, social service and military topics). I’m studying Philosophy and Economics right now at Grinnell College--if that’s at all helpful.
Critiques--I like critiques, but less so now than when I was debating. I won’t vote for a critique if it’s not explained (unless the aff drops it), specificity and case interaction are important. I view framework as vital if either team brings it up but just reading framework interpretations won’t get very far.
Other things. Counterplans are sweet. Case-specific DA’s are nice, but generic ones with good evidence work too. I think case debates are really important and something that doesn’t happen enough. I’m not a huge fan of topicality or theory. I never wanted to take these arguments in highschool, but I understand they’re important. So if your strategy banks on winning of these things be forewarned.
