I weigh most on impacts in the round and rank that of highest priority when deciding. I will take into account topicality arguments, theory and framework arguments, and will consider any Kritiks. I believe education is a large priority of the debate round, and will strongly consider that as a significant impact in the round. As far as preferences, I prefer slightly-slower-than-spreading speeds if possible.
