  Hi, 

I am Tien Pham and I am an experienced lay judge. I have judged at Stanford (prelims and out rounds) for the last three years. I am an computer arts teacher, food critic, and comic book artist.

I know little about debate theory, so make sure you avoid jargon. I don't mind you running theory, but you have to explain to me what it is that you are actually doing and why it is important. If I get lost, well, that's on you. The team that best presents itself, explains what it is doing, and makes me feel something (this is debate so I want emotion to be part of it, you are trying to convince me, you are a human, you are not a robot spouting out debate babble, it is your job to turn your rhetorical skills into a powerful, persuasive tool) will win the round.

I also like debaters that are eccentrically dressed. Over the last three years I have noticed that everyone, for the most part, wears the same, generic, ill-fitting clothes. I like it when people stand out. However, if you are wearing a top-hat and can't back it up with solid debate skills, then you're just looking foolish.

Best,

Tien
