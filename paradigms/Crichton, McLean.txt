I prefer substantive debate, because I think it's engaging, educational, and generally more exciting. That's really not an attempt at using a code word; substantive debate can take the form of traditional cases, case-specific kritiks, framework debates, and whatnot. I particularly like arguments centered around clear positions (distinctly ideological or otherwise). I am open to varying types of presentations -- slow, fast, etc. -- but if you're going to put out multiple answers or tell a complex line-by-line story, a clear big picture can really help in terms of clarity. I don't believe resolutional kritiks -- that is, kritiks that are not specific to the presentation made by one's opponent -- are valid arguments in an LD debate round that being said, I prefer a good standards debate.
