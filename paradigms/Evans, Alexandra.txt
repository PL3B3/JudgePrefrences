  Hi, i'm Alex "stanky leg" Evans AND I LOVE DEBATE!!!!!

My favorite round i ever debated in was my senior year. I dressed in assless leather chaps and performed "billie jean". PREF ME!!!!

Don't mind my lazy eye, i'm still paying attention to you!

My favorite arguement in debate was the Heidegger K. If you read it, i vote for you.

I like food, give me food and the round will go well for you. Preferably mexican, LATINA HERITAGE <3 XOXOXOXOXO. Don't be alarmed i've never shanked anyone, promise.

----editors note----
