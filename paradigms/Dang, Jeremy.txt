  I debated for four years for Strake Jesuit in Houston, Texas on both the national and local circuits and graduated in 2013.

I’m pretty much fine with whatever arguments you want to run, as long as you provide a clear evaluative mechanism for me to interpret your offense. I won’t paradigmatically disregard or prioritize any argument or type of argument. That being said, I probably won’t be as good at followingd ense theory debates as some other circuit judges, so if I ever look confused make sure you explain everything well. Please don’t be afraid to run unconventional frameworks or arguments, I’ll do my best to follow anything you want to run and won’t discriminate against any argument.

I’m not that great at flowing, and I’m pretty out of practice, but I’ll say speed and clear as well if I think you’re going too fast or too unclearly. I think speaker points should be used to reward good strategic decisions, and I reward them accordingly. 

Please feel free to ask me any other questions you may have.
