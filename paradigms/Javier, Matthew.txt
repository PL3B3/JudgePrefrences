  About me:
-On the Debate Society of Berkeley
-I have debated and judged the following debate styles: LD, Congress, Parliamentary, Public Forum, and Policy.
How I judge:
-I like debaters who have clear communication, good evidence and examples, and are civil during rounds. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't focus on the main idea of the resolution.
-Tabula Rasa, for the debate itself but not TR on the debate about the debate...T's and K's
What I like to see:
-Clash is central to BOTH sides.
-Link your ads/disads to impacts, then bring everything to the framework arena.
-Give and take POI's
-Last speech should be reserved for key points and voter issues. 
**Important notes for the abstract side (not framework but in the context of T's, K's, CP's, etc). This is where TR withers away...
-Counter-plans: Prefer that neg stick with SQ but hey CP's are fun too. Warning: I will be sympathetic to the aff, if CP isn't fair, Aff should go for a short T shell or perm it and move on.
-Only use theories and kritiks if you absolutely must! Not going to win the round with these alone. 
Theory: I don't like generic T shells. Only use them if you feel compelled enough to annoy me, unfairness is a good reason. Though, if you're actually a good debater then you don't need to hide behind a theory shell...Kritiks: These arguments need to be explained in the context of the AFF. If the links are generic and not contextualized, the perm is an easily compelling argument. Debates composed of mostly buzzwords and shallow explanation are painful. When AFF, answer all the K tricks, because if explained well they are very compelling. Specific analysis is more important than cards.-If you spread, I can only write down so much... Also, I am a sucker for speed K's.
