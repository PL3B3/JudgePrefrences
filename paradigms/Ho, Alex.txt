  Graduated Rowland Hall in 2013
Competed primarily in PF (Qualified to the TOC)

Currently a student at UC-Berkeley

Politically Independent

I primarily debated in PF in high school. I qualified to the TOC & NFL Nationals and went to a ton of tournaments. Despite competing in PF, I've judged policy for a variety of tournaments. You shouldn't go super fast, but I understand the importance and will do my best to flow. Iâ€™m an easygoing guy and I enjoy a variety of arguments but I still expect you to communicate clearly and justify your arguments. I rarely read evidence after a debate and I try to vote only on what was presented in the round.

Engage your opponent, present ideas that clash, and prove your impacts outweigh.

Please feel free to ask me questions before the round starts.
