I debated CX at Dulles HS in Sugar Land, TX for 4 years.

Initial Words - I always evaluate rounds based on the flow and try to minimize intervention. I am also in the process of getting acquainted with the topic this year. Strategy and technical skills will always boost your speaking points, messing up the flow does the opposite. Feel free to ask any specific questions.

Topicality/Theory - Impacts with proper internal links are necessary. If you want me to pull the trigger on this, the bulk of your final speeches should deal with this issue. I can be persuaded by either side.

Kritiks - Always explain your position clearly. Impact framing is huge for me. 

Speed - Any speed is fine, however you have to be clear if you want it on the flow.
