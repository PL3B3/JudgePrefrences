  I judged JV and Varsity rounds at the 2009 Harvard tournament, including nearly all of the JV outrounds. I have been trained by the Harvard Debate Team to judge debate. My personal debate experience has been in American Parliamentary debate and a bit of Public Forum, so I value argumentation and logical coherence over technicalities.
