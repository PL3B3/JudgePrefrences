        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        Topicality and Case

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Speak clearly

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Don't speak clearly

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        Topicality

        Theory
