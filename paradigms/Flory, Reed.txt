Been debating for four years, started with LD, so I understand the basics of it. I briefly delved into Varsity LD but quickly left because I didn't enjoy the largely progressive influence. I can understand and flow progressive ideas, but I don't particularly enjoy them. As such, if you want to treat me as a lay judge for the purpose this round, you'll probably have more success with me. I tend to favor strong argumentation over style, so my ballot will be decided on who I feel did the better job defending their case and attacking their opponents. Speaker points will be decided through style however. I feel Debate is supposed to be persuasive and if I don't feel as though you are being persuasive, I will not give you high speaker points. Furthering on this, I really don't like rudeness. You should always be cordial to your opponent and if I feel you are overly rude or aggressive I will dock speaker points. 

Speed - Moderate to Fast is okay, I will say "clear" if I don't understand you. If you run over time, I won't stop you, but I will stop flowing.

How I Judge the Round - I consider myself a flow judge through and through, and as such, argument extensions are one of the most important things you can do. Furthermore, make sure you're connecting everything in relation to your value and value criterion. As I stated earlier, speaker points are determined by persuasiveness, but I do personally believe that low-point wins are ok. As such, if I'm allowed to give low-point wins, I might if your opponent is more convincing than you. If not, go for argumentation over style.

My face is pretty expressive, so you will probably be able to judge how the round is going based on my facial expressions.

If you use the Merriam Webster Word of the Day, I will give you better speaker points. 

Good luck!
