now judge occasionally 

Quick Comments:
-unless told otherwise ill assume the ballot determines whether or not advocating the plan as an example of the resolution is a good idea given the methodology implied or explicitly stated in the round 
-be clear 
-be nice 
-be funny
 -don’t be sketchy 
-an argument is a claim (what your argument is), a warrant (why its true) and an implication (why that matters) 
-I'll only vote for arguments 
-if you are going for the k be clear about the specific link to the aff and the impact of that specific link 
–also, if winning the debate requires me altering my presumed role as the judge tell me what my new role is and why it's good
