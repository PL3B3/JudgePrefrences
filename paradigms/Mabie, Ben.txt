  Speed: I can flow speed well, but be reasonable. 

Kritiks: I'm not only familiar, but particularly agreeable to critical lines of argumentation. 

Theory: Theory debates rarely make for the best debates, but if you've got to run it, run it. Make sure that there is a strong abuse story, or I'll have difficulty voting on it. There needs to be a shell in order for me to consider the argument. 

Topicality: You'll need to prove that the affirmative interpretation makes the debate impossible, or nearly impossible for the negative team to win off topicality. Again, there needs to be a shell in order for me to consider the argument.

Projects/non-traditional debate: Debate is agency inscribing. Go for it.
