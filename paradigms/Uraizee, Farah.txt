  I have been judging LD for three years. Here are a few guidelines.
Was never a big debater with kritiks or theory, so probably don't run those on meI judge off the flow. I will do no work for you. Make sure to extend your arguments and refute the other sides. My decision comes into play based off of how well I think you defended your points or how well you knocked off your opponent's points.Speak at a normal pace (unless you can enunciate properly), don't spreadHighly value a clear framework and clear votersHighly value impacts with argumentsMake clear connection to your cardsWeigh your argumentsDon't be snarky. You will get lower speaker points if you are rude to one another.
