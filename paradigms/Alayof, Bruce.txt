  This is my second year judging, first year national circuit. I was very involved with policy debate during high school and did some judging during college, but this was many years ago. I am open to all forms of arguments, traditional and progressive, but you need to tailor to my level of experience. Be careful with speed, I am not sure I will be able to follow and flow full spreading. In final rebuttals, tell me why you have won the round.
