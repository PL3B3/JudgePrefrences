  Hi! I'm a Varsity Debater at Millburn High School. I'll probably be judging a few local tournaments in Novice and JV.

Arguments: I'm fine with any arguments as long as they are warranted (they don't have to be well-warranted). I'm not that well versed in K lit or high theory, but I'll evaluate it as best as I can. I won't vote on Disclosure though. Make sure you weigh between everything.

Speaks: Speed is fine, but include me on the email chain. I'll probably average 28.5, and feel free to ask me after round. I'm not afraid to give low-point wins either, and your speaks do not reflect how well I think you are going to do in the tournament; they reflect how you clear you are in round. If you spread someone less experienced out, then your speaks will reflect this; debate should be inclusive. 

Defaults:
Presume AffPermissibility flows NegTruth Testing ROBCompeting Interps"I meets" are implicit counter-interps (and trigger an RVI if you win RVI good)
