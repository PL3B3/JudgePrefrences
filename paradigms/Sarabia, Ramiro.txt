  Debated for three years in south Texas, primarily on the TFA circuit. Current student at Tufts University 

I like to enter debate rounds with a clean slate, and I’ll probably flow any argument you make in the round. With that said, don’t read something like Ashtar or Timecube in the round unless you really think you can convince me. 

Kritiks: I’m familiar with some of the more mainstream kritiks (cap, nietzsche, foucault, etc.). Feel free to read whatever you want, but a 2NC with a brief overview of the K would not be a bad idea if you want to be safe. As someone who is now looking at policy debate from the outside looking in, I appreciate a good Framework debate. 

Counterplans: I love a good counterplan + disad debate. 

Disads: They’re good. If you’re going to use debate jargon like double turn, I’d like for you to explain to me what the double turn is logically. I’m fine with the jargon and I will flow it, but debaters who can explain these arguments without using a lot of technical jargon will be rewarded with speaker points.

Topicality: T can be a voter if you make it a voter. For that, give me standards and why your standards outweigh. 

Other stuff: On-case debates are cool, just make sure to sign-post if you’re going for multiple advantages. I can flow spreading well; if I can’t hear, I’ll give you two times to adjust by shouting clear. If, after two times, you continue speaking at a rate where I can’t understand, I can’t promise to be able to flow everything. Rebuttals should be more than “my tag line answers your tag line;” give me analysis and tell me why this card answers the other one or why your argument is better than that card. Prep time ends when the flash drive leaves the laptop.
