  Policy Debater Since high school, also Judged Policy, LD, PF, and Worlds for the Houston Urban Debate League

I am a debater raised off of policy debate, then eventually trained in World Schools, Public Forum, and LD Debate. I am a judge who sees debates as a policymaker. When cases are presented to me, I like having the cases explained in detail for example: if you are working on the affirmative, explain how your plan helps the people at large, and if you are negative, explain how the affirmative plan is a bad idea and should not be passed. I like having my debaters comfortable because i feel they perform at their best when comfortable with their environment. I want a civil, clean, and respectful debate.
