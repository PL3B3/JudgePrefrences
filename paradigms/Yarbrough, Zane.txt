  This will be my 4th year on the debate circuit.

I started my sophomore year of high school. Competed in policy and PF. Currently I am a freshmen in college and competing on the college circuit in IPDA, NPDA.

What I like to see is a good debate, meaning; Road Map, Clash, Strong Arguments, Votes! 

I prefer a progressive style of debate. But with that being said, I will not pick you up just because you are progressive. FRAMEWORK- Set up the debate and tell me how i should weight the round, if you don't i will just do an argument drop/win weighing mechanism. After that give me your Voters! tell me why you out weight, tell me why I should sign you name on the ballet.

I am open to a T but I rarely vote on them. Now don't make the mistake of not running one when there is clearly abuse happening. K's are workable, not my favorite, but workable. If you do run a K then make sure you focus on the alt! If you don't then it just sounds like here say. Ontology is a hard thing to run with judges, you never know someones past. I will not take any of my personal situation in the round especially on how i weight the impacts. 

Other than that I am really quite open to a lot of things, I feel like pushing a boundary is a good way to attack. Experimentation is always nice to see and I will not discredit it just because it sounds crazy. Flush it out and I will flow. Although some of the best arguments are just the simple ones. 

Speaker points, I have never been a Strong believer in the speaker points for Debate. Therefore i am a very kind with speaker points. If you mess up, don't worry just make sure you got the argument all flushed out.
