  Judging Philosophy: Mari Vangen-Adams

Background: I did policy debate for South High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for 4 years. I attend University of Wisconsin Madison. This is my second year judging policy debate.

General: I lean towards a Policy framework. At the end of the round, I like a clear picture of what it means to vote for you. Make it clear which arguments I should look to first and why. I'm cool with a good amount of speed as long as you're clear. If I can't understand you I'll try and tell you.

Topicality: Topicality is about competing interpretations. You don't need to prove abuse, I will vote on jurisdiction type arguments. 

Theory: If your going to go for it it can't be blippy and the abuse needs to be clearly explained. I really dislike Aspec, but if you really want to run it, know you won't win on it unless the Aff seriously messes up.

Kritiks: I am not a K hack. I didn't read very many K's when I debated. This does not mean that I won't vote for kritiks, it just means that unless you are very clear, I may not vote the way you want me to. Impact how the 1ac functions in the debate. I’ll listen to the framework debates, but I’d rather just hear the perm, impact turns, and offense against the alternative.

Counter Plans: I LOVE counter plan debates! Counterplans don’t have to be non-topical, but they do have to be competitive. Perms are a test of competition but if the perm is the best option at the end of the round then I'll vote aff.

Performance: a warning, I have little to no experience with performance, make sure you clearly explain the role of the ballot.
