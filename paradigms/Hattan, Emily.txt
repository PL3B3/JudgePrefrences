  Background:
Debated for 2 years at the Barstow School and I am a sophomore. I know about the topic and I have read plenty of arguments about it.

Arguments I like:
I enjoy topicality as long as it is well explained and not rushed. The terror disad is my favorite mostly because it is relevant and easy to explain. I also like counterplans as long as they are well explained and can be compared to the other team’s argument.

Arguments I don’t like:
I don’t really like the politics disad and TPP because I think it is a waste of time, I don’t think it matters and I have heard it too many times so I think it’s a bit boring. The only time I enjoy listening to K debates is when both teams understand the argument and can explain it in detail, or else it just gets confusing and then it’s not fun to listen to.
I like when both teams explain their arguments because it shows that they understand what they are talking about and not just reading off of a screen and it’s also just more entertaining. I enjoy listening to debates where both teams are enthusiastic about what they are talking about, and I am fine with speed reading as long as it is clear and understandable. During cross-x don’t be mean to your opponents and try to use up as much time as possible. Line by line is also important and I like when teams explain why they should win the round.
