Please put less emphasis on what the author of your card says and present more analysis. 

I have judged for 3 years at local debate tournaments for Rancho Bernardo, so I am familiar with debate, but I am a parent, so please speak slowly, do not spread. If you do, I will be unable to follow you, and therefore able to evaluate your arguments. Please make sure that you explain each argument clearly as well as the impact of the argument. 

I prefer debate about the topic rather than complex debates about philosophy, so while you may argue philosophy in front of me, please don't make it the sole focus of the round, and explain it clearly and in terms that any normal person could understand.

If you want me to vote for something, you have to do sufficient analysis and explain the function of the argument and why you want me to vote for it. I will not vote on a 5 second argument with no explanation behind it.
