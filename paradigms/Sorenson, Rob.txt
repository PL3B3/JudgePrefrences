  I'm a traditional judge - I consider the value/criteria debate to be
most important. Your contentions should flow naturally from your VC
and should be clearly and intentionally related. I'm quite skeptical
of theory and kritiks, so if you want to run these, you will need also
to argue convincingly as to why I should vote on these sorts of
things. I expect debaters to actually engage the resolution, rather
than trying to redefine or avoid the commonsense intention of the
resolution.

Don't try to spread. I value clarity, fluency, and eloquence and have
limited tolerance for speed. I will not vote for a debater whose case
I cannot easily follow and flow.
