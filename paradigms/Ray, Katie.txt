  My Judging Philosophy 
I usually judge Public Forum. I like traditional debate. I dislike speed. You must be clear on where you are on the flow. I dislike low-point wins but will occasionally award them. I like for you to pre-empt your his/her last speech and give a very specific decision calculus within the round that tells me how I should weigh and the reasons I should vote for you over your opponent (not simply why I should not vote for your opponent).
If you do your job well, I won't have to "decide" who won and why; you'll have already made that crystal clear.
I strongly dislike unsportsmanlike conduct, i.e. being rude to your opponent.
Regarding Speed: Go slowly. If you want to use speed, you must be clear, or I won't have it on my flow and will therefore not evaluate if it's brought up in your next speech. My threshold for speed is 50%. 
SIGN POST LIKE CRAZY, even in your rebuttals! Tell me which flow you're on, and where it is on the flow by point, subpoint, and card. 
Define what you're doing and why it's relevent to the round and tell me when I have to evaluate any specific arguments before looking to the rest of the case, etc. (OR when I shouldn't have to). 
I'm open to questions before the round starts as long as both debaters are present.

CX: GO SSSSLLLLOOOOOWWWWLLLLYYY. I'm a high school English teacher who likes well-articulated arguments and CLEAR LINKS. I need you to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, as this is probably the first time I have EVER heard about it. . If you go fast, it will be a toss-up for the winner.
