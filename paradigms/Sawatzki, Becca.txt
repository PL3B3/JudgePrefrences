I didn't debate in high school, but my parents are both debate coaches so I'm familiar with debate fundamentals. 

I would request that you speak conversationally, avoid theoretical arguments, and clearly explain and impact your arguments. If you want to run theory, topicality, critical arguments, etc please do so at your own risk and realize that you will need to spend a more significant portion of your time explaining your argument in addition to its function. 
I will award higher speaker points for soccer references.
