  I am the sister of a first year debater. I understand some, but not all lingo to debate so some explanations may be necessary.


I like traditional mostly, but spewing will be tolerated if you are understandable.

I hate k arguments and will most likely vote against you if you attempt a k against your opponent if i am judging (as well as I am not families with many theory arguments.)

I will be voting on your pervasiveness in an argument, and arguments not brought up will not be flowed.
