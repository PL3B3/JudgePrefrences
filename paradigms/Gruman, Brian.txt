  As a Judge, I am Tabla Rosa. I make my decisions solely on the round that I see. I may make comments on things that you could do differently, but these have no bearing on my win/loss decision.
I base my decision on the argumentation in the round. Claims warrants and impacts. Make sure that your warrants speak to why your claim is a true one. On impacts, don’t just tell me why your thing is good or bad, but actually compare it with that of your opponent. Compare the factors of risk such as, probability, duration, depth, breadth, chance of recovery etc.
The only paradigm/issue that I won’t vote on are ones that call for questionable in round ethical behavior like stripping and racist jokes.
