What I ask is simple: I am looking for a clear and coherent story. Personally, I think this is best achieved by a traditional V/VC debate with a logical claim-warrant-impact structure, but I'm open to other case forms as well. As long as you can explain your argument, prove why it's true, and make me feel like it's necessary over your opponent's, I don't really care how you do it. Bonus speaker points for making the round entertaining.

Some things to note:
If you are going to use theory, you had better make it clear why.If you are going to speed, it must be necessary. Don't make me flow fast and you end up with 30 seconds left in the AC.When it comes to spreading, quality over quantity. If you're giving a five-fold reason not to vote for someone, they better all be good.Don't give me that Latin stuff unless it's warranted and absolutely necessary.I like cards, but tell me why they are warranted, and don't forget to impact them.I don't believe in "defaulting neg." That's just stupid.
Oh, and please respect your opponent. Optional to respect the judge(s), but we're the ones signing the ballots. :)

I'll be happy to answer any additional questions you have before the round begins.
