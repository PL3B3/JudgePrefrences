  I did policy debate at Greenhill for four years. I like to hear clear arguments about impact calculus and impact frameworks. Explain why I should prefer magnitude or probability, etc. I am open to most arguments as long as you can defend the theory behind them. However, I will usually not vote for teams who read a plan that is not topical. I like to hear discussions about the quality of the evidence. Explain why the source is qualified and why the warrants behind the argument are legitimate. Speed is fine with me as along as you are clear.
