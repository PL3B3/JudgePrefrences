  I'm an experienced parli debater (with a WSDC background), winning top ESL speaker at WUDC 2013 and breaking into octos for Harvard.

I vote off the flow. When presenting your arguments, know that I can handle a reasonable amount of speed, but there's a threshold to what I can write down myself. That said, please be sure to slow down for your taglines so I can flow those clearly. Moreover, do not go fast if you cannot speak clearly; if I can't understand you, I will not flow your argument.I'm happy with stock cases. I'm also fine with more creative arguments, but please don't say crazy things. Signposting and internal structure is absolutely necessary. Not signposting or having a disorganized case that hinders the progress of the round will cost you speaker points. Be polite, and have fun. Remember that you and your opponent are not deadly enemies after the round, and make it an enjoyable experience.
