  I coached for four years at New Trier High School and three at Edina High School. I stopped coaching in 2013. I am currently a prosecutor with the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.

While I used to judge frequently, I am at the point where I judge once a year at a local sectional tournament. Please don't go full speed or assume I know all the lingo. I am out of the loop. That said, I will not penalize you for doing your thing, whether that's critical arguments or policy stuff or theory. Just make it clear.

Most importantly, have fun and learn things!

Any other questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
