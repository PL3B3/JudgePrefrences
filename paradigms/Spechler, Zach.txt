  Hi, my name is Zach Spechler

This is my first year of coaching debate. I do not know much about the activity. I have seen a couple practice rounds. I have a JD. Don't go very fast in front of me as I am not very good at flowing. I want to be persuaded.

If you have any more questions about my paradigm ask me in round.
