  Summary: Don't spread. Bring out lay cases and use very clear argumentation and simple and not complex, theoretical arguments. Be calm, clear, and polite and you will get good speaks.

I am simply a parent of a debater and do not have any experience in local or competitive debate circuits. I have judged LD, though mostly JV and lay, for 1.5 years. I also judged parliamentary debate for 1 year and middle school debate for one year.

I do flow the debate, although my flow may not have all the small, in-between argument analytics that you say. I will do my best to follow you, but absolutely cannot handle speedy or overly complex debate. I would prefer conversational speed but can deal up to 200 words per minute. I will ask you to slow down by saying SPEED or simply by having a confused look on my face (You will need to look up and notice this and see that I have stopped flowing) and to speak clearer by saying CLEAR. I have a very traditional paradigm and will not vote on theoretical argumentation (unless it can be explained with a minimum amount of jargon and the abuse is incredibly clear), pre-standards voting issues, kritiks, a prioris, disads, topicality. If you feel that it is necessary to use these techniques, you will need to explain what is happening in the round, what these techniques are, and why they are necessary. Using any of these techniques abusively will result in low speaks. I like straightforward, util debate. If you run fancy criterions like emotivism, you better have a very simple way of explaining it or I will not vote on it and may also give you low speaks. When assigning speaker points, I look for respect, fluidity, tone, body movement, and courtesy. Interesting and clearly well-thought-out positions will also be rewarded, but offensive arguments will be punished. Do not hesitate to ask or clarify on any of these points.
