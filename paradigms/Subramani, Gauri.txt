  I debated for four years at Hopkins High School in Minnesota and I competed on the national circuit.

Set up burdens clearly, whether you use a criterion or a different kind of framework. Telling a consistent story throughout the round makes everything easier and more enjoyable for all of us, and make sure you say why your arguments matter (i.e., link to a standard). Be explicit about where I should vote and remember to impact and weigh your arguments- I don't want to have to intervene or make links. 
I'm not a fan of theory unless there's a clear violation, and using theory to confuse your opponent or to waste her/his time is not ok. Please don't be rude to your opponent or use bad arguments that you know are bad but are “strategic”, as doing so will cost you a lot of speaker points. If you are hugely offensive, I will drop you. 
Clarity is very important- I can handle speed but if what you say isn't on my flow, I'm not going to consider it. 

Feel free to ask me any questions before the round; I'm happy to clarify my preferences.
