  Debated for Fort Lauderdale for four years, and for West Georgia for three. 

Feel comfortable reading whatever arguments you want in front of me, as long as you’re able to create clash and explain the story of your argument coherently. Impact calculus is important, whether you are reading a critical argument or a politics DA, it is always helpful when you explain how I should evaluate the debate. 

I won’t read a lot of cards unless there is an ongoing discussion about the warrants within them. Which means if you extend a tag with no warrant, I will not go back and find one—it also means if you want me to flow warrants from the start, you should speak clearly and loudly.

Framework/theory- please give me a terminal impact to these arguments- fairness/ground is not a terminal impact. I would like to know why it matters for the activity when debates aren’t fair, or when you don’t have predictable ground.

Heads up- I haven’t been active in the circuit for this topic, so please don’t assume that I know the lingo and abbreviations associated with the resolution.
