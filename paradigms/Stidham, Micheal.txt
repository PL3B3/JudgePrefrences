  I have been involved with high school forensics since 1978. I currently work as the part time director for debate at St. John's School Houston and as the UIL middle school debate tournament director for Houston ISD.

I am a traditional LD judge who favors value/criterion arguments. I prefer philosophical arguments rather than overuse of evidence and although I am open to theory, it must be explained so that I can comprehend. When asked about my paradigm, I will tell debaters to "follow the yellow brick road" as in The Wizard of Oz. I look for brains (logic), courage (clash), and heart (pathos). As it comes to speed, the debaters should look up every once and in awhile and make sure I am still with them.
