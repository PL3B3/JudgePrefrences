I'm a progressive LD judge. I hate the idea of a judge paradigm. I don't believe my preference should determine what is presented in the round. I am not prejudice against any issue, nor do I prefer certain issues over others.

The expectation for any round is that you present well formed arguments, provide support for your case, and refute your opponents case. I am handle any speed you can deliver, however it is your responsibility to be clear.

I vote strictly off my flow. If you are not clear, I do not flow. I will not tell you to clear up, it is your job to know if you are being an effective communicator. Likewise, if you don't tell me where to flow something (for example, on my opponents second contention), I will flow it strict down -which may not bode well for you.

In any round, you need to give me a reason to prefer you. Impact your arguments. Well formed, quality arguments will be reflected in speaker points.
