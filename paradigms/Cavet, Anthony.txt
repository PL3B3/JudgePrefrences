  I prefer colorful, persuasive oratory delivered at a quick conversational rate as a vehicle for analyzed facts and I hope for language and as free of specific jargon as possible, so that debate can be accessible to the general public and not be what we call in mathematics a self-referential closed set. I started judging debate in 1970 and consider most of the past 40 years as an evolution away from the educational ideal. I remember that LD and PFD were created IN PART as a response to people who agreed with me about what was happening in debate at the time. I have a large problem with Kritiks.
