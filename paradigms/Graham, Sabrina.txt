 I formerly debated policy at Monticello High School in NY in the 90's. I'm now teaching and coaching there. I have found myself judging LD more frequently than policy this year and I find it quite enjoyable. As an LD judge I can handle speed but I honestly appreciate the traditional style of LD (values and standards do matter). If you are going to run theory please structure it with an interpretation, standards and voters. If you like to run critisisms please understand the philosophy and the implication. You do need an alternative if you want to win. The farther I am removed from debate the easier it is to intervene less. I would like to think that I vote on the flow, but as we all know sometimes that is impossible. I really appreciate good 1AR's and NR's so feel free to wow me.

As a poilcy judge I would appreciate it if your cards actually had warrants and have some knowledge of alternative energy. Again I vote on the flow but keep in mind I love a good T debate.
