  Hello, i am an exPofo competitor of 4 years from Monta Vista high School.

My partner and i broke to berkeley, and stanford each year that we attended, so i am more than proficient in what constitutes sufficient argumentation.

Be sure to compare impacts in a way other than just comparing bigger numbers, and set up a clear way for me to evaluate arguments in the round.

I know Grand cross fire usually is very loud, but i want teams to remain calm and stay respectful without yelling at each other. I found it rude when i debated, and i still find it rude now.

I also will not tolerate any lying about evidence, and i will call for the evidence if it is contested during the round. then i will proceed to tank the speaker points of the offending team.
