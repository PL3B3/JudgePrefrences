  I debated for Glenelg High School with Capitol Debate and debated at Harvard through junior year. Have not judged on this year's topic yet.

Run whatever arguments you want to. I try to minimize judge intervention so tell me what to do, what's good, what's acceptable, etc. I do not reject any arguments on face. I prefer a fleshed out debate about the link/impacts of an argument than a "they dropped it". This is especially true for theory. I was primarily a policy-oriented debater in high school, less so in college which means I haven't read all the K lit, but I have no predisposition against Ks/performance. Because I've been out of the activity for a few years, I'm coming back in without a lot of context for this topic and for any major developments in the activity in the last few years so please make any expectations you have of me clear.
