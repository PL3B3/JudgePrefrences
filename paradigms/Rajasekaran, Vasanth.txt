  Hi all, My name is Vasanth 
Details about me 
- Debated 3 years for Lexington High School
- Did LD all 3 years but know how Policy works 
- First Year out
- Email: vrajasekaran@tulane.edu
Prefs
-- LARP/Util- 1
-- Tricks- 1
-- Theory/T-1
-- K-1
-- High Theory- 4
-- Phil- 3
Paradigmatic Issues:

-- I won't vote for anything that's not warranted-- that being said, the standard for what is enough of a warrant can be debated and I will listen to arguements that seek to define it

-- I default to Competing Interps/drop the debater, and RVIs

-- The only arguments I won't vote on are oppression/racism/sexism good type args (+ unwarranted stuff), which includes asking your opponent to justify why racism/sexism/etc is bad

-- I don't like cheating -- disclose, don't clip, don't bracket in spikes into your cards-- I will vote for disclosure Theory 9.9/10 times so unless you think you are a god at theory ( I have yet to meet one) then you should disclose. Loss to Disclose theory wont get you more than a 27.5 speaks

-- Flex prep is a given

-- Flashing/emailing isn't prep -- compiling the speech doc is

-- 1AR extensions dont have to be great, if there is a meaningful mention of the arguement I will extend it 

-- I'm fine with speed and I'll say clear if I need to
This is similar to Emmiee Malyugina's^^
Positions:
Non-T Affs: These are fine, I read one my senior year and I understand where they come from. That being said I went for T a lot and thus get both sides of the debate so I am open to either way just debate it well
Ks: I only read Ks my second year and read them a good amount my 3rd year. They are fine unless they are high theory. I didnt read a single piece of high theory during High school and dont plan on to in the future so I wont really be able to follow the debate, but of course you can read it infront of me. Ks dont need an Alt but if they dont, explain what I am voting for or why I am voting. The Role of the Ballot is a framework
LARP: I liked Util debate a lot, didnt get to do much of it cause no one in the Northeast gets it. Make sure to do weighing since its really essential to this type of debate
Phil: I have read a little bit of kant on every topic, I read it as a time suck and didnt really ever go for it but I do get the concepts of Kant. any other non-util phil should probs be explained, esp how it interacts with the other framework.
Theory: What ever shell is fine. Im fine with theory as a strat because I understand not everyone has answers to every aff. I dont really think I will cut speaks for abusive shells cause absusive shells are usually bad and if you are winning a bad shell then you deserve the win (Unless its a novice or someone that clearly doesnt know theory, in which case i might cut some speaks but not too much). I default to RVIs because RVIs are probs good but of course you can debate that. 
Tricks: Its fine, phil tricks might be harder to understand, explain them well
Other things:
-2NR Ks like trigger warning DAs and Gendered Language Ks are very hard to evaluate since they are read so late. Reading them doesnt mean Auto win and I will listen to the 2AR and to be honest since its so late and the 2AR is so time crunched I wont be harsh on the 2A and give them some credance because lets be honest unless one reads one of these arguments for 5 minutes in the 2N its an unfair positive time trade off that will kill the 2AR. That all being said if there is a proven incident before the round in which certain preferances on these matters were given or asked for, then I am more than happy to vote neg.
