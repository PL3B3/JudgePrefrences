Overall, debaters should be polite and respectful, but most importantly enjoy what they are doing. I'm pretty much okay with most arguments, even seemingly ridiculous ones as I have heard my share, as long as they are justified in round intelligently. 

Some specifics

Theory: For theoretical objections such as conditionality and most counterplan theory I tend to err neg, and for topicality I tend to err aff, but as long as debaters explain thoroughly the arguments you should be fine. Debaters should make sure to impact theoretical objections and tell me how I should evaluate the round, or else I'm usually not obligated to decide the round on a theory arg. 

Counterplans: I don't have a problem with most counterplans, and I have read my share of some theoretically objectionable ones so I know the ins and outs. With that said, debaters need to make sure to impact well and explain how the two options interact. 

Kritiks: I read my share of kritiks in high school as well so I won't be opposed to anything as long as it's explained well. As far as critical literature goes, I probably won't know every single term or reference; debaters should be sure to explain something if it isn't easily understood already. 

With that said, I debated seriously for 4 years of high school, and have seen my share of arguments and rounds. As long as you impact why your harms are more significant, everything will be fine. I will not be automatically opposed to 99% of arguments, and I believe it's up to the debaters to explain those issues in round for me.
