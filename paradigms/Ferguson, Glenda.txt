General Comments: I expect you will be agressive, but that doesn't mean you can't be polite. I want to be able to hear you so be sure that you don't cover your face with your computer. On speed - slow down a little for me and make sure that if something is important that you underline it with your voice. I'll let you know if you aren't clear.

I will listen to any argument, but I expect it to be coherent. I am not a fan of theory arguments, but I will vote on it if you win the argument.

I expect good impact calculus: links on critiques and an alternative; and evidence or the lack thereof, is very important. Do not tell me that the card says something that it doesn't.

I try not to intervene, so it is up to you to win the debate.
