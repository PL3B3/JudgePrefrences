  I am curently a first year masters student at UNI. I was a 4 year debater in highschool for LeMars (Iowa), I also debated for 2 of my 3 undergrad years at UNI. I would say that I am open to any arguments and in my 8 years around debate I have seen or heard just about everything. I default as a policy maker, but will adopt a different framework if a team argues it. I am a big fan of disad cp debates, but am just as willing to listen to anyother type of debate. I like to think that I have no prefrances to voting one way or another on any given argument. I think that any team can run any type of argument in front of me so long as the argument is well developed and properly explained, my biggest pet peeve is when a team runs arguments that they are not comfortable running in an effort to please judges, just debate where you are comfortable.
