  I debated in high school (Congress) for 2 years. My education background: undergrad from USC and grad school at University of Chicago both in cinema and media studies. I’ve worked as a professor for two years and so most of my familiarity with critiquing debate is in the context of roundtable academic discussion. Evidence and arguments presented as narratives that I can easily visualize and empathize with appeal to my own occupational bias. 

I’ll listen to any reasonable arguments as long as they are researched and supported with clearly articulated citations. I do not prefer high-speed debate. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being as fast as possible, I prefer a debate in the 3-4 range. I’ll flow the debate, but if I cannot follow it, I won’t flow what I can’t follow. Make it easy for me by NOT spreading, NOT running complex framework, and using well placed sign posts and keywords.


I also prefer a debate on the actual resolution. While I can appreciate a reasonable amount of time being dedicated to clearly articulating definitions, the focus of the debate should not be on paradigms (framework). Real-life, real-world arguments with their impacts are critical to the debate.
