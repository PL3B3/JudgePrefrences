  I debated two years at a junior college and two years at Cal. I am comfortable judging all types of debates and am willing to vote on pretty much anything. I judge the rebuttals more so on the logical force of the arguments being made rather than the number of arguments supporting a position/pieces of evidence so deep explanations are key. It's not enough to say that you have X pieces of evidence or that you have X number of arguments on a specific flow. Besides that, anything goes. Happy debating.
