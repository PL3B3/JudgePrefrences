  Hey. I debated for Harvard-Westlake for four years. I qualified to the TOC my junior and senior years.

I will vote on pretty much anything. Don't be offensive and make smart arguments and you will get high speaks.

Just a note I haven't debated LD in a while so please go slow. I also was never that great at flowing anyways so thats another reason you should go slow.

But really it is your activity feel free to run theory (even if it's stupid), kritiks, a prioris, whatever. Have fun!
