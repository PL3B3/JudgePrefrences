Speakers should be organized and provide a road map. Tags should be clearly stated and concise. I'm old school and don't like spreading. If you speak so fast that I don't catch your arguments, then it's your bad, not mine. I believe that this activity should teach speaking skills and improve an individual's ability to persuade. Spreading does neither.

I'm open to any argument as long as it is explained clearly. Give me impacts and voters. Judges who sum up many of my thoughts on debate: Ben Fagan, Iain Lampert.
