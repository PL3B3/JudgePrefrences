Please be nice.
Theory
Make sure you explain the implications of your interpretations. If you can avoid making theory
debates simply inconclusive you'll be rewarded.
Framework
I see debate as a game of conventions rather than rules per se. That said, i think a lot of people
"cheat." And the only thing worst than cheating is losiing because you let someone get away
with it. If you think the aff needs to defend a plan, call them out. Pushing the "rules" of debates
to include/exclude certain arguments is a strategy some work and some don't.
Topicality.
I love these debates. I think most topicality debates seem shallow. You should focus on the
implication of your interpretation as a whole. I find myself inclined toward competing
interpretations because these lines of argument are rarely questioned. That really just means they
should be.
Counterplans
I really like creative pics. Strategic counterplanning is rewarded well.
Critique business
Plese just make the debate simple. I think most people get so obscure in their use of language
that these debates are painful. Creative metaphors and specific examples grounded teh context of
the debate is a very effective tool with me.
