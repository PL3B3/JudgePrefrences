  I debated for four years in policy at UCLab. Do whatever you want. I read Ks and sometimes policy stuff. Go for presumption and infinite case turns. I think zero risk is a thing. Teach me. I know some stuff about some stuff, but I do my best to construct each team's argument based exclusively off of what was said in-round. I might know something about the aff you're reading, but if you explain it in a way that makes no sense, I'm gonna tell you it makes no sense. Internal links are important, but don't exist. CX is cool. Know more about everything than everyone else in the room. When you don't, pretend you do. Have fun.
