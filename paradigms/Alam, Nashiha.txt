I only have judged a limited amount of rounds on the topic, and am not as familiar as you all are.

The important stuff:
I will not dock you points for being aggressive, but I will not give you points for being so either.I will vote on anything as long as it is extended throughout the round and has a reasonable voter.I do have a high threshold on theory.No multiple worlds in the 2NR.Don't make me have to do the work for you. Please do evidence comparison.
The less important stuff:
If you ask me to call out a certain time beforehand, note that I'm very forgetful.Please don't call me "judge" so much.I am OK with tag team CX but I expect a reasonable and respectful amount of intervention from partners.I do not take prep for flashing, but if I see you strategizing, or whispering with your partner, I will be very sad. :( So please don't? It confuses me, and I don't like being a mean judge.That being said, prep means prepping. NO PREP STEALING.If you're using your phone as a timer, that does not mean you can text, or take a call, or any other non-timer things on it.Have fun! You decide whether or not debate is fun.
