Ms. Ramakrishnan is an experienced parent judge. Though she has had exposure to numerous LD rounds and high level debates, her judging style tends toward strong analysis and logic, and away from theory. She does not like spread-style debating, and persuasiveness and reasoning will be a large factor in her ballot.
