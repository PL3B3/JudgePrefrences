Speed: Coming back as a judge, I haven't been in a round where speed has been an issue. I will yell "clear" twice, after that it is up to you to determine if I am flowing.

Casing: No preference in the type of case you run in front of me, however, if you are running something that skews away from the stock, it is in your best interest to slow down and emphasize what is important.

Theory: If no justification, I assume competing interpretations. However I am open to whatever framework that is justified in round (i.e. reasonability). Just be clear on how you want the ballot to function.

Feel free to ask specific questions before the round - I tend to find that more fruitful.
