  I debated for three years at New Trier High School in Winnetka Illinois and I currently attend the University of California, Berkeley. 

My philosophy on debate:
It is up to the debaters to make the round what they want it to be. I will vote on anything as long as it is justified. Having said that, I prefer arguments that are warranted and detailed weighing would be appreciated. I am fine with speed as long as it is clear. I base my speaker points on coherency, word economy, time management, and entertainment.
