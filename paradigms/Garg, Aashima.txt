  Debated for The Hockaday School (Class of 2015) in Dallas, TX for four years in LD. University of Texas at Austin Cockrell School of Engineering Class of 2019.

UPDATE 10/17
-extend every argument you want me to evaluate. even if the argument dropped or conceded, make a blippy extension.

 READ A FRAMEWORK
 {paraphrasing Leah Shapiro’s paradigm}
 note: these are just preferences, i will not intervene on these issues.
 -i love framework debate and analytic philosophy.
 -“consequentialism” and “ maximizing net benefits” aren’t enough to justify util. 
-don’t read impact-justified standards (e.g. preventing terrorism).
 -weigh between framework preclusion arguments.
 -role of the ballot isn’t a (normative) framework. i like normative frameworks. 
 -i find critical philosophy interesting, but i don’t understand it very well, and i think most of it is unwarranted. explain K lit very clearly to me. (see Ks section for more info on this.)
 -i intuitively know that racism is bad, so in a normal conversation you obviously wouldn't need to justify that to me. debate rounds are different though; you can't rely on my intuition about bad impacts. they must be grounded in a normative framework.

 THEORY
-i like good theory and T debates.
-i default drop the argument.
 -i default reasonability.
 -if you run AFC, i will give the framework to the NEG. so, probably don’t read AFC in front of me.
 -DO NOT READ: flash theory, disclosure theory, or speed theory in front of me. i will stop flowing, and i will not vote on it.
update: you can read flash theory or disclosure theory with an extremely legitimate violation in front of me (e.g. your opponent flashed you the wrong case and refused to flash you the correct one after asking for it).

 Ks
 -i am not well versed in critical philosophy (but i am interested in it), so only run a K if you can explain it very well.
 -saying "roll of the ballot” does not mean your arguments magically take over the top layer of the debate. this phrase means nothing to me unless it is very well warranted.
-i default theory > K if there is no weighing as to which takes the top layer of the debate in round. 

 POLICY
-i’m probably not the best judge for you if you’re one of the best util debaters out there.
 -slow down in these types of debates.
 -explain jargon to me. 

 TRICKS
 {paraphrasing Danny DeBois’ paradigm}
 -if an argument's function is clear in the first speech, I'm much likelier to vote on it. So, don’t be sketchy.
 -if you're debating a tricky case and you think the arguments your opponent is "extending" are totally new, feel free to make new responses and hope that I agree with you.
 -i like debaters who can beat tricky cases either substantively or with smart theory shells.

 SPEED/SPEAKER POINTS
 -read as fast as you want, but SLOW DOWN for card names, tags, theory/t interps, and plan/CP/alt texts.
 -i’ll say “clear” and/or “slow” three times before I deduct speaker points.
 -WATCH ME: my facial expressions should let you know if you’re too fast or too confusing.
 -speaker points drop if you don’t sign post, if you’re rude, or if you are offensive.
 -bonus points if you wear something preppy or if you make me laugh :-) 

ask me any additional questions before round.
