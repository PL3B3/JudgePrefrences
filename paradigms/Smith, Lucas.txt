EDIT LEXINGTON 16: IF YOU ASK YOUR OPPONENT TO FLASH BEFORE THE ROUND YOU WILL NOT GET A 30. I think flashing is really dumb, what happened to reading over peoples shoulders to intimidate them? Is everyone that bad at flowing these days that everything needs to be flashed? Can't you just look at your opponents case during prep time? I will never understand the flashing movement. It literally just wastes so much time.

ALSO, if you flash before you come into the room, I would never know, and I would like you a lot better for not wasting 5+ minutes before the round just to flash a damn case.

honestly, I apologize that flashing infuriates me so much

Edit Newark 2016: I notice every time I edit this paradigm it gets shorter, I'm not going to write paragraphs about my debate preferences; Do the better debating, and you'll win.

THINGS I WILL NOT VOTE FOR (No, I'm not "tab")
- Things with no warrants
- Disclosure theory
- In the aff- “All neg interps must be phrased as counter interps because the aff implicitly assumes theory interps” if you run this, and it is your strat to win, STRIKE ME I WILL GIVE YOU A ZERO AND A LOSS.
- I just learned what "Bracket Theory" was.... that too

Things I find annoying:
-AFC
-more than like 2 theory spikes in the AC
-Hella tricky cases (minorly tricky is OK, but don't be a douche)
- when really good theory debaters run BS theory on kids who obviously are unfamiliar with the theory
- Bostrom is so bad it hurts.
-AFC
-grammar standards in shells. I don't understand grammar I guess.

make smart arguments, don't recite cards

Be silly, Have fun.
