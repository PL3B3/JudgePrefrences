  Hey everyone! Columbia 2016 will be my first contact with debate besides my roommate Paul Zhou talking about debate a bit. Paul has given me a basic run down of how debate judging works but I am not going to be able to flow speed, understand debate jargon, or follow non-traditional case structures. I'm a lay judge and you should treat me as such. As a reference for speed, Paul and I flowed a debate online as practice (the round can be found here: https://vimeo.com/6109055) and I found that the AC was slightly too fast for me to flow comfortably. Here are some things that would help me flow better:
enunciatepause briefly between argumentsslow down and emphasize the value criteriongive me time to move between parts of the flow when you signpost.
Also, I am currently a junior at Wesleyan University and am studying Science and Technology Studies. What that means is academically I have some engagement with noeliberalism, Marxism, and biopower as they relate to public health and medicine. However, please don't assume I'm familiar with any other critical literature as a result of this. I also have no experience with most moral philosophy except utilitarianism. Academically I tend to be more concerned with the practical applications of theory rather than theory for theory's sake. In debate terms that means I am more likely to latch on to arguments about the topic itself as opposed to abstract philosophy. I consider myself left-leaning politically for what it's worth.

This paradigm was written by Paul Zhou with Miles' approval.
