  I used to do Lincoln-Douglas on the circuit in high school.

I'll vote for very nearly anything as long as the debater making the argument justifies the chain of logic every step of the way back to my ballot. Off-topic arguments, interpretive dance, performances, anything goes. If you're particularly worried, you can ask me before the round. The only qualm I have is theory used to do something other than to check abuse. At the moment, I'm leaning towards not liking it, but I can definitely see myself being convinced to vote for it.

I'll try my best to call "clear" if your speed is too much for me. This most likely shouldn't be a problem unless you're doing a page a minute (actually something more like 350 wpm is where you'll start losing me).

One thing that all judges say and that I understand so clearly now is that debaters don't impact their arguments enough. Tell me what they do in terms of the round as you make them; don't wait for the end of your last speech to throw in a bunch of implications for what you've said for the past half an hour. Weigh arguments against each other, tell me where links are forged and die, etc.

I probably average around 27.5-28 for speaker points. For more points, I'm looking for good debate -- efficient time management, responsive arguments, an easy to follow ballot story, and just a bit of brilliant cleverness.
