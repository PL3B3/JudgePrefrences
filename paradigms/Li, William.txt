I did Lincoln-Douglas Debate (along with parli and congress) in high school for two years, mostly local tournaments. Therefore, though I find myself with enough experience to understand how all debates work, I am not well versed with theory or kritiks though I am inclined to hear you out if you make coherent explanations. No messy theory debates please. Most importantly, just make sure all your arguments have a claim, warrant, and impact. Make sure you clarify the impacts and emphasize their importance. If you can do that, you're halfway there to my vote.

Speaking preferences: I will make every effort to flow the entire debate. That said, I would rather judge the quality than the quantity of the arguments. Please refrain from spreading (go maybe 75-80% of your top speed) and I will call out to slow down if need be. If you enunciate and articulate your words well I should have no problem keeping up. It would be nice to signpost your arguments and maintain a logical flow and structure. Crystallization at end is nice. Also indicate clearly the start and end of your cards.

Show me what arguments should be prioritized, how they should be weighted, what links to what. I'd like some straight-up good debating: be courteous to your opponent during cross-examination, and have fun with it (that will get you more speaker points). Explain everything even if you think it is a waste of time; don't just say extend this or that just because it is obvious to you, claim warrant impact!
