Experience -
Debated for 4 years in high school (Privacy, WMD, Mental Health, and Ocean Policy Topics)
2nd year College Debater (Energy Policy and Supreme Court)
Judged at Ohio Valley, Michigan, UGA this year

Things you should take into account -

Topic Knowlege - I have judged at only a few high school tournaments (Michigan, Ohio Valley, UGA). That being said, trends, resolutional wording, acronyms and terminology specific to the resolution should be explained more for me then other judges.

Theory - If you think you are winning it more then other arguments in the debate, don't hesitate to go for it. I wont hold anything against you if you do.

Ks - I am not well read when it comes to most K literature especially if its specific to the topic. I would probably prefer to hear a DA/Case/CP debate.

Evidence - I feel I have a much higher threshold then most when it comes to reading evidence. If you tell me to read a piece of evidence and dont tell me why or what to look for in it, I probably won't call for it. If you tell me your evidence says one thing and the other team doesnt question it, Ill just take your word for it. Specific evidence comparison in speeches or in cross x is encouraged.

Conduct - Dont be a jerk. You can be effective and be nice.
