I have been judging Lincoln Douglas debate for 2 years. As an academic, I have researched some judging philosophies. Based on what I’ve learned and my interpretation of the unique aspects of Lincoln Douglas debate, the following describes my judging paradigm.
 
Lincoln Douglas debate is a clash of values. The value represents a means to a world “as it should be”. Thus, the debater that upholds their value best will likely win the round. Here are some specific points that I believe are important:
 
Analysis – The debater will clearly present a logical argument and also effectively refute the opponent’s case. 
 
Proof – There should be a sufficient quantity and quality of evidence to support the case. More evidence is not always better. The contentions should also link back to the value.
 
Organization - There should be a logical and orderly presentation throughout the round.
 
Refutation/ Clash – The better debater will demonstrate the ability to critically analyze the opponent’s arguments and develop clear and logical responses with effective use of evidence and examples.
 
Delivery – The speech must be understandable, interesting, and persuasive. An LD debater should demonstrate effective oral communication skills including; effective reading, clear and understandable delivery, persuasive vocal argumentation, presence, and eye contact.
 
A last note: I have observed that LD debaters who try to use speed sacrifice a great deal of understandability and persuasiveness. Typically, the amount of evidence added to the case is not worth that sacrifice. As a result, I dislike excessive speed, as I have difficulty flowing the argument, and it seems as though speed becomes more important than persuasion.
