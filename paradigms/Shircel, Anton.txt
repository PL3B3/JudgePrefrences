Years of Judging: 8 years
What I have judged: Middle School, Novice, Junior Varsity, Varsity Policy Debate, and LD every once in a while.

I shall keep this short. Being longwinded was always something I hated. I am not the biggest fan of topicality. The burden is on the negative to ultimately prove to me that the affirmative is beyond the scope of the topic. My general philosophy is a policymaker. I like to see in the final rebuttals a general world view and then a specific support structure to show why their worldview is best. So, it can be deduced that I enjoy counterplans, disadvantages and some good impact analysis. Kritiks are alright, not my favorite type of argument. If you go for this type of argument you had better have a good grasp of it. I can't stand it when people get confused in their arguments. I will add more soon, but other commitments await.
