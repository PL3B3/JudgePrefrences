  do what you do. Debate has one rule, two teams debate, after that is your job to explain to me what I'm voting for. Absent any discussion of what my ballot is for I guess I default to offense defense/my interpretation of the best debating. My job as the judge is to always listen to and evaluate what you put out there. Do what you want but you gotta win an argument. I'm gunna sound like i debated in the 80s but an argument requires a claim, warrant and impact. You've read that line before but if all three of those aren't a component of your speeches they are not arguments, I'm really speaking to warrants here. Good internal link level analysis matters as much if not more than impact comparison for me. I'm often left with two impacts and no way to resolve it if the debaters have not created a framework for me to evaluate so I default to most logical impact (I think). 
slow down on theory and Counterplan texts. I tell myself im a good flow but we can all be better. Sometimes I am listening the pen isn't going, I promise I'm paying attention. You paid to go yell at two otherkids in a room, I'm gunna give you the same time you gave me.
Above all else have fun and enjoy the game you get to play, it's special and has a profound impact even when you leave. 
stay trill.
