  Debated for Greenhill in LD my sophomore and junior years. Dabbled in Policy thereafter and then went to China where debate was a little less... encouraged. Freshman year I did Public Forum at a local school in Dallas but that's not a phase I like to talk about. Currently a UChicago undergraduate.

I'm genuinely a pretty blank slate given that I was never particularly attached to debate on the national circuit. Just ask me if you have any more specific question.

Speed--I can handle it. Not like, drag racing fast. More like minivan late to soccer fast. I'll be generous with yelling clear.I will say that I am not the biggest fan of super-kritikal arguments (especially non-topical K Affs, which apparently have become all the more of a thing) because my knowledge of critical theory is rusty at best and because I think debating the topic is good, etc. If you are going to run stuff like that, do be prepared to do a little more explaining and talk slow and generally be nice to me.I'm comfortable evaluating both contention- and framework-level debate obviously, but I'm probably going to be a slightly more comfy dealing with the former.So, yeah, LARP away. Plans. Disads. Love it. Don't like, actually, literally LARP though. I'm probably not going to like your performative stuff and will probably scream and it will probably be uncomfortable for everyone."Wow so he's a Greenhill drone who doesn't know what deontology is I guess"bite me yes I do you don't NEED to be LARPyTheory is fun isn't itRVIs drive me insane. I will probably not vote aff on them unless the negative literally doesn't touch it on the flow. And even then, it's up in the air.I default to competing interpretations because it's 2016 and Donald Trump could be President--reasonability has been dead since at least the RNC in July.
