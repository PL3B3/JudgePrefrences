  I come from Miami University (Ohio) and my highschool was Austintown Fitch (Ohio). I debated at Miami for about two years in policy until our program was cut and then made the switch to speech. I competed for four years in highschool, public forum and ld. I went to state all four years and was a national qualifier for 3. I have been judging highschool policy for 4 years and highschool ld, public forum and speech events for three years. 

I am a very open judge. I love to see tricky and well thought out plans rather than just throwing everything you have out there. In more specific terms I would rather see two well developed neg arguments than 8 two page arguments. However if you would like to throw everything out there at me I am fine with that. 

I like to keep my judging simple:
Counterplans: Love them. Especially a good pic. 
Theory: Love it, just dont bore me with lame abuses like 'time'.
T: Love it when done right and commited to it. 
Disads: Love them. 
K's: Are my favorite. I specialized in them when I debated and love to hear them run properly. However, beware that I will know when you do not understand your K, so please do not read them just to make your oppenent have to talk about them. I cannot be fooled by you using the terminology on the K core to make it seem like you know what you are talking about. 
Weird Stuff: I will allow it, however if you are going to perform infront of me, you are taking a risk.
Flow: I will not pull arguements across for you if you do not ask me to. I will not do the work for you, if I have a pet peeve this is it. I will not clean up your flow for you so make sure its nice and tidy. 
Speed: Start slow at first and then you can get faster I just take a minute to get used to your style and then I am normally good. 

I know these more pertian to policy, but for other forms of debate my main judging philosophy is still there, I allow anything. Just make sure its neat and well thought out. 

Overall: Entertain me.
