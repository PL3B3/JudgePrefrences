  Experience: I debated for four years at TASIS The American School in England, mostly LD and some PF, and coached there for two years. This is my second year judging and I will be judging the JV rounds.

How I approach the debate: 

I appreciate a strong, well-constructed argument that doesn’t try to be more complicated than it needs to be. In other words, KISS -- keep it simple, stupid. This is not to say I don’t value complex arguments or frameworks, but I find it distracting when the focus of a debate strays too far away from the core arguments and value structures of each respective side. To this point, when using kritiks, extensions, disads, etc., be super clear and create a framework for me to judge by. Make it easy for me to follow your argument, because if I am confused it is likely that I will not favor your side of the debate. Additionally, do not throw around jargon and buzzwords because they might sound impressive. In terms of structuring your speech, I encourage off-time roadmapping. Make my job easy and lay out your plan of attack so that I can track your arguments and measure them up against the scales you have set. Similarly, impact calculus is also effective with me. Weigh the vital parts of your argument against those of your opponent’s, and explain in your own words why yours is ultimately better. When I say vital I mean important, but I also mean it literally: bring them to life for me. Why do your arguments carry more weight? Make your impact real!

Speed: No spreading, just don’t do it please and thank you!!!! I’m fine with you talking quickly as long as it is not at the expense of content or comprehension. I understand that there is a lot of information to get through in a debate, but ultimately if your argument lacks clarity is difficult to understand, it will be hard for me to give you the win. Speak to me as your judge, not at me. Effective delivery is a component of rhetoric and enhances the content of your speeches.
