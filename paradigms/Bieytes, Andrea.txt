  I debated 1 year of policy and 3 years of Lincoln Douglas debate at John's Creek high school (GA). I graduated in 2012 and now coach LD for John's Creek. I am familiar with the topic lit and most arguments for LD and PF. I am a sophomore at Georgia State and major in spanish education and african american studies. I will usually be judging varsity LD and PF but I like to think that I am also a competent policy judge since the team I work has a large policy team. 

LD/PF 
1. I can follow speed but will call clear if I have to. 
2. I like theory and evaluate it like any other argument on the flow. At the same time, don't make me hate debate. =( 
3. CPs/DAs/Ks are fine just be familiar with the K lit. I come from a policy background so feel comfortable running whatever you want.
4. At local Georgia tournaments that use the outdated NFL speech rubric, I will be giving higher points to try and equal out the scale.
5. I always disclose! 


I enjoy people that have personalities in debate rounds, but don't make a fool of yourself and make both of us feel awkward. Jokes are fine but puns are better.
