  Hi! I'm Emma, and I'm a freshman at Harvard. I debated in LD on the national circuit for three years, but I didn't debate my senior year so I'm not up to date on common args and lit. I debated under La Costa Canyon HS and Leucadia Independent. 

I'm pretty familiar with theory and T, but not very familiar with K lit and dense philosophy, so make sure you slow down and explain any dense or esoteric cards you read. I prefer theory in shell format and default to competing interps. I'll evaluate the round from the top layer (hopefully clearly framed by the debaters, but default: theory, T, framework, offense (k's fit somewhere but depends on the k)). I'll go down the layers evaluating who won offense to the layer above. I haven't been in the debate community in a while, so slow down a bit. I'll yell clear if I can't understand you. 

Have fun!
