  Hi, Iâ€™m Katya! I'm a sophomore in college and I did LD debate in high school with Torrey Pines High School/ Del Mar Independent. 

The last time I judged was at the 2016 UC Berkeley tournament. I have been very out of touch with debate since coming to college. 

I will do my best to fairly evaluate the round, but I honestly have no idea how well I'll be able to handle spreading/ whatever crazy arguments the kids are reading these days. 

Do whatever you want in front of me as long as you are respectful. Please don't contribute to making the debate space more exclusive than it already is!!

Finally, GOOD LUCK and HAVE FUN!!!
