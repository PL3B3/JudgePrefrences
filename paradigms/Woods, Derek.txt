  TOPICALITY - is competing interpretations of the resolution. If your
interruption is better for debate and you will get my vote. I have
some sympathy for resonantly arguments.

THEORY - these debates tend to be way to fast fast, slow down and
explain fully the violation and the impact to the violation. I will
vote on any thing if it has a developed impact and a clear violation.

CRITIQUES - operate an abstract level that doesn't address the
concrete consequences of plan action most of the time . If you want to
win I need to be able to fully explain how the critique either turns
the affirmative impact claims and or makes it impossible to solve. I
am not fluent in the literature if you engage in esoteric philosophic
language or concepts most likely I will be left behind. A intricate
articulation of how the critique operates in simple terms is key to
getting my vote on the K.

PERFORMANCE - arguments should be grounded in a plan text that
represents topical action.

COUNTERPLANS / DA- favorite type of debates do it.
