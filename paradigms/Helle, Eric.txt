  I've been judging at league tournaments and invitationals since 2010, including the Stanford Invitational, Jack Howe, Fullerton, as well as at the CHSSA State Championships. 

My favorite events to judge are Lincoln-Douglas and Public Forum. I like the real world skills these events develop in competitors and I appreciate the educational value each offers debater and judge alike.

As for winning my ballot: I like a good battle between frameworks and will look at how you attack at the contention level as well as at the value-criterion. I will often give a nod to the competitor who is most informed about the issue being debated and can apply that knowledge and understanding to their own framework and against their opponent's.

Other considerations that go into my ballot: deportment, effective speaking, and a smidgen of good ol' pathos.
