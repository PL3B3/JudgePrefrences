  Judging Philosophy for Lincoln Douglas Debate




    
        
Butrimas, Darcy
Coach at Trinity Preparatory School
Specifics:
Theory Arguments are fine with me as long as they make sense, ie: they have a link and an impact.
If you go off case, and you put all of your chances on an off-case argument(s), you have better be sure
that they "stick".

Topicality: Don't do that. I will probably not vote for it.

DisAds: They are fine with me. Just be sure that they are linked well.

Counterplans: Again, okay. They have to be exclusive. I like co-opting CPs.

Kritiks: Again, a risk, but okay if they link. They should be argued clearly as well. If it sounds like
a bunch of garbage that is just used to burn time, I will not grant them much merit.

Framework: Most appreciated. Make it clear and make your arguments feed the framework.

Theory: As I said earlier, I am accepting of theory arguments. But if you put a lot at stake,and then it
doesn't work out, you may be in trouble. I won't award you for a clever twist unless it fits
in with everything else, and you follow through on it.

Speaker Points: I generally give high speaker points for a spirited debate. I DON"T encourage mindless
spreading. If I cannot clearly hear your arguments, I don't vote for them.

Cross-Ex: Don't be abusive. Debate is an educational activity, not an opportunity for verbal abuse.

Overall: I am pretty open-minded and accepting of most arguments and approaches. I just don't like 
unlinked and "canned" arguments without impacts. And I am not a fan of speed.
