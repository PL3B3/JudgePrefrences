Westminster 2015
UGA 2018 (not debating)

I'm a junior at the University of Georgia. I graduated from Westminster with four years of high school debate experience and had a decent amount of success, but I've been out of debate for a few years now, which has greatly changed my perspective on the activity. I haven't judged any rounds on this topic.

Run what you want and do what you're best at. Like everyone, I naturally have opinions about arguments, but as a judge I'm generally pretty good at divorcing my own biases from the round. If you're winning on the flow, you'll probably win the debate. As far as specific biases are concerned, I strongly believe the affirmative should read a topical plan and defend both its material implications and broad underlying assumptions. I dislike judging obscure high theory K's, hyper-generic process CP's that do the entirety of the aff, and affs that don't defend a plan, but I'll still vote for these arguments if you're winning.
