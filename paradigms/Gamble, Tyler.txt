-----Final Edit----- 

1. Put me on the email chain.
2. I don't traditionally flow. I take notes.
3. I try to assume as little as possible and will attempt to vote on arguments in the round. (if you start, complicating things or run complicated debatey positions that rely on preconceived debate notions this may change)
4. I will vote on anything I can understand. 
5. My favorite arguments are weighing, framing, and meta-analysis. Tell me what to do with my ballot and how to evaluate arguments.

Everything below are my previous thoughts on debate.

If you plan on reading anything that isn't crazy or outside the box don't pref me because you will get low speaks and I will evaluate these arguments with extremely low weight.
 
Despite my massive disclaimer above, I'll still vote on anything. I have a terrible flow. I give speaks based on strategy and entertainment value. I am dumb with philosophy and semi-dumb with everything else. If I am laughing no matter the reason, high speaks. Don't be too offensive, but I enjoy jokes of all types. If you bore me, low speaks.

If you win with at least 2 mins of speech time remaining, you will receive at least 29 speaker points.

If you have any other questions about my paradigm, feel free to keep them to yourselves.

I evaluate speaker points based on the amount of bitcoins you send to this address: 15oxr8ZPVobgBodEH5F5wbfsvbTv2SkeJ7

30 -- .01 BTC
29.5 -- .0075 BTC
29 -- .005 BTC
28.5 -- .003 BTC
28 -- .002 BTC

If no donations are received, you will be evaluated on a 28 speaker point scale.
