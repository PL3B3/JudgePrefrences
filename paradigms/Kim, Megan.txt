  I’m a first year out judge from Millard North High.

POLICY:
Arguments:
I did traditional policy affs for a little while and then moved on to more identity-based Ks

I’m not well-versed with high theory type arguments/postmodernism – I just have a hard time understanding the literature and arguments. If you still want to run pomo with me as your judge, I will try my absolute best to understand things, but you’ll kinda be fighting an uphill battle. I’m sorry.

Round Things: (circles)
Open Crossex is completely fine with me – it won’t really affect speaker points unless you are dominating your partner’s cross-ex time

I don’t take prep for flashing but don’t take 5 minutes to flash please just try your best

LINCOLN DOUGLAS:
The majority of my experience is in Policy. I graduated with Grant Brown and Priya Kukreja, so I have watched them debate a number of times over the past few years. 

While I'm still learning the norms of LD, I'm open to essentially whatever you run. Just take the time to explain things, avoid assuming I know what you mean, and I should be good. I'll warn you that I'm not too informed on the tricks of LD, so debaters favoring that style of debate probably want to pref other judges.
