  I debated in college for Idaho State University where I had the opportunity to run a WIDE range of arguments. 

I enjoy all forms of debate as long as a clear framework for evaluation is presented. For me framework is more than just an argument policy teams run against the k. Framework is about you as debaters framing the way I will make my decision at the end of the debate. Will I be voting for the team with the quickest link to extinction? Or the team that deconstructs language or takes a stance against militarism? Is topicality a pre-requisit to fair debate or an argument used to limit more important forms of discussion? These types of questions are for you as debaters to decide. At the end of the debate you need to tell me the criteria to use for choosing a winner, and why you over the other team should win given that criteria. 

I appreciate and reward clarity in arguments. I have not judged many debates on this topic, which means you will need to explain things like specific ground that would be lost on T and why that ground is crucial to the topic. 

These debates are about you, so have fun and do what you love.
