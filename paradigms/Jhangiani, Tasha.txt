IMPORTANT NOTE: Blake is my FIRST tournament on the oceans topic. I don’t know too much about it. Please keep this in mind.
ALSO I'M SORRY FOR POSTING THIS LATE BLAME THE INTERNET

People I think similarly to: Matthew Malia (my high school coach), Greg Zoda, Julia Goldman, Michael Koo– check out their philosophies.

tldr: I’ll quote my coach here: “I believe students should make the forum into what they wish it to be.” Do what you do best, and as long as you make it organized, I’ll listen.

About me: I debated for five years for Edgemont High School on both my local New York circuit as well as the national circuit. I was a 1N/2A for most of high school but I occasionally was a 1A/2N. I’m now a freshman at Case Western Reserve University and am no longer debating, but am sort of serving as a pseudo-assistant coach at Edgemont.

Performance / non-traditional affirmatives.

-I was a non-traditional debater for my senior year and I love judging these debates.
-I especially love feminism / intersectionality debates, and I’m well versed in that literature.
-I don’t think affirmatives need to read a plan; however, this is IMPORTANT: I will vote on framework if it is won. My decision to not read framework pretty much ever in my high school career was simply because of strategy. (Also, our framework file kind of sucked).
-Make sure you define the role of the ballot for me, and don’t make it an arbitrary “impact prioritization” role of the ballot.
-Alternative ways of speaking (ie dancing, spoken word, etc) – this is all fine with me. If you’re using music and / or external clips and you are talking over it, please keep it at a decent enough volume so that I can hear both the clips and you. Your style is your style. I will accept it.

Case debates:
-These debates are FUN and UNDERUTILIZED
-Don’t just read impact defense
-2As tend to undercover case in the 2AC. The 2A should try to avoid this. If the 2A does undercover, the block should exploit this
-Offense is sweet. Impact turn debates are so much fun to judge
-Case Ks are also hella effective, I’ve found that 2As tend to not answer these well and the block can end up having a great time exploiting this

Topicality / other procedurals:
-Fairly ambivalent about competing interpretations vs reasonability, aff needs to properly define reasonability though
-Don’t make the debate inherently shallow – argue why fairness outweighs education / vice versa
-Also don’t make the “you make debate hard cuz you make us do more research” argument.
-ASPEC and OSPEC usually are not things. You can try to make them things, but I probably won’t like it. Unless they’re topic specific cards. That could be interesting. Usually that’s not a thing, though.

Counterplans:
-FOR GOD’S SAKE SLOW DOWN ON COUNTERPLAN TEXTS
-Explain what the counterplan does, especially if it’s topic specific. This is especially important for Blake as I’m still learning what this topic is.
-If you have aff-specific solvency cards, your speaker points will improve.
-In my opinion: functional competition > textual competition
-Theory debates are terrible 99% of the time because people never freaking impact them.
-Agent / process CPs are arguably not competitive but I really can be convinced otherwise.

Disads:
-Not really sure what needs to be explained here; these are fine.
-Politics theory debates are arguably the bane of my existence.
-I think the link controls the direction of uniqueness but again, I can be persuaded
-Keep in mind I’m a history and political science double major. I know quite a bit about the political process and am fascinated by politics. If you botch a politics disad (believe me, I’ve seen it done before), I’ll probably really dislike you.

Ks:
-These are fine. Please don’t read a K just because you have me in the back of the room though; I promise I can be a balanced judge.
-Don’t just spew out random jargon and expect it to make sense.
-Fairly familiar with security lit, cap lit, fem lit (I’m a gender studies minor), some race lit, etc.
-Specificty is SO IMPORTANT. Pull out examples from aff evidence – this will increase your speaker points. Or have some form of aff-specific evidence.
-Do the work on the line by line
-History can help you quite a lot in these debates. I’m a history and political science double major – see above. Get your historical events right. Again, if you botch this, I’ll know it, and I won’t like it.

Theory:
-Conditionality – more than three conditional options is kind of pushing it, but I can be convinced otherwise as long as you debate it well
-I think PICS are sweet
-International fiat is probably okay especially if you have evidence in the context of the aff
-Call out floating PIKS, I think these are cheating
-Yeah tbh I tend to err neg on theory but again, I can be convinced otherwise

Miscellaneous stuff:

-I don’t take prep for flashing as long as you’re not silly about it. In other words, be efficient
-If you plan on using an email chain, please include me in it – I won’t look at the speech docs till after the round, however (if I need to)
-If you make jokes about my friends, that may increase your speaker points slightly (not by more than 0.2 or so). Stalk my Facebook, if you must.
-Communication, creativity, and clash are all key to any excellent debate.
-A non-threatening atmosphere is a necessary prerequisite to any debate
-MARK YOUR SPEECH DOCS – EITHER THE PERSON GIVING THE SPEECH SHOULD DO IT OR THEIR PARTNER SHOULD DO IT. A good friend of mine lost a bid round last year because of an issue that arose due to marking. Seriously, this is IMPORTANT.
-Don’t call me judge – I do have a name.
-Clarity is hella important – definitely more important than speed.
-Misrepresenting evidence (ie clipping, cross reading, evidence fabrication) in any way is unacceptable and will result in a loss and zero speaker points. I am praying I don’t have to deal with any of this
-Also, this is completely random – my partner and I successfully delivered the no-card block strategy five times senior year and won every single time. Try this at your own risk. If you’re successful, I’ll be incredibly impressed, and it’ll show in your speaker points.

Gosh this is a complete mess, sorry for the disorganization
