  I did four years of policy debate at Lynbrook HS from 2012-2016. I'm currently a high school senior and have both debated and on the transportation, latin american, oceans, and surveillance topics. I was a 1a / 2n if that makes a difference to anyone.

I'm open to any argument you want to make (provided that it's not offensive) and I'll try my best to evaluate it fairly. I'm more policy-oriented but ran kritiks throughout high school. If you do run a nuanced critical position, please explain it thoroughly and impact it well. 

General things: please slow down on tags/theory and impact calculus. If you have any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them before the round.
