  This is my fourth year judging Lincoln Douglas and PF debate, I have judged at Princeton, Harvard, District and States in the past. I am familiar with how debate works and comfortable with either LD or PF debate. I have been a psychologist for 16 years and am very interested in politics and will have no problem understanding any arguments/contentions. Politically, I am socially liberal, more libertarian and conservative for most other issues. 

I prefer if the competitors speak at a reasonable speed while giving their speeches but, I do understand that speed is an important aspect to any debates. I do not like spreading ( please do not use this strategy) and will provide you with warnings to slow down if you are speaking to rapidly.

As a judge I will pay close attention to rebuttals, cross fires and cross examinations in order to decide the winner. These are the areas where I will look for the competitors to convince me of their arguments and clash. In general, I will reward clearly researched, well thought-out and insightful arguments, feel free to run unique, unconventional contentions as well. I focus on quality over quantity, especially during moments where each position clashes, the most important moments to me. I have not judged any topics this year and have a complete blank slate and fresh and open mind in regards to this topic.
