I debated for Trinity for 4 years and have been coaching/judging for them for 2 years. 
Topicality: It is a voting issue for me. In order for a team to win this argument though, they will have to invest more than 15 seconds on it in the block and must have a good reason for going for anything but topicality in the 2nr. 
Theory args: I don't like blippy theory arguments. I don't think they do anything for you as a team. A-spec is rarely a compelling argument and more likely a waste of paper. If you want to run a theory argument, make sure it is well developed - tagline debating doesn't help me understand why PICs are good or bad. 
I am basically a policymaker, so I love to hear DAs and CPs. 
I am not a big fan of kritiks. I understand that they are part of everyone's strategy now, but that doesn't mean that they are run well. I am not well versed in this area of literature, and there is a tough battle uphill for me to understand a lot of the philosophy. I am not going to read long kritik cards at the end of the round because you were unable to explain the warrants and the implications of your evidence. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
