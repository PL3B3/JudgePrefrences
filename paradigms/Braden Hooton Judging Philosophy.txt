  Braden Hooton's Judging Philosophy:

A quick guide to this page. I will be all over the place, but I will try my best to inform you where I am going with my point.

Background: I competed 3 years in LD throughout high school. Currently I am competing in Parli for the University of Utah. 
-Speed: I can flow speed and will not be bothered by spewing. Just be sure you are clear and articulating your arguments. As long as I can process what words you are saying, go as fast as you want. 
-Critiques: You can run K's in front of me. Be sure to explain your critique to both me and your opponent because we may not be as well read as you. As long as you explain the K efficiently, which most are, you are welcome to run Ks.
-Theory: I love structured theory arguments. If you establish concrete structure and tell me why theory matters, I tend to vote on theory. 
-Speaker Points: I do pay attention to the debater and their fluidity of their speech, but debaters who sign post and have structure tend to have higher speaker points with me holding the ballot.
-Voters: Use impact calculus to tell me why your arguments matter. Without terminalized impacts, I have nothing to vote on. This is huge for me personally as a judge. 
-CP&DA: I love good CP and Disads. Do not always assume there is a link to the DA, because that is simply not the case. Do the work and show me how the Aff links to your DA.
Performance K's: Not a huge fan. You are welcome to run them in front of me, but be careful as I do not enjoy most performance cases. 

Most important thing to me is having fun, as clique as that sounds. Debate is suppose to be an enjoyable event, so have fun with tournaments and be kind towards your opponents. I am cool with being aggressive in rounds, but do not make a miserable time for all of us.
