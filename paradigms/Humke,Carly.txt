  I live in Vermont with my two teenage boys and husband and am looking forward to this opportunity to judge. I am interested in how young people are using critical thinking skills to articulate global issues. In this day and age it's more important than ever to be able to analyze information and show skills of evidence-based reasoning. Please be organized, clear, and succinct and I will be able to understand your arguments and points. I will look for and listen to convincing language, persuasive facts and intelligent responses to your opponent. Aggression will not win favor but convincing me why your side is stronger in a clear manner will.
