  I am a traditional LD Judge. I am okay with speed, but I by no means encourage it. I place equal weight on presentation and argumentation. I like to see rigerous logic and an understandable and eloquent speaking style. I also ask that during the debate round you focus on the philosophy behind the arguments you are making rather than just on the argument itself.
