Greetings, for those of you debating at Harvard 2013, this will be my third tournament I've ever judged at. If you have me as your judge, I highly recommend that you speak at a conversational speed; signpost and most importantly you give voting issues. I'm looking for a very traditional LD round so please make that happen. Please don't run any odd arguments, nor should you attempt to run a plan, DA, etc.

Best of luck to you!
