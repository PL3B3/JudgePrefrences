Currently Coach Beacon High School. Debated at Bronx Science 1980-84. Graduate Georgetown U, NYU Law. Judged a lot in 80s. No contact with debate till last year when as teacher at Beacon started working with debate team.

I have become comfortable with Kritiks and other recent developments in high school debate through the students I coach. Bottom line is that I am largely a tabula rasa --you can argue anything but you need to tell me why I should vote for you. If you do not weigh things in the final rebuttals and leave it up to me to do all the work, I will not be happy. So if you are arguing things that are non-traditional policy, or coming up with innovative theoretical arguments about the activity, you need to argue and win the framework debate.
