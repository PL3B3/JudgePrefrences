  I'm the parent of a former LD competitor, former CPA and public speaker myself. I have been judging LD for three years, and have judged more than 65 rounds of novice and varsity rounds up to and including semis and finals. The important thing to me is organization: Make sure you state your value and criterion clearly and which points you are attacking. I don't generally flow cross-ex, but if you haven't been listening to your opponent, I'll notice it in your questions to him or her. Just make your arguments understandable to the normal person--meaning, if you start debating theory, you'll probably lose me. A fast conversational speed is okay but no "spreading". Overall, I'd rather hear a debater who sounds passionate about the subject (hard to do, I know, with some of the LD resolutions), than a cold-hearted whiz spouting off other people's ideas, any day.
