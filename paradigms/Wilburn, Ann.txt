I prefer traditional LD (in regards to Value and Criterion-that being said, I don’t want to be bored with stock cases). I am not opposed to the other types of argumentation. If the argument is solid and well thought out, be it traditional or progressive, I will vote on that. If the argument is not well supported, I will vote on that, not necessarily the avenue of which you took. Like most judges, I enjoy unique thinking and a well executed debate. If you run a theory or kritik, please be clear and concise. 
 
This is not a race, so please watch your speed. You don’t have to go Grandma slow but I like to flow every argument which is not possible if you are the Dale Earnhardt Jr. of the LD world. 
 
I enjoy CX and clash of ideals however I want to know the implications of said arguments. Reading blocks and cards does no use if you can’t explain the clash between the two. 
 
Be mindful of your attitude and the way in which you present yourself. I will deduct speaker points for any rude or offensive behavior. We are all here for the learning experience so let us all make that an enjoyable one. 
 
Persuasion is a factor for me. Wit is always appreciated as well as intelligence.
