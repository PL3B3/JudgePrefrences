  Hi, My name is Annalisa,
I debated for 3 years in high school mostly in Student Congress but I have limited experience in LD and PF as well.
As a relatively inexperienced judge, I am open to all forms of debate and types of arguments. Value debates are your best bet with me but I am entirely willing to listen to anything you put forth.

Even so, I do pay close attention to how each point is refuted. I can deal with speed though I do not believe it is necessary for a good debate and that slower speeches are easier to judge. As for speaker points, cordiality, succinctness, and being able to present the argument in an interesting and clear way is most important.

Overall, Have fun, be clear, play nice and good luck!
