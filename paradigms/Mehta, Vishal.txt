I was a national qualifier in Congressional Debate, and I prefer the stylistic elements of Congress, like clear and slow delivery.

I base my decisions on the standards debate. Each debater should give clear voting issues that link arguments they are winning to the relevant standard.  [[Doshi, Priyank#|help on how to format text]]
