  Judge’s Philosophy
James Baker
Affiliation: BUDL (Baltimore Polytechnic Institute)
Judging experience: 2 years

I am a seven-year Social Sciences teacher. I have degrees in History and Secondary Education. First an foremost I am a policy person, I know policy and understand the process and impacts of policy. Having said that, I am not averse to critical debate. I am always interested in new K’s and their arguments. I am familiar with philosophy and modern social issues and debates. I abhor speed-reading. I allow it, but speeding at the point of unintelligibility is a pointless exercise in my mind.
