  Galdemez, Chris
I was a TOC and State (CA) competitor in Congress when I debated with the Mountain View-Los Altos High School team.

Speed: If I can’t understand you, I can’t vote for you.   It is the your responsibility to be clear, audible, and comprehensible, as well as to speak with some degree of eloquence.  I do not like spreading.

 I have a relatively traditional paradigm and I am not a big fan of Kritiks or theoretical abuses. Please keep your jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy. Speaker points do not reflect quality of argumentation except for extremely offensive positions. As always, I do not wish to give you a free check to make bad arguments – my displeasure is simply expressed in the ballot in most rounds.

Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
