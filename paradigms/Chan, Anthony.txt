  I have several years judging experience on the national and local circuit, though I much prefer persuasive debate over technical debate. I like to see cases that have clear, persuasive, logical argumentation that is linked to a standard that I can use to evaluate whose world I'd rather live in -- affs or negs. I tend to favor pragmatic arguments over philosophy, and I want to see evidence that has strong warrants in it. Debate is a communications activity, and I don't like speed as it diminishes the educational value of the activity. Signposts and crystallization are key, and impacting and weighing in rebuttals is essential. Treat me like a traditional judge with an emphasis on clear communication.
