  I am a parent judge, I have been judging since 2006. I have judged almost every speech and debate event, with two children competing who have both qualified for Nationals.

I like a clear argument. I flow as much as possible and like to see each side address the other side's arguments. You should have evidence to back up your case, but the case does not need to be driven by it if your case is logical or self-evident.

My decision rests on your value, criterion and contentions in the round. Convince me why you case is better than your opponent's. I do like a road map if you jump around, it helps me flow, and that will help you if I know you hit all your points.

I am from New York, so speed to some judges is just casual conversation to me, however, this is LD, not policy, so speed by itself will not win a round. If I can't flow it, I will say 'clear', if I have to repeat it I will put my pen down. I would rather have fewer reasoned arguments than more contentions that have no backup. Remember, you are selling me your case, not trying to overwhelm me with words.

I like at least some eye contact. During first constructive, I know you are reading your speech, but eye contact while speaking makes me feel you really know your topic, especially during rebuttal.

Be professional, look good, neat and well groomed. Don't be rude to your opponent, it will cost you speaker points. Be confident and assertive, but that doesn't mean rolling your eyes or interrupting constantly. I love a good debate (again, from NY) but be professional.
