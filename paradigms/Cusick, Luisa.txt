My beliefs - 

Since (mostly) leaving debate I've found that I have fewer ideological preferences than before and am not invested in what you argue. There are some arguments that I think are more truthful than others, but there is very little that I would not vote for, and there is even less that I think is (capital T) Truth. 

The best strategies are determined by the lit base – what constitutes a good counterplan, disad, critique, or T argument is dependent on the evidence quality. That includes many counterplan competition questions. Solvency advocates are important, and they can persuade me that questionably competitive positions are good. 

I will only read cards that come into question in the debate. I value research at least as much as one's ability to defend something, but that doesn't mean you get credit for unexplained warrants.

My ballot does not have the power to increase accessibility, align myself with a certain movement, or change anything other than who wins.

Zero risk exists and try or die is dumb.
