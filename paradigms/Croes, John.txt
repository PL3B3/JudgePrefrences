  I am a relatively new volunteer, although I debated in high school and college in the 1960's. Debate has changed significantly since then, and I'm not comfortable with spreading and the abbreviated language. Make the round slower than you would normally debate and really clear. I am more comfortable with novice level and not with K's; I'm not ready for varsity level . I want to see persuasion, eye contact, respectful clashing of ideas/ evidence. The final two rebuttals are very important to me.
