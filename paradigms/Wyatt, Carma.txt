  I’m an inexperienced judge; there is no getting around it. I have only judged a small number of debate tournaments before, because of this I have a hard time with some things like speed. I would advise not using it if I’m judging your round. To win my rounds, paint a good picture of why I should vote for you and not the other debater.
