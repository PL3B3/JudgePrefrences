I would like to witness a debate where a team explains the role of the ballot and what the world will look like after the plan for this reason alone I believe that topicality is an all or do not even bother issue. I prefer policy debates with creative and quality arguments. If you are going to read a “big word” argument, that should not be mashed into a nine minute speech, I would prefer you pass on me as I tend to not understand them and would rather that you not insult someone's life work by trying this. However, I will listen to a K and general prefer them if they are centered on movements or you do a good job of explaining how the Aff. makes the world worse than the SQ (notice these are policy calculations). ALWAYS take the extra time to explain your arguments just because the other team "drops" an argument doesn't mean you win. Rather it should be explained and impacted to win the debate.
Other things you should know… I tend to not flow but rather take notes and focus on the big picture. If I cannot understand you, I will say “clear” once! If your reading does not change I will let you read till doomsday but cannot promise that I understood any of it. It is your responsibility to be clear and precise. I am quick to keep the timer going, when a speech or cross-x is done I expect you to be ready to get up and go or tell me you need prep time otherwise I will start the timer as soon as I can. I also do not read evidence after the debate (it is your job to explain/call out the other team’s evidence). I usually call for evidence only for source sites.
Debate is a fun activity, so please be remember I am your audience entertain me! If you do not like the way I chose to vote, live with it I will not change my mind with a debate after the debate.
