  Note: You need to be a Member in order to enter your name and Judge Philosophy. Just click the link above to "Join" the site, and send a message to request membership; we'll approve you, and then you can add your Philosophy. We had to add this step because the site was being vandalized.

Then: Post your name {Last name, First name} on the indicated page, according to the letter starting your last name. Please enter your name where it belongs in the list alphabetically; thus, if your last name is Gomez, put it after Gaster, but before Gonzo. Then surround your name by double square brackets and hitsave. Example: [ [Glass, David] ] (except don't leave a space between the brackets as is done here... just type the two brackets consecutively). After you [[#|enter]] name in square brackets, then click "save".

After saving, then click on your name to access your page. Click the edit button, enter the desired text, and click save again.

So your name would appear like:
Glass, David
and then you press "save" your name will be linkable when you click, it will send you to your name page; once you're there, erase the welcome text on that page, and paste in your philosophy then press save. If you need any further help, please email me at: gacggc@gmail.com

IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, PLEASE DON'T EDIT THIS PAGE. IF YOU MESS IT UP, NO ONE CAN USE THE WIKI UNTIL YOUR REVISION HAS BEEN ROLLED BACK.

DO NOT ADD YOUR PHILOSOPHY IN THE DISCUSSION SECTION BELOW; IT WILL BE DELETED.
