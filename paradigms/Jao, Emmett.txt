  I'll keep this short and sweet, but feel free to ask me any questions about my preferences when you come into the room.

1) I can flow reasonably fast cases, but you will need to slow down for taglines, signpost clearly, and enunciate well. If I can't understand you, I won't flow you very well.

2) I care a lot about framework, generally preferring V/VC ones, but am open to others. Regardless of what framework you use, impact back to it, justify it (especially if you don't use a V/VC one), and just make sure it is present throughout the round.

3) Theory - I have a high threshold for it. Please do not use it as a time suck - only use it if there is clear abuse.
