  Here are the criteria I use to judge the round.

1. Burden of proof: Which debater has proven his/her side of the resolution more valid as a general principle? I don't focus too much on insignificant dropped arguments.

2. Value Structure: Which debater better established a clear relationship between the argumentation and the value structure?
If the value is same for both sides, which case ultimately came across as the most just?If the values are different, which value applies better to the resolution after listening to the arguments? Which debater convinced me that he/she best supports his/her value?
3. Argumentation: Which debater better presented his/her arguments with logical reasoning using appropriate support?

4. Clash: Which debater best showed the ability to both attack his/her opponent's case and to defend his/her own?
