  I competed in LD debate for two years at Ankeny High School in IA and for two years at Cypress Woods High School in TX. This is going to be pretty brief, so feel free to ask me questions before the round. 

Speed: I'm fine with speed as long as you're clear. I'll yell clear once before docking speaks. It would be to your advantage to speak louder than usual and to slow down for analytical arguments, tags, plan/cp/alt texts, etc.

Framework debate: I love framework debates. I'm much more familiar with analytic philosophy than continental philosophy, but I enjoy both. 

Plans, CPs, DAs, Ks, etc: All are fine. Make sure to weigh impacts and explain your arguments well (especially if you're running a K). I won't vote on something I didn't understand the first time it was read. 

Theory/T: I encourage you to use these arguments when there's actual abuse, but I hate frivolous theory/T arguments as well as theory spikes. I think theory should be a RVI, especially for the aff.

Miscellaneous: 
I will trash your speaks for: Miscut evidence, tricks, offensive arguments, being rude to your opponent, lying, etc.I don't care if you sit or standI'm fine with flex prep as long as you ask only clarification questions during prep
