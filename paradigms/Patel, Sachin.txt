  I debated for four years at Troy High School in Fullerton, California, primarily in Student Congress (4 years) and 1 year LD on the local circuit. That said, I am a member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society and have been thoroughly trained in judging LD debates.

I would prefer that the debate is more positional, rather than being purely a discussion about semantics; nevertheless this is purely a question of personal taste, and this is not to say that I will not vote off such an approach.

With regards to critical argumentation, I am moderately fluent with most critical philosophers though should the subject matter be especially dense, a clear synopsis would be preferred.

As for speed, I prefer a moderate pace: again, when the subject matter becomes rather convoluted, particular emphasis of major points would be preferred.

If you have any other specific questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
