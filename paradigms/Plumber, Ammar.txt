Debated for 5 years thus far.
The arguments I've gone for most are Politics DA, Terror DA, Framework, Security K

I'm fine with the K but am not familiar with high theory kritiks like Baudrillard, so, if you plan on going for one, strike me.

Read a plan in front of me, or lose to framework. Or, better yet, strike me.

I will not vote for an argument that I don't understand or doesn't make intuitive sense to me. For example, if you say "words don't mean anything" if you're aff to beat framework, I will not vote on that argument even if it is dropped because of how nonsensical it is.

Clarity is king--applies to text of evidence as well as tags.
