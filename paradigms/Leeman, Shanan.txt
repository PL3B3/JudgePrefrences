I don't take time for flashing.

Case - I prefer plantexts and ks. If reading a k aff, just make sure to explain things clearly

Da - DAS ROCK

T - I tend to lean towards reasonability.But of course, if it's untopical, it's untopical ;)

K - I'm fine with Ks as long as their clearly explained. I'm very familiar with the cap k and security.

CP - I don't like cheatin CP's and will vote for CP theory

Theory - Theory is cool.

I'm pretty chill with anything. If you have any questions, just ask before round

PS - Be funny and entertaining and make jokes about Amar Adam and Jay Khanna

I love Chelsea Thorpe
