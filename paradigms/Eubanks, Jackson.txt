  So, I'll keep this short and sweet. 

I debated 3 years for Lake City High School. I'm alright with pretty much every argument as long as its articulated well. For example, clear explanation of alternative solvency on K's, good line by lines on Theory and T, satisfactory impact calculus between the Neg and Aff, etc... I will vote based off of the flow, so it is crucial that each side frames the debate in the way they wish it evaluated so I know the importance of the arguments. Neither side wants too much judge intervention, I'm sure. That being said, I assume its safe to say I'm a Tabula Rasa judge. Be courteous, intelligent, and diligent in your debates.
