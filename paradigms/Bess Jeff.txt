Third year debating at Missouri State UniversityUpdated 11/4/12

General:- I will always vote for the team that I believe has won the debate based on the arguments presented in the speeches- I want to vote for debaters that are hardworking, strategic, thoughtful and funny- this will be reflected in speaker points- Fortune favors the bold

Topicality:- Reasonability means the aff's counterinterp makes for a sustainable topic/solves for most of the neg's offense- The neg must win a clear violation and substantial offense that proves their interp sets the best limit on the resolution- I have a soft spot for T as a strategic option- I will not protect your "high speed rail aff" just because it "feels" topical if you are truly getting worked on T

Counterplans:- I will not assume that I can kick the cp for you after the debate unless the 2NR makes this explicit- the 2AR gets a response- Theory arguments and permutations "should" be able to defeat "all of the plan" counterplans- reality betrays the sadly aspirational nature of this statement- Conditionality is good but I can respect the necessity of conditionality bad as a last resort for a desperate affirmative team or in particularly egregious cases- I cannot imagine an instance where perm theory is a reason to reject the team

Critiques:- Neg K teams win by (1) beating "case outweighs," (2) solving the case/making it irrelevant, (3) other tricks- Aff teams against the K win by (1) winning the case/outweighing the K, (2) attacking alt solvency, (3) not missing the tricks

Critical affs:- I am amenable to negative topicality arguments against critical affs- For "framework" to be persuasive it should function as a topicality argument- the Boggs DA is distinct- Critical affs that do not defend the resolution can be strategic but should be prepared to engage framework as a topicality argument and should have offense that applies to the negative's T interpretation

Disadvantages/Advantages:- "Uniqueness first" and inane impact distinctions have become too central to modern debate- that being said:- Controlling the frame for how I evaluate the components of the advantage/disad is important and will be rewarded- If there is no link there is no link- "Try or die" (if it is actually try or die) is very persuasive

Other:- I am skeptical of the "low point win"- this is because of what I think speaker points are meant to signify and not how I will evaluate the winner of the debate- I will read evidence after the debate but I will make a conscious effort to reward teams that control spin and not to let your evidence do the debating for you
