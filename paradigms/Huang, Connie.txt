  Parent judge. Do NOT spread. I have judged LD for four years, but do not expect me to understand complex philosophical arguments. Make everything VERY clear. Tell me exactly what to write on the ballot and do lots of weighing. Tell me what is important or else I will judge based on presentation. Empirical evidence is good, but don't spend all of your time dumping cards on your opponent.

Do NOT run K's, plans, disads, theory, etc.

I believe that the best debates are ones that are clear and concise. Speak clearly, be courteous, look confident, and have fun!
