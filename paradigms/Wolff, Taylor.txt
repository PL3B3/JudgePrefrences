  I've been a debater at Western Connecticut State University for 2 years now. Please speak clear and not too fast. I’d prefer to hear one well-thought and explained argument than many poorly constructed blurbs. Overall, I will basically vote on any argument that is not discriminatory (ie don’t say racism good or patriarchy good), so it doesn’t matter if you enjoy CPs, Kritiks, Topicality, Disadvantages, etc. I personally enjoy theory, so don’t drop any voting issues. Make sure you tell me why your permutations are legitimate and desirable. Don’t be a mean debater.
