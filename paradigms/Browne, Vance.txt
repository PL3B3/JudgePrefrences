  I am a lay judge. I have am not comfortable with spreading. I will then ask you to slow down.
My philosophy is that debate should rest with the strength, evidence and cohesion of the arguments presented, irregardless of my personal opinion.
I embrace the concept of 'tabula rasa' as the appropriate paradigm for a judge. Thus, in that context, my job is to assess the merit of one debater over another, based solely on the arguments and evidence presented by each. My goal for feedback is for each debater to learn why they prevailed, or conversely, did not prevail in their round.
I prefer a traditional style Lincoln-Douglas debate, and am uncomfortable with advanced techniques such as theory, plans, counter plans, or Ks.
