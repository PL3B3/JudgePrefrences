  I consider myself to be a tabula rasa judge. If you explain your arguments clearly, I find it hard to think of an argument that I will not vote for. I tend to evaluate the round in the context of an offense/defense paradigm, so keep that in mind when you are impacting your arguments.

I am comfortable with most critical arguments and ran them often during my three years of debating in high school. That being said, I am not extremely versed in critical theory, so if you like going for these arguments, please try to explain them in the context of the debate round in a concise manner. Clarity and impacting is crucial
