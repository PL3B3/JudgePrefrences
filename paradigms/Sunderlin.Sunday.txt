  I am a LD debater at heart, which translates into loving morals, logic, and ethics. Ethics is the biggest one, and I am not afraid to base a round purely on how the competitors I judge interact with both their competition and myself. In less pretty words: Being mean ensures your instant demise.
Love for the metaphysical aside I do enjoy listening to evidence when it serves a valid purpose. Evidence brings context to an argument, makes the issue more tangible. It's a valuable tool, but it can be easily abused. This makes me look for the intelligent use of evidence rather than the "spray and pray" approach. 
And for the love of all the deities, make the round fun. Memorible is a bit much to ask for I think, but fun...fun is doable. If I have to compently listen to the same topic be hashed out several times in a day then I darn well better be able to crack a smile (and dare I hope laugh) sometime during it.
