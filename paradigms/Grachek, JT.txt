The debate must be resolutional. 

No role of the ballot. My job is to choose whoever debated the best.

You need to adjust to your judges, not the other way around. Don't speed or spread. Slightly faster than conversational is fine. If I say clear and you adjust, but I still can't understand you, I will say it again. If I say clear and you ignore me, I will likely miss key warrants.

No theory debate except in response to abuse.

PF:

No speed. I judge based on impacts, not number of arguments that pull through.
