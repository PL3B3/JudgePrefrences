  I debated at Grapevine High School for 4 years in LD debate. I am more of a traditional debater, though I am willing to listen to anything.

One thing I do insist on is a way to weigh the round. I don't care whether it is a criterion, a burden or whatever you can come up with. Just make sure to explain it clearly, why I should use it and how it links to the value, resolution or another structure. I'm a big fan of links, especially when it comes to evidence and a standard.

I like to have things presented to me in a way that makes it easy for me to reach a decision. I understand that this happens rarely, but I do expect being told what the most important arguments are in the round.

I'm open to whatever kind of case you want to run, as long as I am told how to evaluate in the round. Speed is okay, but build up to it.

Anything blatantly offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate will result in a docking of speaker points.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will disclose at the end of the round unless instructed not to by the tournament.

I'm making this clear: DO NOT RUN THEORY OR TOPICALITY SHELLS IN FRONT OF ME UNLESS THERE IS A BLATANT VIOLATION. IF YOUR OPPONENT EVEN PUTS ONE ANSWER ON IT, I'M GOING TO IGNORE IT.
