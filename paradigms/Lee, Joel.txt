  Name: Joel Lee
Debate Experience: 4 years high school policy debate 
Judging Experience: Have judged the Stanford and Berkeley tournaments in years past, but am not involved in debate on a normal basis. Speed is fine but please be clear with your tags. 

Run what you run best. I'm open to most arguments as long as you understand what you're arguing. Not the biggest fan of Topicality but will vote on it if the argument is cohesive. I am more flow-oriented, so dropped arguments almost always comes first. Explaining the implications of an argument wins rounds. I won't do any of the work for you. You need to establish to me why your claims and evidence are better than your opponent's. Analyze your argument and break down the key components.
