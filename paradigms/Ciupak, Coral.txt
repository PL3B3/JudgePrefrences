  I am a former LD competitor who has competed in several state championships, a national championship, and four national circuit tournaments very successfully. I prefer a traditional style, both in argumentation and presentation. If you spread, I can follow you, but beware that rate of delivery can impede effective argumentation. Both debaters are expected to move the discussion forward. We should not be in the same place at the end of the round that we were in the beginning. Evidence that is clearly linked to the arguments is expected, but be sure to provide the link. Simply bombarding me and your opponent with cards leaves little room for warrants and impact claims. The value structure is paramount and will be expected to be upheld on both sides. Do not be abusive to the resolution or to each other.
