  Okay, some background: I was an LDer at local and regional tournaments for two years.

Now for my paradigm:

-Be clear - speed is not a problem as long as you are coherent and organized.

-I want voters. Roadmap, too, please.

-Do NOT present new arguments in your rebuttals and then pretend you didn't.

-I am open to all kinds of styles of arguments. Again, please just try to be coherent.

-Be polite. I absolutely despise rude and condescending debaters.
