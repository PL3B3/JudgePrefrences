Overview
 I'm a pretty vanilla judge. I don't judge on a regular basis so don't depend on a thorough knowledge of the topic and current literature.

Experience
 I debated 4 years of policy in high school. I've judged 4 years, mostly policy and a bit of LD. I've read some Marx but otherwise haven't delved too deeply into philosophy. I'm studying computer science in school.

Rounds judged 2013-2014 season: 10
Rounds judged 2014-2015 season: 8
Rounds judged 2015-2016 season: 5
Rounds judged 2016-2017 season: 5 (LD)

Arguments
 Try to keep the flow organized.Theory – I don't mind voting on this as long as it's warranted and impacted well.No hate speech, eg gender impact turns.Style
 Speed – Make sure tags and cites are clear.Prep time – Don't steal prep.Flashing/Emailing – Email is preferred. Cloud stuff works too as long as I don't need an account.Tag team – Try not to take over and don't be a dick.
LD
 Same as above for LD non specific stuff. LD specific stuff:
You don't need to do the boilerplate stuff if you don't want to (preemptive definitions, value/criterion stuff)Don't be afraid to run theoryIf you both have the same framework don't be afraid to concede and spend time on other stuffTraditional: make sure to impact to either your or your opponent's framework
