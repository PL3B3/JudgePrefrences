I debated policy and LD in high school and parliamentary style (APDA) in college. I'm essentially a tab judge, I'm less bound to specific likes and don't-likes in terms of different types of argumentation as I am to the quality of arguments. I look for warrants, impacts, and weighing. I'm fine with speed, I will call for you to clear if I need it.
