  Background:
Four years of LD at Mission San Jose High School, now an undergrad at UC Berkeley.

Philosophy:
V/VC is huge for me, so big points for arguments that seem relatively cohesive, with contentions directly revolving around V/VC.
I flow, and dropped arguments/contentions are a huge no-no for me, so make sure you keep track of your own arguments as well as those of the opposition.
Kritiks/Critiques are fine as long as they make both logical and rational sense, meaning they would have to be not only logically solid, but also practically plausible. Be very careful.
Although I flow, please don't spread. I reserve the right to give you warnings when I think you are going to fast, or going at a speed unfair to your opposition.
Speaker points are taken seriously; I grade on the full scale. Despite this, don't stress about it too much; speak with reasonable loudness and clarity and you'll do fine. Polite manners when interacting with me and the opposition count towards speaks as well.

98% of the time I will disclose at the end of the round. Lucky you.

The Bottom Line:
Despite all of the above, please don't treat me as a full-on flow judge; I have been out of debate for a few years and so my flow speed and esoteric LD expertise may not match up to what you might prefer. Play it safe, play it fair.

Feel free to ask me any questions before or after the round!
