  background info: i did LD for four years in high school (graduated in 2013).

i consider myself to be a tabula rasa judge. i like the round to be made as easy as possible to judge and so make sure to weigh your arguments against your opponent. impacting back to a standard is generally how i like to see weighing done. but if there is no standard in the round make sure you articulate whats going on. 

i understand K's/cp's/plans and am comfortable judging them. i think its okay to run theory, but it's where i was weakest as a debater. as such, i would just make sure to articulate all theory arguments with care. 

if you are going too fast for me i will say clear, but generally i am ok with speed.

if you have any specific questions feel free to ask before the round.
