  
I am a policy/stock judge.
Tell me where you are going on the flow. Don't leave it up to me to read your mind.
I want to have as little interference in the round as possible. You debate the round, but here are some preset mindsets you might want to be aware of.
DAs -
Love them. Generics ok with good link articulation and a good story.

CPs -
Love them. Don't really like utopian CPs (i.e. anarchy, free market, etc) but the debate is ultimately in the hands of the debaters.

T -
Fine with T. Must have abuse story

Ks -
Not very read on most of the literature. Must be clearly applicable and within bounds of resolutional debate.

Conditionality -
I don't particularly enjoy this if there are massively contradictory worlds. 2-3 worlds is ok if legit. I just want to hear an educational debate.

Inherency -
This is the reason I am stock. I WILL vote on inherency.

Theory -
Depends on the argument. Anything you can convince me of, I will vote.

Speed -
No gasping for breath. I will be fine as long as it's clear, but in the last rebuttals you will be much more persuasive if you slow down.


LD

I want to hear a good value/criterion debate. They ARE necessary to win. Contentions need to directly support value/criterion. I like pragmatic as well as philosophical arguments.

Ks -
Not big on them. As long as its not too crazy i'm ok with it.

CPs -
As long as there is not an advocation with an actual plan, but i'm ok with advocating alternate theories or philosophies. I've never really heard a true CP in LD.
