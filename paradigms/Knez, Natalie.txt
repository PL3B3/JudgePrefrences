I'm a big fan of well researched strategies and specific case debating
(who isn't?). Great cards are important, but your execution is more
important. You should debate well, go for strategic arguments and be
nice to each other. My goal will always be to judge debates based on
what you say and the cards you read, as opposed to my predispositions.
I will say that I haven't judged the high school topic much at all so
explanatory cross ex moments and a clear explanation of your generic
strategies could help you out.
