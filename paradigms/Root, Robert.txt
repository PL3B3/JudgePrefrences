  I am primarily a speech and LD coach, but I also field several CX teams.

Philosophically, I am open to most arguments although I tend to prefer policy arguments and T over the K.
I would not go for theory based arguments unless there is a clear abuse established in the round and it is well explained.
I can handle speed, but the reader must be clear.
