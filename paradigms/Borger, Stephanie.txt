I attempt to be as tabula rasa and flow-oriented as I can; however, I am only human. Your job is to make rendering a non-interventionist decision require as little effort from me as possible. There should be as much genuine clash as possible, and you should weigh your arguments clearly and compellingly. And don't forget that, just like everything else, your weighing claims need to be backed up with warrants.

I am open to any type/style of argument you want to make (assuming it's actually a well-developed warranted argument, not just a series of assertions), and I have no principled objection to fast delivery--but be aware that I spend most of my time judging in a region where debate tends to be pretty traditional, so my flowing of anything beyond moderate speed is very rusty. (And for goodness sake, enunciate hyper-clearly if you're going even a tiny bit fast!) It's also probably a good bet that I'm not terribly familiar with whatever the trendiest theory arguments are these days; that doesn't necessarily mean you can't run them, just that you'll need to be extra careful to thoroughly and clearly explain both what the argument is and why it matters to the round.

My favorite rounds to judge are the ones in which I genuinely learn something. Make me want to vote for you because your arguments are interesting, thoughtful, and well-substantiated--not merely have to vote for you because your opponent dropped too much.
