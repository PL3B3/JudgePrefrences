  Did debate for 4 years in high school, meaning I am comfortable with circuit debate and I have experience judging. Weigh your arguments in the ending speeches don’t make me do it for you, by the end of the round I should not be looking over my flow deciding who won, the decision should be clear because the debaters clearly weighed the arguments so I can do the least amount of intervening to make a decision. I don’t like when debaters waste time on the Framework debate if they are not gaining/losing anything from it. If you’re gonna spend time disputing Framework make sure you weigh it and tell me why. Tell me where you are on the flow, especially if you are talking fast your speeches cannot be all over the flow and you need to signpost. Speed is fine but try to avoid spreading and if you do so you need to be very clear. Be respectful to one another, you can make your points without being aggressive/rude.
