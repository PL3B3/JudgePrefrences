  LD Philosophy:

I debated at Appleton East (WI) from 1999-2002 doing LD and Congress.

I am a casual judge, judging 3-4 tournaments per year for Appleton East (my alma mater) or James Madison Memorial (the team my brother coaches), mostly local Wisconsin tournaments, since graduating. Because of this speed and significant use of jargon is not preferred and will probably make me get lost on my flow. Debaters should expect to uphold their side of the resolution, meaning I am unlikely to vote on kritiks or attempted topicality arguments. Evidence/quotations carry no special weight just because a professor or lawyer said it, you've only managed to find someone to say what you are arguing very well. If there is some special weight the quotation should be given, be prepared to argue that there is some special reason for the consideration beyond the claims and warrants given in the quotation.
