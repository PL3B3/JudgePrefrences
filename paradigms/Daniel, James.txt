  As someone who has helped teach Lincoln Dougless debate to novices at the high school level for many years, I am very familiar with the format. I do not appreciate either competitor speaking at an unreasonably rapid pace, or "spreading." By speaking at an unreasonable speed, the debate looses its main purpose as a forum for expression and the growth of ideas.In addition, it has been my experience that when debators attempt to spread, clarity of information is sacrificed for speed, this makes it harder to flow and as a result harder to follow. I appreciate debators who are organized and can easily "go down the flow" when it's their turn. I can flow very well, but unless words are clear I won't flow the debate. If I am not writing then you probably need to adapt (a.k.a Signpost). Reading tags clearly, numbering arguments, and transitioning well are all crucial to keeping the flow neat and organized. I expect a respectful round where both competitors avoid personal attacks on one either, and do not treat each other with disrespect.When it comes to "drops," I consider a value, value criteria, contention, or observation to be "dropped" if it is not addressed in a speech that it should be addressed in, and the point will go to the other competitor at that point. When determining a winner, I base my decision on the quality of the arguments and the rebuttals. Finally, I think the debate is best when both teams are passionate about what they do and entertaining in the process, if it seems like you are really enjoying yourself, it will show in the quality of the round. I don't like mindless reading of material, I want to see a debate that's lively an full of clash. Don't read to me, speak to me!
