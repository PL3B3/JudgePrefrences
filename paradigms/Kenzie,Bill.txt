  Hello all debaters and coaches. I am afilliated with Benilde St. Margaret's HS, and this is my third year judging. I come from a theatre backround and have worked in the professional theatre my
entire career. 

I enjoy speed, yelling, theatrics of all kinds - but do be intelligible along the way and no sarcastic remarks about your fellow debater. 


In general: Give me a good standard - a lens through which to view your take on the resolution -
- give me good evidence, which should have impacts; why
your side matters.

- do cite dropped arguments if you want credit for drops, but not every
little thing
.
- give me voting issues; tell me why you win the debate - but do connect
back to your value and criterion with them.

_ I'm seeing more kritiks as time goes by and I welcome them.

Theory of course, comes with the territory and I sort it out as best I can.

- - Speaker points - I'm generous so don't worry about it unless your presentational
skills are horrific
