  Hello Debaters! I'm Mike, and I'll vote on anything (that's well articulated). Go as fast as you like. I consider myself pretty technical (i.e., I keep a clean flow and I'll hold you to it). I won't make arguments or extensions for you. That's your job! I base speaker points on a combination of skill (efficient line-by-line w. grouping, extension, cross-application, and selective skipping of irrelevant args--strategic drops) and entertainment value. I love a good metaphor and infusion of humor wherever possible. I started debating varsity policy in high school in November 2003. I twice qualified for high school nationals in policy (2005-Philadelphia, 2006-Dallas). I coached one of Colorado's best policy teams (Lincoln Garret & Courtney Pickard) from November 2006-April 2008. I debated varsity policy for the University of Denver from September 2006-September 2009. I volunteer as a policy judge at high school meets regularly every season and have done so for the past five years. Cheers!
