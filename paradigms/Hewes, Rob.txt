I am not a fan of speed and will vote for a good speed Kritik. Please distinguish between Tags and Cards. I like outlines and roadmaps. I like Impact analysis.

I dont like rudeness and will deduct speaker points for it.

I am open to almost any argument that is well presented and defended.

Framework:
I lean policy but i will vote on critical arguments (both affirmative cases and negative arguments).

Topicality:
I have voted Neg on topicality in the past .

Critiques:
Neg Critiques run by themselves should include a clear no solvency argument.



Debate is a good game; play fair.
