  I am more of a old fashion type of judge. So please stand when speaking. My philosophy is if you want someone to hear what you are saying and understand what you have to speak about, then you must speak clear and in a slow voice. I understand the desire to spread, debate is about speaking your point of view methodically with validity to support what you are saying. Lincoln Douglas this year has been my prodigy.
