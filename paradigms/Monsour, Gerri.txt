I just based on the overall content of the argument. Convince me. Don't spread faster than I can keep track, or I will dock you points. Speed is okay if it remains comprehensible. I am scoring on your ability to convince, not on your ability to regurgitate quickly.

Your rebuttals should be on point, and address the other side. 

Please be respectful of the opponent, and the real life issues being presented.
