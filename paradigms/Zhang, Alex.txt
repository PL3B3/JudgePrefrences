I debated for four years on the national circuit in LD at Pace Academy, qualifying to the TOC my junior and senior years, and coached at Bronx Science during my undergrad days at Harvard. See Ben Holguin.
Ben and I judge/think about debate in practically identical ways. 

I am now working full-time in CT an hour outside of NYC. As such, I will be at very few tournaments from now on. What this means for you, at least in the near term:

- I will know next to nothing about the topic content/lit. This means that you should not assume I know any acronyms/ terms of art specific to the topic that more active judges will know.
- However, you should not feel the need to dilute/dumb down your arguments or go slower/ be less tech etc. I just taught at NSD this past summer (2013), so I doubt I will be very rusty in my ability to evaluate rounds (if at all).

If you have any other specific questions, just ask before the round.
