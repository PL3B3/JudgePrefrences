  First off let me say I'm open to anything and everything.
Debate is educational in any shape or fashion. If I'm judging you I'm doing so for the benefit of your education, ambition and experience. Thus, I'm there for you.
With that said, if you are truly concerned, for best results tell me beforehand what you are gonna do. Especially if it's something unusual and or exotic. Whisper in my ear if you have to. Just let me know. That way I'm prepared. Surprises are over-rated.
I've never had any coach or debater tell me this practice was bad or wrong in any way. If you object to this practice let me know and I'll take it under advisement.

LD/Parli:
LD has become the most flexible of all debates recently and I think this is a good thing. I think debaters should take advantage of this and mix things up a bit. Keep in mind that LD should still be a "value" debate. So make sure your case centers around some value of some kind. I majored in Political Science and Philosophy so feel free to go crazy.
One of the best LD debates I heard was a philosophical AFF v. practical NEG wrapped in a State of Nature slug-fest that should have continued for another 6-3-7-3-4-6-3.
1AR: 4min should be outlawed. But until then, get going. No time to waste.

Policy/Parli:
Topicality- These seem to be the easiest debates to judge but some of the most boring. Remember it doesn't take two to tango here. Just have a good counter interpretation.

Counter-plans- Good disads and common sense are the best to defend against a equally good Plan.

Critiques - Please be good!!!

Theory - You might want to slow down if its a good Argument. I wouldn't want to miss it.

Oh yeah, have fun and tell me where to vote.
