  Background: I debated LD for 3 years at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California and am currently a student at the University of Chicago. During that time, I learned pretty much everything I know about debate from my teammate, Michelle Jiang, so you can ask her about my judging style if you like. 2013-2014 will be my first year judging, so if that bothers you, strike me. 

My senior year, I decided to leave the circuit for various reasons, so I haven't dealt with spreading, technical jargon, or the bizarre, twisted logic that accompanies many circuit rounds in over a year. If you're the type of debater that enjoys those aspects of the activity, be prepared to take it down a notch in front of me. 

I've never written a formal paradigm before, so I'll just list some things that I like/don't like. I'll probably update this page as my own paradigm becomes clear to me throughout the year. If you have questions or concerns, ask me before the round. 


Like:
- Clarity. Your 100 arguments are useless if they all fly above my head. 
- Persuasiveness. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Use your strengths to your advantage. For example, if you're usually a traditional/lay debater and you face a circuit debater, don't try to adjust your style. Same goes for the opposite situation. Don't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. 
- Frameworks. I usually ran framework-heavy cases loaded with substantive spikes. I'm familiar with the common philosophies used by debaters, but I'm open to hearing whatever you want to run, as long as it makes sense. 

Dislike:
- Theory. I'm sure there's a lot of theory arguments out there that can be used in legitimate circumstances. The thing is, by the time the debate reaches those circumstances, I'll probably have recognized that serious abuse is going on and discount the abusive args in my head. I've never heard a good theory debate in 3 years - they tend to be blippy, boring, and seemingly-pointless. That said, if you want to run theory, go for it. It's your debate. 
- Meanness. Don't be offensive. 


I'll give speaks based on persuasiveness. Good luck!
