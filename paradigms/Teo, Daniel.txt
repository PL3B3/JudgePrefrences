  Teo, Daniel – Judging Philosophy

1. Personal background
- Parent-judge with broad professional background in international business.
- Third year LD judge. First year judging VLD in bid tournaments. Prior experience with Berkeley (JV), Santa Clara U (NLD), State Quals (VLD), etc. 

2. Argumentation
- Clear logic, relevant supporting evidence & appropriate refutation are minimum requirements. In summaries, looking for ability to string together contentions, refutations, evidence, into a persuasive narrative, not just a rehash of points made earlier.
- Long lists of quotes and citations will be useless unless you are able to link it back to your contentions. Impressed by scrupulous preparation, in-depth understanding of opponent’s cards, or deployment of cards specifically written to refute opponent’s evidence.
- Please limit the use of Kritiks and if you do, clearly linked to specific aspects of your opponent’s position. Ensure that your own position is not similarly vulnerable to the same K, or the double-edge sword can backfire on you and lose you your round.
- Surgical questions and to the precise answers in Cross-X make for the most rewarding repartees. Stalling tactics to time out opponent will be frowned on as unsportsmanlike.

3. Theory
- Use theories, if you must, but they need to pass both objective and subjective test for reasonableness. Use only where there is material violation that could swing vote, not for every minor lapse.

4. Spreading
- Limited ability to follow arguments beyond 200-250wpm. The key challenge is in doing so without compromising clarity.

5. Speaker Points
- I clearly separate speaker points from the substantive argument, so low-point wins are not uncommon.
- Speaker points are awarded for structure, fluency/diction, clarity & passion
- Expected average points in bid tournaments ~ 27.5-28.5
