  Coach for Westridge School for Girls, Flintridge Preparatory School
I am a "tabula rasa" judge, take that as you will (this means that I attempt to go into a round with as few biases/pre-conceived notions as possible, which is largely impossible but I do try). You're debaters, I'm the judge; I won't debate the round for you.

LD: 
- Please put me on the email chain; gia.karpouzis@gmail.com
- Fine with speed, run anything you want (kritiks, disads, theory, CPs, etc) as long as at the end of the debate someone tells me who's winning and why: make it clear where on the flow I am voting for you on voters, links, impacts, solvency, yadda yadda 
- speaker points are a measure of function, not form 
- ask me questions if y'all need further clarification 

PF:
- I don't flow cross fire but it works well to serve how much you know the topic. Regardless, if you say anything important in crossfire, make sure it is in speech so I can flow it. Everything said in Final Focus needs to be said in Summary. 
- Please time yourselves and your opponent: I don't like numbers and I certainly don't like keeping track of them when y'all use them for prep.
- I don't *expect* defense from the second speaking team in the 2 but I'll certainly flow it.
- I give speaker scores based on function, not form (I don't care how fluid you are, I care what it is that you're saying). Other than that please ask me questions as you will, I vote off of whatever you tell me to vote off of. 
WORLDS:
-I did Worlds for four years in college so I'm very familiar with the event. Although Worlds places a higher emphasis on rhetoric and appeals to pathos and ethos, I will weigh arguments made with evidence over those made with just logic. That being said, a team has to tell me why to prefer an argument that is warranted and qualified versus an argument that is made from a logical link chain. I'm fine with constant standing for POI's (in fact, I expect it) - don't be afraid to make a point of rebuttal or a point of information. Don't be afraid to clarify the debate. I will not penalize you for not asking POI's apart from speaker scores. Speakers who use evidence as opposed to a lack thereof will receive higher speaker scores in comparison.
The whip speech should be clear and concise, serving to crystallize key voters or themes in the round. This means the last four minute speech should consist of 3-4 reasons why your side is winning. In this, you ought discuss the arguments made by the opposing team and why you won them, and subsequently the arguments your team made and why the opposing team failed to defeat them.
