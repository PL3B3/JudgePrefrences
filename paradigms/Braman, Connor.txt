  Four years of High School debate at La Costa Canyon HS.

Technical Stuff

I'm fine with speed as long as you clearly delineate between tags and cards. Go slower on T and Theory.

I don't like to call for evidence and I won't unless you really really want me to.

Topicality

I'll evaluate it as I see it. I really didn't ever go for T when I debated and it's not my favorite argument ever, but feel [[#|free]] to run it and go for it. Just make sure you are able to weigh voters and tell me exactly I should vote for T.

Critiques/Performance

I like the K; I ran a lot of them during my high school [[#|career]], but this doesn't mean you don't have to explain your criticism well. I'm not 100% read up on all K authors, so don't assume I understand the jargon of your authors (ie Baudrillard, Deleuze, etc). Just make sure you are able to explain the thesis of your argument and how it relates to the aff/neg.
I'm fine with performance.

Theory

I don't really have any biases on theory. If you expect me to take theory seriously you need to do more than just reread your blocks in rebuttals. You need to do some serious analysis as to why the other team should lose on theory in order for me to vote for it. If you are going for theory it should make up the majority of your rebuttals.

Other

Please do impact analysis/comparison. It makes it easier for me to evaluate a particular argument. I've gone for all types of arguments during my high school career and don't really prefer any specific arg. Be courteous during to your opponents and to your partner; it makes a difference.
