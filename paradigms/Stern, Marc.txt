  I'm a traditional judge still learning the ins and outs of the National Circuit, so please DON'T SPREAD and you may have to spend more time walking me through voters and weighing than you would with other judges. I will vote on theory or kritiks IF you make it super clear why I should vote on them, but probably don't run a kritik, and if you do, it should be simple and easy to understand. Even then, please do not run a kritik unless you absoloutely have to. Stick to stock arguments as much as possible if you want to mazimize your chance to win. For theory, don't run it if possible. I'm not the best judge to run it in front of, but if someone does something that is really abusive and you tell me why I should vote on it, I will allow theory, but go slow and be super clear. I'm not confident in my ability to evaluate theory debates because it's new to me, so I would heavily advise you not to run it, but if you must, keep it simple. Other than that, don't run any morally repulsive arguments like moral skepticism or I'll drop you immediately, and I'm not going to vote on tricks either. Lastly, try to keep your debate jargon to a minimum because I'm still learning, so even if I have a general idea of what words like "fiat" mean, you need to explain them to me if you're going to use them. Basically, your best shot to win is to run stocks arguments with no kritiks, theory, and certainly no philosophy.
