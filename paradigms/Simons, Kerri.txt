  I have been involved in forensics for over 14 years and competed at the high school and college level. I was the president of Northern Illinois University's Speech & Debate team my senior year. After graduationg, I began teaching and coaching speech and debate. I have coached and judged Public Forum, Lincoln-Douglas, and Congress debate as well as every Speech event. My philosophy is that I believe in communication and this activity as a way to hone those skills. I like unique arguments and organization. I judge off the flow, but respect and speaker points are important to me, too.
