  Daniel McCormack

I am writing this paradigm for a judge for my team. Daniel McCormack is a parent judge for Monticello High School. He began judging in 2008 when his oldest daughter Meaghan was a novice. He continues to judge LD and Public Forum for tournaments on the local, regional, and national circuits.

When asked how he feels about alternative argumentation strategies, Mr. McCormack told me "I want a special K for breakfast and theory for lunch." He's a funny guy. A sense of humor and a positive, respectful attitude would be greatly appreciated by him, in round and in life.

Aside from that, he is fine with speed and listens to any argument. I know he definitely understands and is willing to vote for any theory shell, K or case as long as you are clear and your argument is well supported and weighed against the opponent's. For example, I know he has previously voted off of discourse K's and full citations theory. He literally reads Nietzsche and Kant in his free time.
