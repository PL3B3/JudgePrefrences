  At the core, this is a communication exercise. How you present matters--you are selling your ideas. Stand for your speeches. If you must read, at least make an attempt to engage the judge.

In cross: Try not to just get clarification--probe, push, challenge.

That being said, avoid spreading. Do not sacrifice clarity and enunciation for quantity. You should be able to make your case--and win--in a normal, if not slightly increased pace.

I prefer values and warrants. Make it meaningful.

I like strong evidence, but this isn't PF. If you can use a philosophy, do it. Not a fan of hypotheticals, but I am interested in what "should be."

Don't tell my why your opponent has lost or why your argument/case is better, just make the case and I will decide the winner.

Don't waste time giving roadmaps. If you've made a good case, I don't need to be told where you're going.
