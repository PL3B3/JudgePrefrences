  I was a four year Debater on the TFA circuit so I can handle almost anything you throw my way. That being said:
-For speed I am a 7-8 but run this at your own risk. If I dont flow it, it didn't happen. Make sure you slow down on taglines.
-I am all for progressive argumentation. K debate, theory, etc is all cool with me and is evaluated a priori. But bad theory debate will annoy me and probably be voted down.
-I am traditional with the role of the ballot. I vote on Framework and who best ties into the framework. If you lose the framework i am totally cool with you reinterpreting your opponents framework and tying back into it- Most ties back into the FW wins.
-Tell me exactly how you want the round to be judged, what is important and why. It definitely makes my my flow, and my life a lot easier.
-I default to basic Util and Deon FW's. Run truth-testing and other more intricate FW's freely, but make sure their explained well.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me before round! Happy Debating!
