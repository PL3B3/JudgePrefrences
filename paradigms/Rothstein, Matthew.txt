  I graduated from Hendrick Hudson High School in 2007, and attend Oberlin College.

Being from Hendrick Hudson, I am a student/disciple of Jim Menick, a name that may be familiar to you if you've attended my high school's home tournament. This leads me to be a rather quirky judge, i.e., I like arguments that actually debate the resolution and make logical sense.

I enjoy a strong values debate like a well-aged scotch. If you extend your values, and impact your extended arguments to your values, it makes the round incredibly easy to adjudicate. And judges are much better judges when you make the round easy for them.

I will recognize cleanly extended arguments if they're dropped by your opponent even if they are unwarranted, but will weigh them significantly less than warranted arguments. And arguments that don't impact to the standards or the resolution can't be weighed, by myself or anyone else.

I don't mind speed, but I NEED clarity in order to justify it. The fastest LD debaters rarely are the clearest, and if I can't understand an argument, I won't flow it, and then you'll be extending nothing.
