Saint Vincent’s High School - Debated for Whitman College from 2003-2007
I am a Tabula Rasa judge, I'll vote on the flow. I'll pretty much vote on whatever you tell me too. But, you must have a warrant. I will not vote on dropped arguments that have no warrants. Don't just extend authors....tell me what those cards say because I hate to read cards.

I'm open to straight up or critical debate. Its nice if you can make comparative claims and explain how the da/kritik/cp interacts with case. Explaining things like how the DA turns the case is also great.

If you don't tell me how to vote I'll weigh advantages vs. DAs. I will also look to see if the cp/alternative solves for the case and assess how big a risk the net benefits impact is. In addition, I have read and I am quite familiar with post-modern philosophy, cultural studies, and gender studies. Just debate technically and with arguments you like/are comfortable with that is all I ask.

If you go for theory or T you need to spend a substantial amount of your time in the last speech explaining why. It’s a theoretical DA, so treat it that way. I'm fine with framework arguments against critical teams. I prefer framework debates involving evidence.
Speed is fine, tag team is fine as long as you don't abuse it. Clarity is good and would be nice.
