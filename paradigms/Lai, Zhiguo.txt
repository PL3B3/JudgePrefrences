- I'm a parent judge and this is my first year judging (LD Novice). 
- I prefer normal (or slow) speed as English is not my native language. Please try to avoid debate jargons or unusual words (unless you're providing definitions) for the same reason.
- My background is Electrical Engineering and I'm pretty open-minded. Hence I will listen to anything as long as you provide clear (hopefully simple too) and logical reasons for me to vote (yes, make sure to tell me your voting issues).
