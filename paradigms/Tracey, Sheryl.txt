  I am a parent judge with experience judging on the local level. My daughter debates Lincoln-Douglas for Fort Lauderdale High School and this is her third year. I have more experience judging public forum than LD but I think I'm rather partial to the argumentation style and format of LD. 
I believe debate is an educational activity that not only the debaters but the judge should learn from. Thus, I believe speeches should be given at or slightly faster than conversational speed. If you spread, I will not be able to accurately evaluate your arguments. 
Arguments can be complex but must be fleshed out. I prefer traditional LD but I'm okay with LARP debate as long as it is well explained. 
Please ask for clarification on anything that may be unclear.
