  Speed: No spreading, I like to hear and understand what you say.

Case Organization: Numbering is a blessing. The more you number, the easier it is for me to keep track of your arguments.

Coherence: I accept any argument as long as it is coherent to me. If it has a claim, warrant, and impact fully explained then I will consider it. If it doesn't, I will not, even if your opponent doesn't respond to it.

Evidence: I think that credible arguments must be supported by evidence.

Attitude: I understand that rounds can be very charged and stressful. Try to avoid being mean or rude.

Speaker Points
30: Amazing. I think you are debating your positions better than anyone else at the tournament could.
29: Fantastic. Very few people could do a better job at debating your position.
28: Good. You did what you had to do and did not have very many large mistakes.
27: All right. You did an adequate job.
26: Below Average.
25: Bad: You need major improvements.
<25: Offensive.

In the end I am looking for a debater to convince me why their side should win. I flow and will look at all arguments.
