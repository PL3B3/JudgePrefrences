I debated mainly on a traditional circuit, but I also competed on the national circuit my junior and senior years. I’ll pretty much evaluate whatever you put in front of me, however you tell me to evaluate it. I try to be tab, but everyone has predispositions, and I’m no exception. I was more of a K & performance debater. I read identity Ks, usually fem, so your weird pomo high theory K will go over my head unless you EXPLAIN YOUR ARGUMENTS. I’m probs not the best judge if you’re a framework debater because those debates kinda bore me lol, but I can get by. My threshold for speed is lower than most- you need to flash me or add me to the email chain. I’ll yell clear and slow as much as I need. Pls go a little slower on blippy theory, but I like good theory debates. LARP is chill. If you don't weigh, I can't resolve the round, and I will probably want to die. I’ll call for cards if necessary, but I really don’t want to have to do the ev comparison for you. If you’ve got any questions, ask before the round, or shoot me an email: pallaviyenn@gmail.com.
