Experience: Judged at Minnesota LD invitational tournaments for the past 4 years

In order for judging to be consistent and meaningful, I follow NFL guidelines for what arguments and tactics are preferable in LD debate. While I will listen to any arguments intently, I will favor the “classic” LD approach. Some of the following is synthesized from NFL publications:
· Lincoln Douglas Debate centers on a proposition of value, which concerns itself with what ought to be instead of what is. Neither side is permitted to offer a plan (a formalized, comprehensive proposal for implementation); rather, they should offer reasoning to support a general principle. Debaters may offer generalized, practical examples or solutions to illustrate how the general principle could guide decisions.
· Burden of proof: Each debater has the equal burden to prove the validity of his/her side of the resolution as a general principle. As the resolution is a statement of value, there is no presumption for either side. I will favor the debater has proven his/her side of the resolution more valid as a general principle by the end of the round. No debater can realistically be expected to prove complete validity or invalidity of the resolution. I will prefer quality and depth of argumentation to mere quantity of argumentation.
· Value structure – I will vote for the debater who better established a clear and cohesive relationship between the argumentation and the value structure.
· Argumentation: Debaters are obligated to construct logical chains of reasoning which lead to the conclusion of the affirmative or negative position. The nature of proof may take a variety of forms (e.g., a student’s original analysis, application of philosophy, examples, analogies, statistics, expert opinion, etc.). Arguments should be presented in a cohesive manner that shows a clear relationship to the value structure.
· Resolutionality –I will favor the debater who best addressed the central questions of the resolution.
· Clash – I will favor the debater best shows the ability to both attack his/her opponent’s case and to defend his/her own.


A couple final points:
· I will flow the entire debate round, no matter what. Making my job easier by providing a clear road maps and periodic sign-posting will be in your best interest.
· Speed is OK so long as it is fully understandable. I will raise my hand if you are going too fast to be clear.
