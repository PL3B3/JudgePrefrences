  I am a very inexperienced judge, so you will just have to bear with me.

I'm usually okay with reasonable speed, but you need to make sure you are speaking clearly as well. Tell me why I should vote for you. Explain why your arguments are better than your opponent's arguments and why they're important in the round. Other than that, just make sure you're respectful during the round.
