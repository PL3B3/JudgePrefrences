  I debated for Scarsdale High School for four years, qualifying to TOC junior and senior year and respectively making runoffs and octafinals. I currently coach Lexington. Conflicts: Scarsdale and Lexington

I will vote on any argument so long as there is an explanation as for why it links to my ballot. That said, I do not have much background in critical literature and so am not especially good at evaluating K debates. I am not predisposed towards voting against a K, but due to my lack of experience with critical literature, clearly articulating these arguments becomes all the more important. 

In terms of theory and T, I default to competing interpretations and text over spirit (when evaluating "I meets"). Make arguments in round for whatever paradigms you want. Those are just my defaults. I don't care if you run theory in shell format or paragraph form.

I was an unclear debater and so I don't give speaks based on persuasiveness of clarity, but on how well I think you executed your strategy. I will say clear and speed and won't deduct speaks.
