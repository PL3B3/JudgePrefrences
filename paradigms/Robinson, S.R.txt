TOC update: LDer's pleaes don't read theory in front of me

I have a strong affinity for kritikal arguments. I really love narratives and anything that is performative. I highly encourage you to read your narrative as a slam, because that was my other favorite activity in high school alongside debate, and I think the two are perfect in concert. I have posted two links for reference.

If you use gendered language, you will lose speaks (Edit your evidence, people!). If you misgender your opponent(s) in round, you will lose speaks. If you impose race or gender onto your opponent(s), you will lose speaks. 

I have no tolerance for the reduction of genuine structures of invisibility and violence into easy wins. Don’t co-opt someone else’s narrative. If you feel strongly about a narrative that is not yours, learn how to advocate for it responsibly.

I am willing and able to judge traditional debate, but I really wish more traditional teams would find a way to blend genuine advocacy into what they run. 

That being said, feel free to run whatever you want in front of me.
