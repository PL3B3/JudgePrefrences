  I am a parent judge and mainly judge Lincoln-Douglas High School Debate for Pinecrest High school in Southern Pines, NC.

I participated in High School Lincoln Douglas Debate and Extemporaneous Speaking for all four years of High school at Vestavia Hills High School in Birmingham AL 1986-1990.

I believe in debating the resolution and staying on topic. I will flow the round but will not vote only on the flow- a really convincing argument will always beat some minor argument backed up by a quote from the National Enquirer.

Spreading is antithetical to the purpose of LD Debate- this is value debate and you are not going to convince me by cramming three more evidence cards into the round. If you want to spread, please go do evidence-based debate instead.

I expect debaters to civil and polite to each other, unlike most of the denizens of Sunday political shows. You are the future leaders of the country and you are better than that. 8-)

We are here to have fun- please enjoy it!
