  I spent 4 years debating for Lexington High School.

I will vote on any argument made as long as it is made well. I don't like intervening so make it clear how you are winning - make sure to clearly link and warrant args on all layers on the flow. If you don't weigh, unless there is clear implicit weighing I will consider competing args a wash. Speed is fine, and I will say clear or slow if I can't understand you.

Also, virtue ethics is daqui.

Feel free to ask any questions you have before the round
