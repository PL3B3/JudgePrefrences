  BLUF: I am ok with you running pretty much anything you want. I am somewhere between a lay and a flow judge.
Background: I competed at Flower Mound High School for 2 years. I did LD most of the time, but did PF every once in a while.

General Views on debate: There isn't a type of debate that I particularly like or dislike; however, I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything. I will also try to disclose in every round.

Speed: Go as fast as you want but I'm a sucker for clarity, so it's probably better to pick a few arguments and hedge your bets instead of blowing through three underviews. Try to slow down for tags. I'll say clear if you need me too.

Da/Cp/K/Theory/Topicality/CX style args: Go for it. Full disclosure: I was not a theory/t debater in high school, and I probably won't learn how to weigh the nuances of your standards/voters in round. Run when abuse is clear, not as a strategy.

Speaks: I base speaks on the quality of argumentation in the round. As a debater I hated how hard it was to get 30 speaks, so if you debate really well you can bet you will get a 30. Still, speaks are relative. I don't know the criteria until I hear you debate.

Things I don't like
Presumption: I won't vote on presumption so don't bother running it. I assume there is always a risk of offense in the round and there is no such thing as terminal defense.Debaters not understanding their arguments: If you are going to read an argument, you have to know what it means and be able to explain it. This is especially true with dense philosophical arguments. I'm not going to do any work for you.Being racist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic, etc
Yes you can sit down and debate.

Yes you can time yourself.
Yes I'm ok with flex prep if your opponent is too.

Feel free to ask me any questions before round.
