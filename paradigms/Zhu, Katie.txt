  I’m a freshman at Georgia Tech this year and I debated at Westminster for 5 years. I was a 2A my entire debate career. I'm not familiar at all with this year's topic. 

Quick things:
Clarity over speed. I’ll call clear the first couple of times but I might give up after a while. I’ll try my best to follow what you’re saying but if I don’t flow an argument because I didn’t understand it, I won’t vote on it.Be respectful, courteous, and nice!!! If you’re mean or offensive, I will dock speaker points.I am not very familiar with high theory K literature, so the more explanation you do the better.I think the aff should defend a topical action by the USFG. I’m probably not the best judge for you if you don’t read a plan.Evidence is really important. The more you can read the opponent’s evidence and point out why their argument is wrong/….
See Colesy Cotter’s judging philosophy. I agree with her on pretty much everything.
