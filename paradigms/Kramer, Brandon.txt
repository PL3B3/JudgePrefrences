  I debated LD on the national circuit for Oxbridge Academy in Florida. I'm fine with most arguments. As a debater I always preferred judges who didn't have strong preferences towards certain arguments, so feel free to run whatever you're most comfortable with and I'll do my best to evaluate the round. If you have any questions message me on Facebook or feel free to ask before the round.
