  I am a greenhill junior, debated for three years. 



Framework - The aff must defend a topical plan. That means you defend hypothetical action of the United States federal government substantially curtailing its domestic surveillance. 

T - No biases besides I think oversight is topical. 

CP - err neg on cp theory. If the counterplan is silly, a well thought out perm is better than a theory violation/is a debate I'd rather listen to. 
I don't like consult counterplans. I'll vote on them but my opinion of them will reflect in your speaker points.
The aff should get perms if the defend a topical plan. Perms are tests of competition between two policy options. If you don't have a plan, you are not a policy option, thus you don't get perms. 

Disads - good. +.2 speaker points if you go for RIMAL.

K - I'm not the biggest fan. But that being said, you do you. The aff always gets to weigh their aff, and my default is a policymaker. I think K tricks are silly, but I think the aff is sillier if they drop k tricks. Please don't assume I know what your buzzwords mean. Even if I know, my ballot doesn't. 

Prep ends when you send the email/when the flash drive leaves the computer. If you steal prep, I'll give you the lowest speaks I'm allowed to at the tournament. 

Theory - 
2 condo is fine.


Other stuff -
CX - be snarky if you want.
I'll yell clear once, after that I'll stop flowing.
