  I am the current Debate Coach at Coral Glades High School in Coral Springs, FL.

I am generally open to any type or style of argument, as long as it is relevant and topical. Explain to me why you have upheld your standard (which can be as traditional or creative as you wish, as long as you establish why it is topical), and/or (preferably "and") your opponent has not upheld theirs, and you will win the round. I will judge the round based off of my flow, but that does not mean that dropped arguments are an automatic disqualification. The weighing of arguments is incredibly important to me, and if I judge the dropped argument to be a comparatively minor argument, then I won't vote based on that argument.

The only arguments that I generally find unpersuasive are arguments that are completely non-topical and have no relevance to the resolution or the specific cases being debated. Other than that, be creative and have fun. Just make sure you tie it into the resolution and/or your opponent's case.

However, I am not fond of speed. Clarity and basic public speaking skills are highly valued. Everything begins with clear communication.

I award speaker points based on general clarity and the quality of support for your arguments.
