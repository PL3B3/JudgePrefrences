I debated at Grapevine High School. Graduated last year.

Presumptions
I come into the round without personal bias towards any side so don't let a possible personal affiliation influence any case positions you'd like to run. l'm likely to accept it.

Speed
Speed is okay but clarity is a MUST. If I stop flowing, you're doing something wrong. Slow down and speak clearer. I ask that you slow down significantly when reading cites/tags/VS's so I can maintain a properly structured flow. This will benefit both of us.

V/VC's/Standards
Important. Make sure to link every argument back. I won't necessarily do it for you. Make sure to annunciate when stating your standards, tags, authors, ect. If I don't hear it, then your proceeding argument is unlikely to hold as much weight as you'd like.

Cross Applications
I like cross apps. Definitely use them if its convenient but be sure to tell me where to flow.

SIGN POST SIGN POST SIGN POST.

CP's 
Go for it 

Framework 
Be really organized 

Turns 
Go for it but be explicit on its functionality. 

Theory
I don't like debaters running theory just for the sake of running theory. It's lazy. I probably won't vote solely off of it unless a true violation occurs and it is ran well.

Be organized, clear and straightforward.

Attitude
Do not be rude. I hate rude debaters. I have a soft spot for the underdog/new debater so if you are clearly dominating the round, keep in mind that I pay attention to your demeanor in regards to your opponent. This won't affect the W/L on the ballot, but speaks are sure to suffer if you decide to take this route.

SP's
I'm generally pretty nice when it comes to speaks. Be VERY clear and organized. Don't go way to fast. Be considerate of your opponent.
