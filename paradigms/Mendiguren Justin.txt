  I debated for Jupiter High for 4 years

As a debater I dabbled in traditional LD but mostly stuck with public forum.

As such, I am a traditional LD judge.
I like debate to remain topical, this means no theory shells. If you come into a tournament with no preparation on the actual topic, you will not do well with me. Speed isn’t a horrible problem, but if I yell clear that means I cannot flow what you are saying, which means I can’t judge on it. Kritiks are also okay, so long as it remains logical and the debate doesn’t get too muddled. Framework is extremely important to me if it is presented in the round, but I will judge on whatever is given to me. I will disclose the round, but not always the RFD.
