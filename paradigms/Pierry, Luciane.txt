  I AM A LAY JUDGE. That means I do not understand spreading. However, I will do my best to judge off the flow.

Throughout the year, I have been judging rounds in a stock-issues format. This means:
Topicality: You have to show why it's unfair for them to read the aff. Harms: What are the problems in the status quo? Are they significant?Inherency: Are steps being taken in the status quo to solve the harms?Solvency: How does the plan specifically solve the harms?Disadvantage: The disadvantage must outweigh the harms presented by the aff. 

I find an overview on each position, explaining the thesis of the argument, helpful for how I evaluate it.
