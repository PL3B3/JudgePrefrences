  Debate Coaching Experience & Overview

I did not debate in high school or college, but I have coached debate since 2012. As of now I have only judged mostly in Georgia, but in a few out of the state. As an educator, I'm more interested in the educational aspect of debate; however, I think that the argument that people debate only for the educational value is a little absurd. This background favors me toward a more traditional style of delivery and argumentation. I would prefer you not spread. If you feel it to be of absolute necessity, you may send me your arugment. Note that sending me your argument is not a substitute for making yourself understood verbally.

Appreciated Styles of Debate

Generally speaking, I appreciate more philosophical arguments above "factual" or "statistical" arguments. A well phrased and argued framework will serve you well. 

Philosophy Experience

I'm familar with many of the typical moral arguments. I care about arguments more than authors. Philosophically, I'm generally more interested in metaphysics and epistemology rathar than ethics.

Theory

I don't like it. Using it won't guarantee a vote against you, but I probably won't do much in the way of bolstering your case.
