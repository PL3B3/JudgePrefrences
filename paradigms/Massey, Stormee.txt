  I debated for the University of Oklahoma for 5 years, and I competed in policy debate for a total of 9 years. I currently coach for Trinity High School. I am open to whatever you want to run. I ran mostly Kritiks in my career, but that does not mean I prefer/ lean toward K debate, necessarily. I have a high threshold for theory and topicality/ framework (you must have a really compelling abuse story for me to vote here). However, please don't let my philosophy change your usual strategies; I want you to do what you would usually do. Give me a reason to vote. Give me impacts. Speed is fine. Don't be rude. Have fun!
