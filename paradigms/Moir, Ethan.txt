  All Debate rounds:

CX: One of my biggest annoyances is when you don't clarify something you don't understand in the CX and it takes the rest of the round just to sort out what a specific argument meant. In other words check if your not sure then move on to what you want to know for the round.

I am fine with speed just make sure it is clear, I only worn you 2ce a speech 3 times max a round.

CX/Policy Debate:

Plans: If you want it considered in the plan, make sure it is in one of the Constructive speeches or else it is too late (counter argument to strengthen is not considered.

CP's: Counter plans are great if the case can handle them. Don't add a counter plan if you won't have enough time to show that the Aff plan is bad/worse/un-practical.

I am fine with just about anything that you want to use, CP's, DA's, critiques, etc. The one thing though is that when you must use clear impact analysis in order to make the case seem clear, concise, and strong. 

T: Topicality is the only thing that I don't really like about CX. Unless you prove that your opponent is completely off topic. The second side of that though is that if your opponent is only off topic about how your plan works as long as you show that it is your opponent that is off topic and not that your case has a structural flaw that makes it impossible to understand (basically make sure your plan is clear then clarify and if that doesn't work bring it up in the last AR/NR showing that WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID AND THEY SAID shows they were not arguing the plan correctly. DON'T BRING IN NEW INFO.

LD:

I don't have much specific LD info other that the above for both, and this:

LD is not a policy style debate it is a theory debate if all you use is news, stats, etc. to show impacts YOU WILL LOOSE. You need to show that in theory based on philosophy that your side of the topic is right and why.
