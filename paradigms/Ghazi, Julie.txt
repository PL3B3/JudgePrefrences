  I'm a sophomore at FIU. I've competed in both PFD and LD for four years, and have had experience judging both forms of debate. I'm a flow judge, so organization, especially during rebuttals, is very important to me. I don't flow cross-x, but i do pay close attention to the questions asked. I strongly believe cross-x should be used to attempt to point out holes and contradictions in the opponents case, and dislike when questions are simply asked as a way of using up time. I'm open to all sorts of arguments. Speed is fine as long as you speak clearly. I look for good, strong debates. It's important that your rebuttals are strong and that you clearly show the flaws in your opponents arguments while proving why your own points are valid.
