I am a new judge to LD, but am no stranger to debate in general. Go as fast as you like as long as you do not sacrifice clarity. In general, please be systematic about how your arguments relate to the larger debate and try not to get sidetracked on arguments that will not tip the overall balance of the debate one way or the other.

A good summary and conclusion are pretty important.
