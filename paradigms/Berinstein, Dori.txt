  Hi,

My name is Dori and I am a parent judge for Byram Hills High School. My daughter, Sammi Cannold, has been debating for 3 years and I have judged at about 2-4 tournaments each year in the Northeast. 

That said, I am pretty traditional. I can handle moderate-slow speed (and prefer slow), but I am not the right judge for 350 WPM. I prefer it when debaters make very clear voting issues and give me a good summary of the round at the end of their 2NR/2AR. 

I do not have a deep understanding of philosophy, so less complex frameworks are probably better. I will try to evaluate whichever arguments you employ, but I do not know how Kritiks/PICs/Narratives etc. function. 

I tend to give fairly good speaks, but do take into account your clarity and style. 

I have a tremendous amount of respect for what you all do, so just have fun, try to make good arguments, and I hope that my judging will be satisfactory. 

Good luck!

If you have any other questions about my preferences or style please feel free to ask me before the round.
