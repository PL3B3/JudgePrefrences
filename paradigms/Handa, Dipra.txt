  Handa, Dipra

Hi! I'm Dipra and I'm excited to be judging your round. My background is in Lincoln-Douglas debate, and you can expect me to flow your round, although I may not use the flow to make my ultimate decision. 
I appreciate clear and concise arguments with explicit sign posting. Be courteous in the round but don't let your opponent walk all over you. I obviously appreciate a good non-stock argument, but if it is clear that the argument is weak, its non-stock nature won't really matter to me. You can speak relatively quickly, but I'm not particularly comfortable with spreading, so please be aware of that. I also want to see interaction with your opponent's argument. If your rebuttals are just extensions of your own arguments, I will keep track of that on my flow and it will influence my decision. I want to see some good offensive arguments, not two ships passing in the night. 
Have a good time and show me passion that's controlled and directed towards winning the round. 
Good luck!
