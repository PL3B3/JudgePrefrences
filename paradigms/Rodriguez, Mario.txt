        I would prefer to listen to debates that were about these types of arguments:

        Framework and impact calculus 

    
    
        I give good speaker points to debaters that:

        Are fluent and professional.

    
    
        I would give low speaker points to a debater that:

        Stutter a lot, breath deeply every other word, and is rude or condescending.

    
    
        My favorite argument when I was debating was:

        The Categorical Imperative

    
    
        I won't vote on these types of arguments:

        Presumption

    
    
        Rate the following argument types

        Topicality: Don't care
Theory: Alright
Counterplans: Don't care
Disads: Awesome
Kritiks: Awesome
Framework: Awesome
Speed/Spreading: Alright

    
    
        Explain your ratings, if you like

        The timing in LD doesn't allow for great topicality debates (also the framework structure kind of makes it unnecessary in my opinion). Kritik and framework arguments are great. Disads are expected in some format, and counter plans are 'meh'.

    
    
        Comments on flowing or speed:

        If you spread, don't stutter a lot. It's annoying and hard to flow.

    
    
        Other things a team should know about?
