  I am a parent judge who has been judging LD debates for Mountain View High school for the past couple of years mainly at the Junior Varsity Levels with limited experience in upper-echelon varsity debate.

 I do try to flow the debate and can handle moderate speeds but have difficulty with very fast speech. I am looking for clear, easy to understand, signposted arguments. I am also looking for clear rebuttals in clash.

 When assigning speaker points I look for logical arguments, clarity, tone and courtesy.

 I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
