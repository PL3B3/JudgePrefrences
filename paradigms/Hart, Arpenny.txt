  I have been judging Lincoln Douglas debate for about one year.
However, I have limited experience judging upper-echalon varsity debate.

I do flow the debate, and carefully follow my notes.

I value clear, enunciated speech, and 200 words per minute is my maximum speed allowance. I like to see good clash, and excellent research to support any argument.
Please keep you jargon to a minimum.

When assigning speaker points, I look for respect, fluidity, tone and courtesy.

Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
