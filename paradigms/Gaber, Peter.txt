I just want you to do what you do best. I went to Michigan 7 week twice -- once in the juniors policy lab and once in the k lab. 

"Every debate is a debate about what debate should be about. I'm open to all interpretations of what that statement means." -- Joe Krakoff 

Kritikal Arguments
Whether it's on the aff or neg, I really like kritikal arguments -- it's what I did most of high school. That being said, I tend to agree with Kevin Hirn's judge philosophy in regards to framework (you should really go read it). 

Theory
If there's one thing that Greenstein taught me, it's that theory is one of the most interesting parts of debate. When done well, these are my favorite debates to watch. When done badly, these are my least favorite debates to watch. Do whatever you deem necessary -- condo, no neg fiat, etc -- but I will never vote for a RVI on T. Make sure there is impact calculus.

CPs/Disads
Go for it. Make sure the CPs are actually competitive and (should, most of the time) have a solvency advocate. PERMS: reading 15 perms that all mean essentially the same thing is a really good way to lose speaker points. I think you should have one or two permutations that are strong and well explained in the 2AC (just saying the word "perm" in between two cards is NOT going to cut it).
