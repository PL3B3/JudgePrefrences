  My experience in debate includes debating (mostly LD, some PF and very little CX) and competing in individual event (extemp, OO) in the UIL/NFL circuit as well as some prior college debate experience (Parli).

I value quality of arguments over quantity and have been told that my style preference is more traditional. I would rather not listen to speed as I prefer a more polished and persuasive delivery. If you speed in my round, I may refer you for a psych eval for possible mania or substance use. :) I will dock speaks for what I may perceive as rude, inappropriate, or unkind behavior. Also, as for the value and criterion clash, well, if you can take out the criterion you could feasibly win the round in my book. If you can bring in an element of philosophy in a functional way in the round, I really enjoy that. I am looking for fairly straightforward things, like a well structured argument, heavy on the warrant; don't be afraid to show me your own analysis with or without cards. Cards don't win you debates; your arguments will. On a side note, I believe that it is important that we are careful how we speak about people. So please avoid sexist, racist, or any other kind of ableist language.
