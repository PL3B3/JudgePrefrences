I think that my role as a judge is to evaluate the competing performances in the round and decide which was better.

Judge adaptation is a thing, but generally I think you should always go for the strategy you think is best regardless of how that plays out against your judges predispositions.

I don't really come to the round with many expectations about the content I'm about to witness. You should provide me with reasons why you win the debate. Beyond that, I think the debate is largely up to the debaters. 

Remember that you are in a room with other people so you should like be nice to them and not make it awkward to sit through your rudeness

I can answer any questions you have before the debate/ email eriksenmk AT gmail
