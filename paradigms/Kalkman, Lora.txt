  I'm not a debater, nor was I ever in debate. That being said, I've been judging for four years and have watched everything from Public Forum to Policy. I'll try to follow all arguments that you make, but keep in mind that I am a parent judge. Make everything as clear as possible, especially voter issues. 
Thank you and good luck.
