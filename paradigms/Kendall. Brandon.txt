  Intro: 
I'm a second year high school debate coach. I didn't debate in high school, but I've been judging LD and PF for about two years now. 

Speed/Clarity
I can handle some speed, but not policy fast.

Theory:
Not well-versed in theory at all.

Value/Value-Criteria:
A key component I judge on in every round.

Evidence:
A great case will have a fairly good deal of empirical evidence and cards.
