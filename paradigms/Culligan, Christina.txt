I really dislike cases that are all based on theory play and very little based on the issues at hand. I also do not believe that debates need to be aggressive or rude. We have enough political “cattiness” we don’t need to model that type of behavior her at this level. I also feel debate is more than reading cards- I want to see you think critically and hear your ideas too. I thank everyone for working so hard and doing productive activities like Debate in their free time. You are the leaders of tomorrow!
