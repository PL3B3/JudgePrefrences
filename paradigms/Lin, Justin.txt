My name is Justin Lin. I debated Parli, PF, and LD while in high school. I can tolerate speed but would rather not have you spread unclearly as I really do not want to miss any arguments you make.

I like analytics and explanation of each point of an argument, not a bunch of blips, overwhelming numbers, or extinction endgames. Arguments about education and other theoretical issues are all right, but I prefer the core of the debate to be about the topic. Just sufficiently address those and then move on, I would rather have you debate on the topic, straight-up with a plan and counterplan instead of the more game-like methods people are now using. Kâ€™s are cool but their relevance needs to be explained well. Justify most things you use, I would prefer you not just fling a bunch of cards at me.

Be organized and signpost and please do not be rude to your opponents. I am game for tag team cross ex. I judge debates holistically so I will not drop a team because they forgot some middling point or number and their opponent blows it up but that does not mean you are at liberty to drop major points and then try and pick them back up in the last minutes of your last rebuttal. Just give me an overview and overall understanding, tie things together and do not fixate on the minutiae. Again, I do not have extensive policy experience personally, so you may have to adjust for me.
