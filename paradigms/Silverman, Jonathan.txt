  I have not judged on the highschool topic this year. Adjust your topicality debates and arguments over acronyms accordingly.

I have debated at Binghamton for 2 years, I am open to all kinds of arguments, and will vote on any kind as long as you give me warranted reasons for why I should vote for you.
I am open to policy/critical/theory debates, but be sure to contextualize your impact calculus against your opponents' (two ships passing in the night makes it difficult to make a decision without calling for a bunch of evidence) 

If you have any other specific questions, please feel free to ask before the round.

Good Luck!
