  Experience - I have judged policy occasionally, but I don't have much experience.

Rate of speaking - I prefer slow and clear,I think speaking skills go hand in hand with debate. if your are going to go fast make sure you read your tags very clear. Ill say clear if i cant understand you.

I prefer consistent negative arguments, I err aff on conditionallity. Please don't run a Kritik, I am very unlikely to vote for one. My favorite type of debate is either case with a disadvantage or a counterplan with a net benefit.I only like Topicality if they are blatantly untopical. I value quality over quantity. If you are clear and give a good explanation of what your argument is I am more likely to vote for you, than if you read a bunch of arguments very quickly without any explanation
