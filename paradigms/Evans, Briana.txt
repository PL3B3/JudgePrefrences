What do you think the Aff burdens should be?
Presentation of Case and defense of it

What do you think the Neg burdens should be?
Neg can run whatever it wants, and I will evaluate it as long as Neg specifically addresses Aff case. I won’t vote simply on counters, etc.

How I feel about delivery (slow vs. fast)?
some speed is fine – if it is too fast and I can’t flow it, it won’t be a voter.

How I feel about generic Disads, Counter Plans, Kritiks?
Neg must address Aff case specifically in some way. Beyond that, run what you want. 

How I feel about case debates?
See above.
