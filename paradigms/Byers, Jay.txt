  I debated 2 years in high school in Kansas City Mo. I then worked with my college team at Southwest Babtist Univeristy for about a year. I know am the debate coach at Staley High School in Kansas City.

Kritiks: You can run them while I am judging, but it should be grounded in solid thought and thoery. Also it should not be your only argument in the round.

Counterplans/DAs: I'm good with both.

Topicality: It better be a good T argument or the aff really messed up or I won't be impressed with it.

Performance/Non-traditional debate: I am definitely not the judge you want. I view debate as a game with rules that should be followed. I am open to listening to these types of arguments, but have a strong bias against them.

In the end I am looking for a team to convince me why their side should win. I flow and will look at all arguments. While I can deal with speeding, I am not a fan of it. I like to hear and understand what you say.
