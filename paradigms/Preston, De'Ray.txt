  It's hard to outline all of my feelings that may be relevant to you, so feel free to ask questions before the debate starts. Here are a couple of thoughts that I think are important.

The Quality of your evidence is really important for me as a judge. Average technical debating skills are complemented by the quality the evidence and will weigh heavily in my decision. In close debates I often decide important issues by comparing the quality of your evidence on the items in contention.

I try hard to keep my personal preferences for arguments separate from the debate. I am there to judge the debate round. Deciding that some arguments are non starters would contradict that concept. Feel free to run any argument but be prepared to explain your arguments thoroughly if you expect me to vote on it. Just be sure that if you are reading a non-traditional argument that you spend time discussing the role of the ballot.

Paperless debate has become very popular and personally I'm not the biggest fan of it. Along with computer malfunctions and team inability to provide evidence for their opponents it often extends the amount of time needed to have a debate. Be organized if you plan to be paperless.

Though cross examination is not flowed in my eyes it's one I the most important aspects of the debate and the place in which you make up any ground lost during your opponents constructive. There is a very fine line between being rude and being aggressive. The key is to find the balance.

If you want to win the debate on T or theory be sure to invest significant time extending your argument early in the debate. I don't like bilppy theory arguments.
