  Hi y'all. I'm a freshman debater at Georgetown. I debated for four years in HS in Las Vegas.

Any questions: skirtsteak@gmail.com

Pre-Round "I have no idea who the hell this guy is" version:
You do you - I have minor preferences but will vote on whatever if you win it.
DA, CP - all fine with. I'll be honest: condition/consult CPs are iffy - you need to roll them on theory for this to be convincing.
K- explain the alt in the context of the aff's argument.
K affs - Fine with these. Be related to the topic somehow and we'll be good. For neg teams: T is better than framework.

My 'defaults'
Theory is a reason to reject the argument not the team.
Framework is probably exclusionary, topicality is not.
Topicality is always a voter.
Competing interps
2 advocacies are probably okay. 3-4 is iffy. 5+ is probably cheating.

General notes/pet peeves
JUDGE KICK IS STUPID. IF YOU WANT THE COUNTERPLAN KICKED, KICK IT. Aff - any reason judge kick is bad is enough for me to reject it.
Try to avoid acronyms in cards.
When extending arguments, extend the claim and the warrant. The author's name is important but not essential.
Keep your eyes on the nexus question: What arguments are going to make you win the debate? What arguments can they win the debate on? And even if they win those, why do you still win?
CX: I'm a fan of people being confident but don't be an ass.
Dropped arguments are conceded arguments. That doesn't mean be blippy and not explain it and then expect me to vote for it simply because they dropped it. Rather, it means that if they drop something, use that argument to frame the debate.
Defense is underutilized in debate.
UPDATE YOUR CARDS.
