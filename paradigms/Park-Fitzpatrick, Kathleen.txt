  Experience: High School Debate/Community Judge /School Judge, Junior State Judge, State Quals DI/PR-- 

Philosophy: I truly respect the NFL CODE--Integrity, Humility, Respect, Leadership and Service.

DEBATEI use/refer to NFL Judge Paradigm Cards---that said, I expect contestants to be respectful of their competitors, have strong control of evidence. Looking for appropriate communication skills---meaning no expressive spreading. Not overly impressed by excessive jargon, prefer well developed arguments.
