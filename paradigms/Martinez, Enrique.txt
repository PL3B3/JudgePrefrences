  Hey I'm Enrique

I debated for 4 years for Cy-Woods and now attend the University of Texas at Austin. I primarily did Lincoln Douglas but also have experience in policy and PF. During my career I qualified to TFA 3 times as well as UIL state and NFL nationals. I have seen and competed in lots of debates so I'm generally prepared for what you're going to read, however I have a few caveats. You must be explicit in your author names, argument tag-lines, impacts (important stuff etc). If you mumble anything or are unclear I'll probably miss it or discard it entirely. Debaters should do whatever they're most comfortable with in front of me. Speed is fine. Questions about how I adjudicate theory should be asked before the round if you plan to run it, else it could cost you the round and tank your speaker points. I only give RFDs after round upon request as I try to write explicit ballots with RFDs. Hence your ballot story will be important in front of me.
