  I didn't do debate, but I have a background in public speaking. I also am able grasp the necessary debate rules.

I am a Tabula Rasa judge.

I keep flow notes to keep track of what has been said, but I do not judge purely based off of flow. I judge mainly based off of how well your argument is able to sway me over your opponents.

If it is obvious you are using factually incorrect statements, that will be severely marked against you, especially if your opponent catches it and makes sure I am aware of it. 

Source your statistics and quotes.

I do like to see uncommon arguments quite a bit, but make sure they are fully explained.

I'm fine with speed, but please be clear in signposting, and don't talk so fast you lose sight of your original point. 

Be respectful to your opponents at all times. It will cost you severely in speaker points if you do not.

Don't leave your opponents contentions completely untouched.

I pay attention to cross ex always. Utilize it.

If there is time before the next round, i will always give as much verbal critique as I can, even in IEs. My goal as a judge is not only to judge your case this time, but to make sure your speaking ability and debate skills improve for the future if possible. If we're short on time, please try and get your ballots, as I will also write critique on those.
