  Debated LD for four years in high school, went to states three times. President of debate senior year.
Speed:Talk as fast as you want as long as you can still speak clearly and coherently
Values/Criteria:Major factor in decision -- make sure you uphold your value and vc through the round
Rebuttals & Crystallization:Final rebuttals are up to your discretion if you want to do line by line analysis or only voting issues, use of jargon is fine with me.
Basically I'm pretty open to whatever you guys make of the round, the round will ultimately be determined by key arguments and defense of the value/vc. Evidence is sometimes nice but not always necessary. Debate in whatever style you want, I can adapt pretty well.
