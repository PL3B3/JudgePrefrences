Public colleges and universities in the United States ought not restrict any constitutionally protected speech.
Ruiwen’s Paradigm:
In general, I'm open-minded and tend to be more holistic in my evaluation. In my mind, debate is about convincing and influencing, not about attacking or being mean or rude. I like well-researched evidence and well-organized arguments. Arguments should be delivered in a concise, effective, and respectful way. Interpret the debate for me and give me a clear justification for voting.
Things you should know:
Information source should be credible;Avoid factual, moral, or logical flaws if possible; Engage with your opponent's case. Avoid purely definition-based debates.Being gamesmanship should be kept to an absolute minimum. Speaking fast is not necessarily effective. I will intervene when you speak too fast;Utilize your time to the maximum; Be confident, but not arrogant;Be polite to your opponent and to me. Things I don’t like:
Misappropriating literature / evidence; Disingenuous or theoretical argumentation; Arguing with me after the round. Feel free to disagree with my vote, but don’t expect me to change my mind.
