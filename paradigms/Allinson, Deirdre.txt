  I’m a parent of an LD debater. In college I competed in parliamentary debate and have judged many parliamentary rounds. I’ve also judged a limited number of LD rounds over the past 2 years.

I flow rounds and will drop debaters on salient dropped points. Please signpost so I can follow the flow and extensions more easily. If you group arguments, please make that clear.

Please speak at a reasonable pace because if I can’t understand you, I can’t vote for you. Speak clearly or I will say clear or speed if your pace picks up. I will not vote on theory alone and contradictions in your case can be a voting issue if pointed out by your opponent.

Don’t get caught up in semantics. Argue important issues and support them well. If you offer a counter plan it should be substantively different from the aff case. For example, a counter plan where you just change the actor doesn’t make sense. I am fine with plan affs.
