  This is my fourth year judging parliamentary debate. I expect the debaters to speak clearly and not speak too fast. If you speak too fast and I do not understand what you said, effectively you have said nothing to me. As a courtesy, speakers should accept at least one POI from the opposing team.

 

I expect the government team to clearly establish the framework for the debate (as a policy, fact, or value round) and define the terms of the resolution. The government team must state clear contentions in support of the resolution. The opposition team must clearly refute the government team’s contentions. Any of the government team’s contentions which are not refuted will be considered to be accepted by the opposition team. The opposition team must clearly state why the resolution should be defeated with contentions of their own. 

 

The team with the best logical and analytical arguments will win the round.
