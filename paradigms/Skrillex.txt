I spent 4 years debating at Heritage High School

There are several things I like in a debate round 

1) break break neck speed reading, even if I can't understand you its good, I generally like it when people break up their voice so I only hear parts of it, honestly this is why I did this activity 

2) banging on the table or podium when you speak, always perferable 

3) INCOMPERHENSABILITY is GOLDEN

4) I like turn table performance aff's and I think there should be more of them

I allow in round music playing, even during speeches
