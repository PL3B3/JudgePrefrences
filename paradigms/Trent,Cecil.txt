  29 years as a debate coach, 8 at Memorial High School

I am a fairly old school LD coach and judge, in that I believe that one should debate the topic given, have a value and standard, and
debate at a moderate pace, with the value and standard as the central idea of the round. I will listen to wherever the debate may go, but theoretical arguments, blippy pre-standards, and policy arguments like counterplans, pics, and such are not my favorite things about what LD has become. I do not as a rule read cards after a round is over unless its authenticity has been questioned, and I simply cannot be responsible for arguments I cannot hear or are said in such a way that makes it impossible for me to write down. I can only struggle so hard in order to flow and comprehend the round.
