Judge Philosophy
I am firmly against “spreading”. It does not matter how good your case is if your arguments cannot be conveyed clearly and concisely. I’m also of the opinion that winning through volume of content rather than the quality of your arguments is not really keeping with the spirit of debate.

I appreciate good clash. It is important to identify the areas in the debate where your substantive arguments clash directly with your opponent’s substantive arguments. Not only is meaningful clash the necessary material for a good concluding speech, it makes the difference between just taking turns giving speeches and actually debating.
