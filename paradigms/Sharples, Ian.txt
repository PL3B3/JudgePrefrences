  Ian Sharples â€“ Judging Philosophy
 December 2011


Debate Experience
 - 2003-2006: Mostly LD and Parli at Centennial High School in Bakersfield, CA. I also did Congress and one tournament of Public Forum.
- 2006-2011: NPDA/NPTE Parli and NFA-LD at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, CA.
- Currently Coaching at PLNU
Judging Info
 - I haven't seen too many rounds this year between good teams that are evenly matched, so I am still learning how I evaluate those situations.
 - Overall strategic choices almost always have greater influence on my decisions than line-by-line details. Think through your endgame.
 - Most debates are lost in the LOC/MG or won in the MOC/PMR. The first scenario is far more common.
- My most frequent feedback so far has been "massive parts of this debate are irrelevant".
- I am willing to vote on any argument that is made in the round, but I have no problem ignoring things that are not arguments.
- My basic threshold for an argument is that it must be warranted, internally coherent and have a terminalized impact.
- Framework debate is important, but I usually resolve it by evaluating case and K on the same level. The exception is when teams give clear and justified prioritization.
- I think all positions are conditional all the time, unless otherwise stated.
 - On procedurals: I go for an abuse/fairness paradigm in Parli, and competing interps in LD. The difference has to do with changing v. stable resolutions.
 - I like the strategic value of critical arguments, but I still think most K lit is silly.

Other Things
 - Points: 27 = should break at this tournament, 29 & up = top tier for this tournament.
- PSCFA has this silly rule that you can't tie points, and I've gotten in the habit of following it. Apologies in advance if this inadvertently screws you out of a speaker award.
 - Like: Aristotle, Locke, Mill / Dislike: Marx, Kierkegaard, Lyotard / Entertaining: Nietzsche, Hitchens, Zizek
