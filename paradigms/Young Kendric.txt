  I debated four years of LD debate and am a first year out. I don't have a problem with speed as long as you are not abusive against your opponent with it. Argumentation is something that I'm very flexible with. Value and Standards are something that I look to first, but I will not vote on them just because it's value debate. I will vote based on what you tell me to or where the main arguments take place. I prefer you to give voters and not make me work to hard to make a decision.

I view theory as a way to defeat an argument but I don't think just because part of a case is abusive that the entire case should be thrown out of the round. I will vote on it if properly extended and impacted. I just prefer not to. Line by line and big picture arguments are both acceptable ways to cover the flow.

I believe it's your debate round, not mine, so you debate however you choose.
