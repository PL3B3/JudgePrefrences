  My exposure to debate has started in the middle of year 2013, when my daughter joined speech and debate club at her middle school. I have judged at several middle school and some high school events, since then mostly in the NFL Public Forum debates, and few LD debates as well. At every debate tournament I have been to , I see kids with passion, enthusiasm and I see their hard work as well to do do their best debates.
