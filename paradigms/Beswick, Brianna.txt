  I debated both Policy and LD in high school, and went to nationals in both events. I have judged Policy, LD, and PF and currently am on the Parli debate team at Harvard.

POLICY/CX

I will listen to whatever you say in the round, but in general I do not like kritiks, terminal impact scenarios, and topicality run for lack of anything better. I want to see clear links, brinks, and an impact calculus at the end of the round. Your chances of winning will greatly increase if you boil down the round into clear scenarios for each side at the end of the round.

No open cross ex or tag teaming.

Also, I will flow no matter how fast you are talking, but I believe that the best debates are ones that contain several superior arguments and present them coherently, rather than attempting to fit in as much evidence as possible to the detriment of clarity and level of argumentation. Speak slowly enough that I can understand everything that is being said, and do not power tag or rely on speed to cover shaky or irrelevant evidence.


LD

Again, I am not a big fan of kritiks. Other than that, I am fine with pretty much everything. I enjoy interesting and different rounds (ie, I've seen too many rounds about the social contract). That being said, don't worry, I will not vote you down due to running a standard position.


PUBLIC FORUM

Do NOT just repeat the same arguments over and over again throughout the round. I feel like many public forum debates devolve into "yes!/no!" and provide no in-depth argumentation. I know you don't have much time in your speeches, but make the most of the time.

Please try to keep cross fire civil and intelligible.
