  I debated Lincoln Douglas in high school (for Pines Charter High School) but I was more of a traditional debater( this should indicate how I evaluate rounds). That being said I don't like frivolous theory unless there is a clear problem with how your opponent is debating. I'm not the best at flowing if you spread, thus it would be best if you don't speak ridiculously fast ( especially if you have problems with clarity).

I flow up to 10 seconds after the timer goes off - finishing a sentence is cool, reading a whole new card isn't.


If you say anything blatantly sexist, racist, ableist, heteronormative,homophobic, transphobic, colonialist, classist etc. I will drop you for doing so.
