  I'm a parent judge who has been judging LD for two years now.

The most important thing when I'm determining a round is that you speak clearly at a relatively conversational pace. I'll vote on arguments that logically make sense, so make sure you outline the logic of each of your arguments very clearly. The better you explain your arguments and weigh them, the more likely I am to vote for you.
