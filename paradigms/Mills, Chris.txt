Surveillance Topic:
My extent of topic knowledge comes from working at the Georgetown Debate Seminar this summer - don't assume I know every acronym the lit talks about.

Experience:
I'm a freshmen at Georgetown who debated all four years of high school, finishing at the TOC. In terms of argument choice, against policy affs 90% of my 2nrs were T or politics (the other ten being security or cap), and against kritikal ones 50-50 split T or Marx. That being said don't be worried that the way I debate will influence how I judge - if you do a bad job debating framework I won't vote for you.

Remember, we're here to have fun, so if you are rude or offensive your speaks will be docked.

Sorry this so rushed - if you have any specific questions email me before the round at: chris.millsrodrigo@gmail.com

p.s. - I can be convinced by the argument that politics disads are not intrinsic to plan action
