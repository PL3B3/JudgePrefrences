  my paradigm was longer once, but this is a new one. most things are exactly the same with fewer words. these are the basic facts:

- despite what anyone may tell you, i am not a good debate judge, i often make incorrect decisions and give low speaker points, strike me, etc

- i'll vote on just about any argument with a well-formed, well-founded warrant. this means i don't vote on arguments that have no warrants, or that have contradictory or incomprehensible warrants.

- i can flow very fast, but if you want me to perfectly understand you, you must be clear (both orally and conceptually). if i cannot perfectly understand you, i may evaluate your arguments differently than you would have liked me to.

- be respectful, be kind, check your privilege, there are lots of different kinds of people in debate, & every one of them deserves to be treated like a human.

here are things i like & that i think you should do:

- make me rethink something, make me learn something.

- debate like a mathematician, be precise, be rigorous, don't be dodgy, don't be ambiguous.

- have lots of apt and creative analogies.

- please don't run theory, i would just rather not see it, i will vote on it if someone wins that i should, but i would rather just not, please please please.

that's it i think, ask me any questions before your round if you like, you can contact me at [hassinm1] at [tcnj] dot [edu]
