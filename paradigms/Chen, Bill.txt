  Public Forum, Policy, LD judge
Affiliation: Gabrielino High School San Gabriel, CA

Public Forum:
HS Public Forum participant for 2 years
HS Public Forum judge for 4 years

- Okay with speed
- Cordial in crossfires or I will knock down your speaker points
- Very clear voting issues in rebuttals
- Need to have clash in ideas. This is PF, not Policy or LD. Evidence and philosophy should be the backbone of the clash, but not at the forefront. 

Policy:
HS Policy participant for 3 years
HS Policy judge for 4 years

- Not a fan of topicality but if it is relevant and is not addressed, will become voting issue. 
- Unless there is substantive evidence of abuse, I find it a shoddy argument to run. 
- Okay with Ks, CPs, D/As, etc. 
- Spreading is fine with me, but if I can't hear it, then I can't hear it. 
- Voting issues need to be signposted in last rebuttal. 
- Impact analysis very key

LD: 
HS LD judge for 4 years

- Big fan of the value/value criterion debate
- Not too big on evidence in LD- keep it about the philosophy
- Okay with speech
- Last speech must lay out voters
