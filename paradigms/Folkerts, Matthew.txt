  I am a first year debater at Binghamton University, and have debated at multiple tournaments so far. I am a generally a critical debater, but as a judge I will be willing to vote for mostly any arguments that have been articulated well. I am not as aware with the policy literature base, so make sure you extend your policy arguments well. Also, I am not familiar with the high-school's resolution, so be clear on any topic related arguments or points. I am very open-minded, so any well thought out arguments can sway me one way or the other. I ask if you can slow down if you read ROB, framing arguments, and reading tag lines as well. Make sure your arguments try and create a big picture of the debate, but be specific as well. Please be respectful to one another, I will not tolerate offensive behavior directed toward any person or specific people.
