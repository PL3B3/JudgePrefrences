  I debated for Lakeville during '04-'07. I was a fellow at NDF in '07 and currently am the novice coach for Lakeville South High School. 

I have more traditional experience as a debater and that’s how I’m wired as a judge too. 

Standards are the first thing I will look to, unless you tell me something different. I will look to any arguments as long as the links are clear and it is well impacted. (This includes theory, counterplans, Ks, etc. ) 

Speed is usually fine as long as it is clear and appropriate for the round. If the debate is a mismatch, I will penalize speed as a way of getting an easy win. 

For high speaker points be confident and clear. 

Have fun, and make the debate interesting, please. :)
