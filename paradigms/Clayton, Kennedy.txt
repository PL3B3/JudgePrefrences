  For background information, I debated Congress and Policy for a year in high school. I have competed on the University of Utah debate team in parliamentary debate.

As for judging, I generally give high speaker points. I am good at following you spreading (spewing) and I will flow all the arguments made. If for some reason I cannot understand you, I will ask you to clear. I don’t let my personal biases and opinions seep into my judging of your debate – that simply wouldn’t be fair. Keep the rules of policy and we’ll get along fine. In the end, I judge off my flow and I won’t do your work for you. That being said, use your rebuttal to tell me why you win and where on the flow your arguments overwhelm your opponents. I will give you comments in the end on how to improve and where you could have lost/won, but keep in mind, please be a good sport. Side note, I will judge you based off of the nonverbal communications you give as well as the verbal, so just be nice and respectful. In the end, we’re all friends in the debate community, right? Last thing, as I mentioned, I debated in college. I’m down with you running just about anything, just be prepared to argue it well and defend it to the end!
