  I really appreciate old-fashioned weighing and framework, but not good with kritikal stuff/theory/DAs/CPs. If you want me to vote on something, the warrant and impact must be super-clear. Stock argument is perfectly fine, but unique positions are great too. Basically, if it makes sense and you explain it very well, I'll go for it.

Please be courteous to your opponent, and do not speak too quickly. I am a parent judge, fluent but ESL.

Feel free to ask about specific preferences before the round.
