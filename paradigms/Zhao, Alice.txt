  Let's start with the basics. I care a lot about signposting - make sure you do it clearly, and to enable my flowing your tags better, slow down as you give the tags so I at least get those down. That said, I am generally ok with speed provided you're just talking fast, but talking clearly. Don't go over the top though.

Now case structure: strong preference for teams that set up clear frameworks and explain why their frameworks are the preferable ones, and why they win under their framework. I've always preferred V/VC frameworks, but provided you give an explanation as to why an alternative framework is better, that's fine too.

Generally, I'd advise you to avoid using theory too often unless there's very obvious abuse going on - please don't use it as a time-suck.
