I am a UMKC debater debated for 3 years in high school at Kapaun Mt Carmel in Wichita KS.

I will evaluate the debate however you tell me to but I'll default to policymaker. If it's a K aff you need to tell me what to evaluate if you don't have a plan.

Ks: I like them they're cool. I think they're on the side of truth. I understand all the basic Ks but if you're running something weird you have to explain it well. You know what kind of Ks I'm talking about.

CPs: Counterplans need to be competitive. I like good counteprlans that have NBs in the literature base. I don't like XO CPs. 

Condo: It is ok for up to about 2. Beyond that point I would vote on condo.

T: Def matters especially if there's actually abuse. 

DAs: I like them Internal link chains should make sense. If the other team points out that it's nonsensical. 

K affs: Need to have a tie to the topic.
