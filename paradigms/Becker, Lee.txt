  Name: Lee Becker

Affiliation: St. Mark’s School of Texas

Experience: Debated for St. Mark’s on the national circuit from 2002-2005

Debates on the topic: None, enlighten me

Philosophy: 
I have no specific philosophy. I will listen to any argument you present fully and without bias. Though I personally think Kritiks are misinterpreted in the debate world, you are still more than welcome to read one because they can be interesting tools for debate and a lot of fun. I’ll vote on anything you tell me to. Be clear and organized in your argumentation and be relaxed, and we’ll all have some fun.
