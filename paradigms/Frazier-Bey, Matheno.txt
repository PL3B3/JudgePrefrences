  I am a sophomore debater at Towson University and debated in the Kansas City Urban Debate League. My coaching experience includes the Baltimore Urban Debate League and the Bay Area Urban Debate League. I coach Coppin High School in Baltimore and have judged eight rounds on this year's topic. I have been judging high school debate for two years and have judged middle school debate as well.

Although many debaters label my style as "performance" debate, I prefer some balance. It is imperative that debaters display both evidence and creativity. I want to hear warrants for your claims and a clear understanding of your case as well as stability. Debaters who speed should be VERY CLEAR. I will not fill in holes for you at the end of the round, so please be sure to have an overview and attack the other team's flaws in your ballot discussion.

Lastly, this may seem like common sense, but your ballot discussion should include the reasons you should win and reasons the other team should lose according to the framework in the round. (Tell me what to do with the ballot and why!)
