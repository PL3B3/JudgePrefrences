I prefer traditional Lincoln-Douglas style Debate. This means that the value debate is mandatory, that speakers are slow, clear and persuasive, and that the debates focus on the philosophical aspects of the resolution. My judging philosophy is based on the National Forensics League's standards for L.D. Debate.

Although I am new to Lincoln-Douglas Debate judging, I have practiced matrimonial law for over 30 years. Due to this experience, matters of legality are especially compelling to me, and I favor these arguments when all other issues are equal.
