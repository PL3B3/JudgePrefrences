  I've been out of debate for 5 years so the big thing I ask is please take it easy on me early in the year on speed. Be very clear on the tag and clear enough on the cite. 

I much prefer DA/CP debates to a Kritik debate but I will listen to either. If you want to have a Kritik debate, I expect someone to actually break down the K for me. But to me nothing beats a straight DA/CP debate.

Topicality debates are good but if you go for another argument with T in the 2NR, I will not be as receptive. I'm fine with reasonably topical cases too. If you don't show me abuse I probably won't vote on T.

Theory debates are fine but if there is no clash I will err Aff and throw out the entire flow.
