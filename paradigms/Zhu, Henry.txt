  Hi!

I'm a student at the University of Chicago and do some coaching work at King College Prep in the CDL. I debated 4 years in high school at San Dieguito Academy doing mostly policy oriented debating.

I'm open to most arguments; make the debate what you want it to be. I'm not quite as familiar with some k texts but just make sure to let me know what you want me to vote for/use the ballot for.

However that being said, I am somewhat biased towards framework as an answer to many k-affs although the burden is on the Neg to execute cleanly. That's not to say by any means that the aff cannot win. Merely, if both sides do an equal job arguing, I will default to fw.

Dropped arguments are conceded arguments. I very much believe in tech over truth tbh. 

Speed for the most part is fine but keep in mind I've been out of the activity for a couple years now. I will let you know if I need you to slow down.

Sorry this wiki is kinda all over the place, I will update/clarify as I judge more often.

Please feel free to ask me about any questions you might have.
