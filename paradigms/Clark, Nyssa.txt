  My experience in Policy Debate is two years in collegiate policy debate. 
I prefer debates grounded in actual policy. I appreciate real arguments based in logic. 
I will watch a K debate, but I'd prefer not to. 
Speed wise I can follow spreading if it is intelligible. If I cannot understand what you are saying it is exactly as if you did not say it. It is definitely in your benefit to slow down if you can't be intelligible when you spread. 
I reward intelligent and well argued disads, counter plans, and impact turns.
