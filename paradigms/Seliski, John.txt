  I am a newcomer to the LD community, finishing a PhD in Economics. This means watch your jargon, give me clear warrants and evidence to support theory, and most importantly, look for cues regarding your speed. If I stop flowing, you need to slow it down. I want extensions to be clear, and perfer not to intervene, but will default to the standards in a wash. 

Since this is welfare debate, you're treading on my personal research turf- I won't vote for economically ridiculous args, but will also not support moral repugnancy. Keep that in mind when you decide to get outlandishly creative. I don't have a problem with off-case, solvency, prestandards, etc- just be sure to not lose me in the shuffle. I won't vote on anything I don't/can't understand.
