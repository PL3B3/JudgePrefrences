  I am a parent judge at student-coached Pine View School in Sarasota, Florida. In California, I was an entertainment attorney, specializing in contracts, trademarks and copyright. Legally trained, I appreciate a good debate and recognize that there are many different styles and techniques of debate. I prefer a well thought out and organized presentation, backed by clear evidence. Give me a road map. Clarity and communication are key. Speed is not an issue; however, a fast and unintelligible speech is a distraction.

A professional demeanor, presentation and politeness will get my attention. I will note if you are listening to your opponent and evolving your argument. Ultimately, the more persuasive debater will prevail. 

You have worked hard to get here. Enjoy it! Let the games begin.
