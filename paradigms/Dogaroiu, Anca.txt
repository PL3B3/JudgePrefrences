  Do not talk too fast or I won’t get your arguments down. Numbering or denoting separation somehow is very much appreciated. My flow isn’t very tight so make it clear where you want me to be on the flow. My view is that it’s not my job to make arguments for you so I will judge whoever has the best arguments on the flow.

T: You better give me a damn good reason to vote on T but I will, makes my job easy. Unless you’re going one off T or they have a no-link on every flow (and you point this out), I will look at education before ground. Your abuse story has to be very good with specific examples to prevent me from erring aff on reasonability.

Theory: Kind of a cheap win but I’ll vote on it. I may not be happy with you though. I might dock your speaks.

Case/Disads/CP’s: All that policy stuff. I’ll vote on it but you have to explain it very well. I don’t know the high school topic very well so pretend I’m a third grader and explain why your plan works better.

K: I like. Keep the PoMo jargon to a minimum. If you run Spanos go wild it’s what I run (but know what you’re talking about). I don’t know every philosopher out there so regardless of how common you think their theories are explain them thoroughly. I don’t want to hear Baudrillard. Run Baudrillard and I will do everything in my power to vote you down.
