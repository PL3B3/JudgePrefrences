  I was a high school and college debater, but it was all so long ago that it is somewhat irrelevant. I have been a Kansas high school debate coach for a very long time.

Speed: Clarity is paramount. If you can't speak clearly without stuttering and slurring, I will not want to listen. Speed is fine, if you are clear.

Topicality: Very important. It is the gateway argument. If the plan is not topical, the substantive debate won't matter.

Case: Case debate is very important. I like to see clash on-case. Negs that ignore case in favor of generic off-case positions will be much less likely to find favor.

Disadvantages: Much prefer case-specific links over generics. Not a big fan of hyperbolic impacts. The more "real" you keep it, the better I will evaluate it.

Counter-plans: I like CPs, if they are non-topical and compete with the plan. I am old school in my belief that somebody actually needs to be on negative.

Kritiks: Ks are okay, if you do the work to show that they compete with the plan, and if you offer a reasonable alternative.

Additional Caveates: Arguments need to be fleshed-out. Don't ever expect me to fill in the blanks for you. If an argument doesn't make it to the last rebuttals, don't expect me to evaluate it. I'm probably not as bright as you, so explain arguments thoroughly. If I don't understand your argument, it's not my problem. I view debate as much more than a game, I see it as a problem-solving activity. I am not a fan of holocaust, nuclear war and extinction impacts. Biggest liar should not win.
