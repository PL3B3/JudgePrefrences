  I debated for Bainbridge High School (WA) on both the local and national circuits. I am currently a student at Claremont McKenna College. I will try to not impose my views of debate on the round. Depending on the amount of work you and your opponent do, that may be impossible. Arguments must have extended warrants and implications for my ballot. I will not create new impacts for you. I come into the round assuming that the purpose of my ballot is to vote for whoever does the better debating, but I am open to alternative ballot stories given that they are justified. Thus theory is fine as long as their is a warrant for why it is a voter. I prefer to see in-round abuse but would be open to voting off potential abuse if there is a clear justification for why, absent this theory argument, the abuse surely would have occurred. Speed is fine, and I will say clear if necessary. Beyond that, just tell me how to evaluate arguments, and try to have fun. You should be enjoying this, and I hope to see some good rounds. Feel free to send me a message on Facebook if you have any specific questions.
