  I'm a freshman at Ball State University and I've done debate on the local, state (MO), and national circuit for four years, both LD and Public Forum, and speech for five years. 

Speed: You can go as fast as you'd like so long as you can still enunciate and make your points clearly. Spreading is acceptable, but if clarity of argumentation suffers as a result, I will take it into account. I will flow the round and if I miss your tags or authors, I can't evaluate them properly.

Speaks: I tend to be fairly generous in terms of speaker points. Debate well and you'll get a high score.

Topic Knowledge: I have some knowledge of both LD and PuF topics outside of prior personal knowledge (I am a international studies major) but haven't done extensive research into either.

Theory: I love it as long as you do it well. If you can't do it well, then please don't.

K's: I was never a K debater but I understand it well enough to judge. That being said don't assume I know as much about as you do. Explain it to me and explain it well and we're all good. I tend to emote a lot (I try not to but I naturally am pretty expressive so if that worries you I'm sorry I really don't meant to) so if I look confused, it means I don't get your argument.

Misc: Don't be a jerk. I get that debate can get heated but there's a difference between having a constructive debate and being rude to your opponent, myself, or anyone else in the room.
In LD, I hold value and value criterion as tantamount. Engage, clash, go hard. If you can't defend your value and value criterion properly, I'll have trouble siding with you. For me, that's the base of your case and if it can't stand, your case will have a lot of trouble standing on its own unless it is damn good.
