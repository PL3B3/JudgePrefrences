   Alright, so this is Patrick Jenkins. I debated for four years at Churchill High School. I enjoy candle lit dinners long walks on the beach, but that's entirely beside the point.

As far as debate goes: Presentation: I don't much care how you present yourself or your arguments (as long as you're reasonably polite), but I would like to understand the round. I can flow speed but would rather I didn't have to. You will not impress me by going unnecessarily fast, so I suggest you save your energy. Regardless of speed try to be clear.

My decision: I default to the criterion if no other standard is given, or if one is not justified. I'd rather you weren't blippy. I also really don't like theory, but I understand it's necessary sometimes. Avoid it if you possibly can. I guess in the end I'll vote for any thing that is well structured, and weighed (if you're winning it).

Feel free to ask if you have any questions.
