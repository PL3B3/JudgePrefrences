  Judge Philosophy: Rodrigo Quirch â€“ Christopher Columbus High School/G. Holmes Braddock Senior High School, Miami, FL

I debated policy in High School at Christopher Columbus High School, and have been coaching and judging the Florida circuit since graduating in 2011. I also did parli debate in college.

I need to be able to understand you, and usually I can, just make sure you dont start a speech at a million miles an hour and instead quickly accelerate from a slower pace instead. I also need to be able to distinguish tags from cards in your speaking, That will just make both our lives better.

Im ok with anything really, just make sure the work is being done. With theory I want a good abuse story for me to pull the trigger.

Im also cool with performance arguments, and expirience or identity arguments, just do them well like any other argument.

To win with me as a judge you should tell me what I should be voting on and why, ie how those specific arguments o/w others, how I should be looking at the round, how my ballot functions. Essentially do the work for me.

LD - I guess you can call me a flow judge. I accept most "progressive" arguments, just the ones that make sense. I dont really like theory in LD, its not really run effectively, or well for that matter, but if you have to you have to. I dont really like skepticism. Remember that im a policy judge, thats how my brain works, so take that for how to win my ballot.


If you have any other questions you can ask me pre round or at RodrigoJQuirch@gmail.com
