Speed is fine as long as you're clear.

Weigh impacts and make comparisons. If you don't I will try to find the least interventionist way to resolve the round, even if it means voting on defense.

K's/DA's/CP's - fine. I read a lot of cap, post-colonialism, lacan, and a bunch of random stuff.

I have a low threshold for frivolous theory. I'd prefer to see an articulate abuse story. I am not the judge for you if your A-strat is to read a paragraph of theory claims.

I don't need a lot for extensions but I won't do the comparison work for you. If you extend the author and the general idea of the argument that is usually enough, however, you have to explain the implication of the extension.

If flashing takes an excessive amount of time I will take it out of your prep. If you are out of prep I will take it out of your speech.

Please ask if you have any unanswered questions.
