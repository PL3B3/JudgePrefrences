  McAllister, Kristin

I am a parent to a debate student at Brighton High School. 
I don't like progressive debate, I prefer traditional style debate that is persuasive and clear.
I want the arguments that you make to be logical and backed up by good evidence.

Speed: Go moderately slow and be very clear

Evaluation: The Framework needs to be upheld throughout the debate with logical contentions.

Theory: I am not well versed in theory and prefer that you explain it well

Voting: whoever upholds their framework and contentions is the one that wins.
