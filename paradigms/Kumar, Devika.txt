  So, I'm a lay judge.

Go slow. Focus on presentation and big picture arguments.
If you feel something is important in the round, tell me, repeatedly. 
I like sass and humor but don't be rude, I will dock speaks.
During you're last speech, list your voters, and flat out tell me why you think you should win.

I'm having my son write the rest of this paradigm sheet:
No postmodern philosophy
No spreading
No theory
Don't read topicality shells you're wasting your time, unless it's Ex-T or Fx-T then make the argument in paragraph form, without the drop the debater
Assume you must defend implementation, don't just say fiat
Stick to comparative worlds paradigm
