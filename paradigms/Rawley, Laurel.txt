Paradigm - The more logical approach is better with me. Statistics and data to support arguments are preferred over "he/she said this".
On a scale of 1 (Traditional) and 11 (Kritikal) - 6
Favorite Debate Argument: 
Least Favorite Argument: Ks and/or anything that is illogical
Won't vote on: Not that I can think of
Other broad preferences: Just be logical


Specifics - 
Likely to vote on (1 is low, 5 is high)
Topicality 3
Theory 2
Disads 3
Counterplans: 3
Kritiks 3


A good debate about Topicality If the Neg proves the Aff is outside the scope of the resolution, then I'll vote neg. However they shouldn't just rely on the argument that violating topicality is abusive to the Neg. Instead, they should focus on how they are violating topicality 
A good debate about Theory:
If it makes sense
A good debate about disads: If the disads outway the advs, then neg will win
A good debate about counterplans:
It has to be competitive and feasible
A good debate about Kritiks: Just has to be logical


Other specific argument prefences: 
N/A


Other Things:
Speed: 1
Their flow: 3
Comments on flowing/speed: I hate spreading. However I know it is necessary for some teams to do it. If you choose to spread, slow down significantly for tag lines/arguments. The rest you can spread.


Gives good speaker points (1 is low, 10 is high) - Self rated-
