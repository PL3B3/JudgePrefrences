  Hello!

I was primarily a critical debater during college, but I enjoy all debate arguments, critical or policy, so long as they are well explained. I am not a fan of Topicality arguments and will rarely, if ever, vote on it. I was a 2A/1N - I enjoy big picture, overview oriented debate, but that is not to say that I dislike technical debate. Ultimately, run whatever argument you feel gives you the best chance of winning, have fun, and treat your opponents with respect.
