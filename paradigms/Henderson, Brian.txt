  During High School I debated for four years at Glenbrook South, and I debated for a year and change at the University of Michigan. 

I am open to most all forms of argumentation (i.e. not racism or patriarchy good) but am certainly more experienced with policy style arguments. That's not to say I don't vote for or understand critical arguments (I do and have voted for them), whoever wins the debate wins. I will try my absolute best to not let my own personal experience to seep into the debate and I believe I have been very successful with this in the past. It is, however, important to note that this does mean I may not be familiar with the jargon and terms associated with some less known authors and theorists; these should be explained.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
