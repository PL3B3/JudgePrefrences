  Affiliation: Assistant Coach for Wooster High School, Ohio
Background: Coach LD, Student Congress, and Interp.

Preference:
-I flow the debate on both sides as though I was a participant.
-I judge based on solid framework, Defense of the Value and Criterion, and Effectiveness of the contentions to uphold the Value.
-I will catch when new information is introduced after the constructive, but I will only score down if the opponent adresses it in round.
-LD is a debate about competing values and the nature of the resolution, keep debate focused on the resolution.
-Any debaters with policy experience keep in mind that speed reading and stacking extraneous contentions in an attempt to overwhelm the neg will not guarantee you a winning ballot.
