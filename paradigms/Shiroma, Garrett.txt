In terms of speed, I can handle speed, but it does not mean that I like it. If you are gasping for breath or start to slur your words together, then it becomes increasingly difficult to understand and increases the likelihood that I will not flow your arguments. If you can speak quickly and clearly with appropriate roadmapping, then all the more power to you.

Topicality is like splitting hairs for me, I do not appreciate definition debates unless there is an obvious violation.

Kritical arguments should be used very sparingly. They must have strong unique arguments and links to the topic and the aff case, if you have a catch-all kritiks, then it will probably not fly with me. I would prefer good stock arguments over general kritiks.

Framework is good, either value/criterion or role of the ballot. Impacts should link to the framework, feel free to drop your framework and use your opponents if you still fit. Bad framework arguments are like bad kritiks for me.

Theory should only be run if there is a legitimate abuse of ground.

Random extras - play nice even in CX. If they say something stupid, don't laugh at them, I most likely noticed it too, just don't bring attention to yourself. I try to be as much of a tabs judge as I can, but communication is also important.
