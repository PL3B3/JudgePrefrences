  I will vote on any argument you can win. Winning an argument means establishing a claim, at least one warrant and, most importantly, explaining to me why, if you win your argument, I should vote for you. In your 2AR/2NR you should essentially give me the RFD you want me to give you; the less work I have to do to vote for you the better off you are. Put another way: IMPACT. YOUR. ARGUMENT. TELL. ME. WHY. IT. MATTERS. Otherwise I'm not likely to know why it matters.
Make sure you explain your argument. If you are running a politics scenario or counter-plan that makes reference to an acronym, you should tell me what it refers to. If you are extending an argument, explain the warrants for that argument in detail. I won't vote on an argument I can't myself explain after the round.
I rarely call up evidence unless there is a question about what a card says. Don't extend a card and tell me to call it up after the round because it's "on fire". Tell me what it says, please.
Be nice. I'm all about making people look like fools in cross-examination, but do it cordially. Yelling, being rude or being obnoxious don't get you anywhere and will almost certainly hurt your speaker points.
Go as fast as you like so long as you are clear. If you aren't clear I'll yell at you a couple of times, after that I'll just stop flowing. Give me pen time on theory and topicality. It usually takes about fifteen seconds for me to get used to the sound of someone's voice, so slow down a bit at the very start of your first speech.
I have a very liberal interpretation of what form legitimate debate can take. So long as you aren't punching someone, I think it's the other team's job to explain why you should lose. Don't expect me to have any sympathy just because the aff doesn't have a plan text, you still need to win a reason why I should reject them.

Go, fight, win. Have fun.
