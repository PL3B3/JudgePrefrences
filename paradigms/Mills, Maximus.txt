  I am currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin.You could say I'm a tab judge, because I will vote on the best and most logical argument in the round. However, there are certain things I look for in a debate round.
Remember that debate is a speaking activity and with several years of public speaking behind me, I look for several characteristics of speakers as they perform. The first of many is diction: can I understand the person clearly? This means no mumbling, no reserved voices, no mush mouth. Clear diction is a must. I also look for maintaing eye contact, averting eye contact is a bad life skill and breeds untrustworthiness. Lastly, and most importantly, good body language separates the wheat from the chaff. Stand strong, don't be awkward with your hands, and if you walk, walk with purpose. In short, I look for all skills that every great debater should master.
