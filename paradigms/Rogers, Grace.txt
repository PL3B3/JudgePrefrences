  I debated for four years from 2009-2013 at Shawnee Mission West High School in Overland Park, Kansas. Since then, I have judged a few tournaments on the last two topics and I am an assistant coach at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.

I default as a policymaker, so if you want me to vote on something different, tell me. I'm happy to answer any questions before the round. 

Disadvantages: Fine

Counterplans: Fine

Kritiks: I was not a K debater in high school at all. If you're running anything other than Cap, you're going to have to give really good overviews. Explain the role of the ballot. 

Topicality: I don't evaluate potential abuse, so don't run T unless the aff is actually untopical. 

Theory: If you're going to read theory args, go slow. It's super hard to flow if you just rattle them off and I will likely just stop flowing. Like I said in the T description, I don't evaluate potential abuse, so don't run theory unless it's actually unfair. 

If you have any other questions, ask me before the round.
