  I firmly believe that one of the biggest problems facing LD debate right now is the influx of CX style in rounds. I believe that the two should be different.
CX asks us to evaluate a specific policy, while LD should be the value discussion that would come before any policy decisions can be made. I will
first look to the value/criterion of a round to find my winner, though that is not the only thing I will vote on. Winning the value/criterion debate, however,
means you have set up the parameters to follow and you will likely win the round.
