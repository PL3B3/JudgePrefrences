  I am a parent and former lawyer. I have experience judging a local circuit, but I am not experienced at flowing speed, and you should probably not run theory in front of me. I will say clear, but I won't vote on arguments that I don't understand on the flow. Please crystallize and weigh between offense; I have no way to vote if you don't tell me how the arguments interact.
Try not to use jargon -- I will give higher speaker points to debaters who are coherent and persuasive. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me before your round. Good luck!
