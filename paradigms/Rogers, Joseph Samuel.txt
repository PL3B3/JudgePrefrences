  My name is Joseph Samuel Rogers and I am a student at La Salle University in Philadelphia. I participated in forensics in high school and have had some experience with judging debate rounds.

I expect a clean debate that focuses on the resolution and the competitors justification for supporting or negating it. A respectful tone towards each other and the judge is required in order to conduct a successful round. As a future educator, the principles of public speaking will be stressed must be present in the round; therefore, spreading and fast language is unacceptable. I am unable to adequately critique your arguments if I cannot understand you.

I further expect that you sufficiently explain why I should vote for the affirmative or negative ballot. This should be clearly defined throughout the debate round. As a judge, I will be listening closely to the components and speeches of the round, but I will not necessarily record everything said on the ballot sheet.

Courage- Dan Rather
