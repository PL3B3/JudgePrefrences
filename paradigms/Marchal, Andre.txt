  I have been involved with Speech & Debate for five years, primarily judging debates and extemp. I am not an expert, so I do not appreciate technicalities. English is not my mother tongue, so use speed and fancy wording at your own risk. You will get no credit for information I do not understand.

In terms of judging debates, I enjoy clash that is done with respect. In other words, I will vote you down if you are rude, use inappropriate language, or are obnoxious towards your opponents. Unethical behavior is a no-no, and I will not hesitate to seek the clarification of the tournament head judge before I return the ballot. Otherwise, go for it, that is why you chose to participate in debate!

The debate should be well structured, clearly communicated, with depth and evidence. Therefore, quality, well-explained arguments will be favored over quantity. Obscure and confusing interpretations will be voted down. Policy debaters, if the outcome is some kind of an apocalyptical scenario, you had better substantiate your point or you will lose credibility fast! Hair-splitting arguments are not welcome either...

As a judge, I am a facilitator, and therefore expect the teams to time each other with some cheap timer, no phone. Off time road maps are fine.

Extemp is my favorite event to judge, and I follow current affairs. I tend to favor content (quality of the arguments, flow of the presentation, understanding of the topic), so eloquence alone is not enough to win the round.

Finally, please be assured that I try to not be influenced by my personal beliefs, and will easily vote for a competitor whose beliefs I disagree with.

In summary, I assume that you chose to participate in Speech and Debate and I appreciate the time you spent preparing for the competition. Fight hard, give your best, and - regardless of your ranking - you will be a winner and will have an enjoyable tournament!
