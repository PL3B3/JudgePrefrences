  William Leiter's judging info:

I competed extensively on the national circuit in LD debate in high school and debated at the TOC twice. I am comfortable with most all LD jargon, but it may be helpful to define terms borrowed from policy given that I do not have extensive policy background.

I am comfortable with speed, but if you speak so quickly that I cannot understand you then I will say "CLEAR" and if I still cannot understand you then you're out of luck for those arguments I could not understand.

I am fine with any type or style of argumentation, but please justify why I ought to prefer any alternative voting mechanism if you plan to propose one.

I appreciate clarity, thoughtfulness, and well supported reasons to vote. I do not appreciate unnecessary speed (going fast to dump a bunch of crummy arguments instead of going fast to finish all of your good arguments) and low quality arguments intended to suck up the other debater's time.
