  I’m a 3rd year debater @ UTSA
I debated 2 years @ JCCC and 3 Years at Washburn Rural High School
TL;DR= Just do what you’re best at
I have debated as a policy debater for half my career and a K debater the other half of my career.
Judging paradigms are anti-revolutionary but we all hold biases L
Alt: tell me how it functions
Condo: If you’re good at Condo run 200 off- but that doesn't mean you will win- I do think one or two args can win or lose a debate
CP: Please tell me how it works and what the NB is
FW/T vs non-policy: Defend your method either way- if you win your Impacts O/W you win- I have voted on FW more than I have voted for the K- I have no problem striking down the K- if you prove there is a T version of the affirmative you’re in a good spot with me- all that said this is my favorite debate to have and judge-
Impact: Please have one!!! Even if it’s hippy stuff
Inherency: the cards and the deployment/defense of those cards better be top notch
K: My favorite arg. But don’t assume that means an auto win I will vote on Impact turns*
Perm: I don’t like multiple perms. Make one really good one and tell me how it works
Politics DA: I love the PTX DA!!!!
T: 2nd favorite arg- if you go for T it better be all you go for in the 2NR
