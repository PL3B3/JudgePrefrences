  I am currently a debate coach at La Canada High School. I have been the coach for approximately six years. I currently coach Public Forum, Parliamentary, Congress, and Lincoln Douglas. My debate preferences include philosophical frameworks if that is the preference of the students' debating. I appreciate students who do not spread because the argument is the primary focus of my judging.
