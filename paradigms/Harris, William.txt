  Hi all, 

I'm a recently graduated high school debater from Katy Taylor High School that currently attends the University of Texas who loved to run the K, and I will be a debater at USC in the spring. Although I have been out of debate for a few months I still read most K literature recreationally so I'm always good with you running them. Additionally, I enjoy a close-knit bond with my former teammates so I'm quite up to date on other positions on the topic. I'm fine with policy arguments, the only thing is you might make me have to think harder (i.e seven policy positions would elicit a long decision). Also, specific affs that are specific are preferred, I didn't really care for the extreme vagueness of last year's affs. Next, I always enjoy good framework arguments; I think it is almost always necessary to define what debate is and what my role is as a judge during these framework arguments, unless it's a prosaic policy round of course...

Anyways, I don't have any predispositions to any arguments, except deleuze. However, it's a very positive predisposition.

If you have any other questions make sure to ask me!
