  PF Judge

I have been an attorney for 28 years. I have developed my philosophy of judging performance in the area of advocacy from these many years of on the job work. I divide the performance into two major areas-quality of content and the effect of the delivery. The quality of content not only measures the amount of preparation by the team in their effort to understand the issue but also to be able to use the proper words to explain their position and to think on their feet to respond to new issues. The effect of delivery measures the allocation of their time, the use of their voices for emphasis, their style and delivery. The ultimate goal of an advocate is to convince the listener of the righteousness of their position. This is usually done with the proper balance of high quality content delivered in the most effective manner.
