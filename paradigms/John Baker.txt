  Hey, I debated three years for Westlake high school, I'll listen to any argument and try to weigh stuff fairly. Speed is fine, but be clear. 

A few things that may be out of the ordinary. 
1. I like impact frameworks. Genocide can outweigh nuclear war, ethics can easily come first. 
2. Debate is holistic. You can technically drop something on the line by line but have a larger organizing thesis answer the specific in application. That said, drops are drops, but they must be impacted properly
3. Cards should have warrants articulated. "Extend X evidence" is not an argument. 

Any questions, ask.
