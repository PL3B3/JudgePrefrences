You can call me Tai. I debated for 4 years in High School between 2008 and 2012, splitting it between 2 years of Policy and then 2 years of LD. My debate experience was mainly centered in the South Florida circuit with Stoneman Douglas HS, but I debated nationally and attended NDF for 2 segments. 

I am thus well versed in most technical as well as lay debate mechanics and am willing to learn as I judge anything I don't know. This includes spreading, theory, K's, etc...

I am willing and capable of accepting any type of argument in the round so long as it benefits the education of all involved, and makes sense on paper. I am open to any type of argument as well as any style of debate. I just want it to be on the flow (which it will be if it is legal and educational and such, since I do flow) and I want it explained like I've never heard the argument, or ANY argument ever. Pretend like I am a new and simple computer which will pretty much understand what you're doing if you do the work in all facets during your round. Show me where to flow, how the argument functions, and why you deserve it (so don't be rude or condescending or loud or something) and we should be chipper. Just ask me before the round with further questions as well. But generally do what you think is right based on the experience I have explained I have. 

Good luck, have fun!
