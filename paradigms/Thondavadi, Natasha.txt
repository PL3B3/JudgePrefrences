  Experience: I debated for Barrington High School in Illinois for four years and have both local and national circuit experience (at tournaments like Valley, the Glenbrooks, Mineapple, etc., so mostly Midwestern bid tournaments)

Judging Criteria: I will judge the round based exclusively on the flow. So if you drop something like an entire contention or off-case, that's a problem, but if you drop smaller points, this can be made up for through a defense of why the points you did respond to outweigh the impacts your opponent is extending from the dropped argument. This said, I will love you forever if you give me good weighing analysis in your second speech, especially if the round has been muddled and could use being broken-down to its main debates and the impacts of these re-explained. In terms of personal argument preferences, I like top-heavy cases and a lot of value criterion debate, K's, and other off-cases, but I will evaluate anything if you tell me why it should come first in the round (so even for a prioris, you need to explain what specifically about the argument makes it logically precede other arguments). 

Speed: I like speed when it is clear and used correctly, aka to put more good arguments on the flow and address all of your opponents, not to have 15 non-substantive responses to all of their points. I can probably flow around 300 wpm, but if you see me stop flowing, know to slow down if you want me to evaluate all those arguments. This means that if I hear a tagline and card name, but not the warrant, I will not regard the argument as completed (so slow down for warrants!)
