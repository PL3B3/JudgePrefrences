  I was a debater at Harvard Westlake graduating in 2009. After that I worked two summer as an instructor at VBI. For the last three years I have been pretty absent from debate and am not up to date on the most recent trends and my flowing is getting back up to speed but a bit rusty. 

I don't have too many specific guidelines for you as a debater. I encourage you to ask questions of me before your round if you have any questions. I'm fine with theory and less traditional arguments but do place a preference on persuasion over skimpy arguments. 

My biggest request is that you are polite to your opponent. I know that it is a competition but that doesn't mean you can be disrespectful. If you are rude condescending or a jerk to your opponent you will still get the win but your speaker points will suffer. 

I really love debate and the educational and social value it brings to the debaters. Be creative. Challenge yourself. And have fun.
