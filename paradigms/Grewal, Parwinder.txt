I am a parent judge of a senior LD debater. I have four years of judging LD and three years of judging Policy. Speed does not bother me; however, slow down for the value, value criterion, and taglines for contentions. I will vote on theory, topicality, critiques, counterplans, etc. if they are well presented and understandable. Being a University Professor, I like to see a lot of solid evidence for all major arguments. I will vote for whoever won the most important arguments, not necessarily the most arguments. Act professionally in rounds; do not be rude.
