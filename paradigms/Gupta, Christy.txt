  I am a parent judge and only flow traditional v/vc cases. I do not flow spreading. I value the presentation of the debate a lot, and look for strong public speaking skills as well as the intellectual work that goes into the debate. If you have any other questions about my philosophy, please feel free to check before the round with me. Above all, debate with civility. A successful debater in my eyes is respectful, articulate, and well prepared.
