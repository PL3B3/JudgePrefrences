  I did policy debate for four years in high school, and am a pretty comfortable judge.
I haven't heard any debates on this years topic, so please explain acronyms, common phrases, wording of the topic, etc.

Generally, I'm a big stock issue debater. However, I am open to all arguments as long as you can explain them in a structured way and stress why they are important. I will flow arguments, and check to see who is able to address arguments on the flow.

I'm not the best with speed, so I would recommend that you keep spreading to a minimum. However, I will try my best to keep up. If spreading too fast, I will say clear twice before I stop trying to flow your argument.

I didn't run many Ks, but I hit them occasionally. I'm open to K debate, but there needs to be a clear link between the K and the case. I also need to understand the K, and the cards you read to defend them. 

I'm also good with theory, although I prefer to have them used as a supplement than a voting issue in and of themselves.

Finally, I will use the flow to guide my decision. I will not manipulate the flow to make an argument that was not made explicitly by you.
If you are making an argument, signpost it and make it explicit. 

If you have any other questions, feel free to email me at sabrina36090@berkeley.edu I will post answers to questions here.
