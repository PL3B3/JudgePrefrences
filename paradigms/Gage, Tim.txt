Paradigm
I have markedly little paradigm except to assert that 2NRs and 1ARs must give warrant extrapolation consistent with earlier speeches. 
Plan texts need or needn't exist- it's up to the debaters to decide this. Same goes for critique texts. I dislike voting on theory. Consult CPs are lame, but I'll vote for them. DAs are good and strategic. Case debate is good; a good analytic can replace the need for three cards.
