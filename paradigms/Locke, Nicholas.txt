I am open-minded toward every argument. Whichever team debates better on the flow I will vote for. For topicality, I believe it is a gateway issue and will default to that. I also default to competing interpretations as a standard. If the negative team wins topicality, I will not evaluate the rest of the debate.
I find myself to be very open to the critique. If you can articulate it well and have a cogent framework, I will definitely vote for it. CP’s and DA’s are all evaluated in a standard way.
Overall, I will vote for run of the mill arguments and even the most absurd if it is debated well. As long as arguments are justified, I will vote for them.
