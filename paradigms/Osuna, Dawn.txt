  Osuna, Dawn

I am a lay judge who has been judging since the 2011/2012 school year. I am most comfortable judging LD and Parli. I have judged both events in both league and invitational events. I have judged both Novice and Varsity levels. At California State Championship 2014 I judged Semi final round of Parli.
LD preferences:
I prefer traditional style debate. I am ok with speed so you may spread but if I miss a point because you are speaking so fast that is on you. I do flow in my own way and is nontraditional in nature but rest assured that I am keeping track of Definitions, Values, Value Criterion and Contentions.
I like to see clash in a debate round. I believe that there needs to be clash to have a debate. Nothing bores me more than two parallel speeches on the same topic by two teams. With this being said I do want the clash to be done with Respect. No abusive language or actions during the round. Cross Examination is not a time to be rude or abusive. Stick to your points and expand them and be aggressive in your plan of attack. 
Remember this is a debate and the burden is on you to convince me that your position is the best side. By agreeing with the oppositionâ€™s side you are essentially telling me as the judge that I should vote for them.
