  Hello debaters! I am a first year judge, who loves to watch rounds and see exciting debates. I want each person to feel comfortable during the debate, and not worry about anything else. Remember, I am here to watch you do your best. I prefer that the affirmative defend the resolution, without any twists and turns. Also, on the negative side, I do not wish to see any vague interpretations of the resolution. 
Definitions: Set definitions from the affirmative side, because without them, there can be no real debate. 
Cases: Have (in LD) a very strong V/VC, as I will look for this intently. I want to make sure that when you speak through your contentions, they connect to the V/VC structure. 

Speak slowly, I wish to actually here everything. I am not looking for an entirely evidence heavy debate, so don't just give me a bulk load of numbers, explain them. Arguments should be supported with reasoning and philosophy heavy. 
And most of all, have fun! When you have a good time in the debate - and are confident - I will receive a much better interpretation of your arguments.
