  I debated for Scarsdale High School from 2010-2013. I now coach at the University School in Florida and for individual debaters from Cypress Bay, Miramonte, and LAMP. I also taught at NSD twice.

I'm willing to vote on anything, and I’ll do my best not to intervene. However, don't assume that I understand your arguments as well as you do, so it's important to clearly explain the warrant and implication of your arguments (especially in rebuttals). I’m also terrible at flowing so slow down for important arguments. I'm probably best at evaluating theory, trick, and framework debates, but any type of argument is fine. 

For speaks: If you sit down early or make the round shorter in anyway, I'll boost your speaks. I tend to give higher speaks to smart, strategic, and efficient debaters. The content of arguments doesn't matter to me as long as you're good at whatever you do. 

See Emily Massey for more information. I essentially agree with all of her views on debate. If you have any questions about my paradigm, just email Emily at emassey92@gmail.com or ask me before the round.
