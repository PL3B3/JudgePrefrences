  Overview: I am a lay judge. My son does LD. My son has tried to teach me things about tech debate including Ks, plans, counter plans, etc. I don't particularly understand these arguments. As well as that, I cannot understand spreading of any kind. I could perhaps tolerate fast speaking to an extent.FW debate: The ideas expressed in the framework is the highest level of my weighing in the round. Generally, I can understand most of these arguments. You cannot win on Framework alone however, you need to tie it in to the contention level arguments.Ks: I don't understand Kritiks well. I don't understand them at all when spreading. If you really want to run a K, convert to lay words and make it easier to understand. Make the Role of the Ballot very clear and explain it, a simple "vote to minimize _" doesn't work without good warrants.Plans/CPs/DAs: Plans and Counterplans are simple constructive cases therefore I understand them very well. Again, convert the arguments into lay and make sure not to speak too fast.Theory: I can understand that theory is used to check abuse in round, but the format is confusing to me as a lay judge. Don't run theory to waste someones time. Also don't run it with the weird format. You can read theory more informally if you illustrate to me that there is actual abuse in the round.General: Just make unique arguments and don't be afraid to say what you feel in the round. I will always give good speaker points to those that make the round a good experience regardless of win.
