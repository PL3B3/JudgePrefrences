  I believe that Lincoln Douglas Debate has to have a balance of theory as well as pragmatic evidence. I really like to see a well balanced debate that encompasses the criteria and the value in the evidence presented. Therefore, it is really important to link back every contention to the criteria and tell me how it helps to reach the value. It is also important to tell me the impact that the value has on the resolution overall. I don't vote on the best value but rather I vote for who's able to achieve their value better.
