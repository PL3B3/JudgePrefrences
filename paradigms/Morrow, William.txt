  I am a graduate of St. Louis Park HS (Minnesota) and am currently a first-year student at the University of Californiaâ€”Berkeley intending to double major in Political Science and Peace and Conflict Studies. I have no formal debate experience and I will vote for whoever persuades me more successfully that the resolution is true or false. 

However, I do have scholarly experience with political theory and legal procedures, so don't feel like you need to "dumb-down" your arguments or theoretical concepts. 

I look forward to hearing your arguments.
