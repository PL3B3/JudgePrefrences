  When judging, I look first and foremost to the framework you set up. Please make it very clear what framework you are using, justify why your framework is best, and connect all your arguments back to your framework. I'm okay with any kind of framework as long as it is clearly justified. 

When you're actually giving your arguments, I can handle a reasonable amount of speed. That said, please be sure to slow down for your taglines so I can flow those clearly. Moreover, do not go fast if you cannot speak clearly; if I can't understand you, I will not flow your argument.

Finally, in terms of theory, I have a high threshold. Don't be abusive with it, but you can use it if necessary.
