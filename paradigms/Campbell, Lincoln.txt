I have judged and coached extensively on the Alternative Energy topic, I estimate about 30-40 rounds so far. I have a very open judging philosophy in terms of argumentation, content, and speed. I am not opposed to any particular argument being used in a round as long as it is warranted, impacted out, and developed well. This does not mean I will be more captivated by your Normativity K and minor repair strat more so than a good case, politics, and competitive counterplan debate. A well thought out strategy with FRESH and HOT DAs/CPs/Ks along with in-round strategic thinking is my ideal debate :)
