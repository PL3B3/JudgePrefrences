  I am a lay/parent judge from Coral Springs High School. I have judged approximately 15 rounds over the last year and a half. Please make all arguments and rebuttals abundantly clear and well supported. Be very explicit in how your support proves your points true. If you choose to use creative arguments, be very clear on how they support your value and criterion. I will be unlikely to understand any speed above conversational. Rudeness will negatively impact your speaker points.
