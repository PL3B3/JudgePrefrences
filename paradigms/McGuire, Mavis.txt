  I am a parent judge-- judging LD for a 3rd year. 
General: 
I have no bias regarding specific arguments but all must be explained clearly. All implications need to be very clear. This holds especially true for critical arguments. I do not vote for arguments I do not understand. 
I use framework to evaluate rounds, there must be a clear impact from contentions to standard. I generally want to see a value criterion. 
I want the debaters to tell me how the round should be evaluated which means you must present some standards by which to vote. 
Specificity outweighs generic claims. 
Speed: 
I need to understand you to vote. I can’t vote on arguments that I don’t understand or that I didn’t flow. I prefer a normal speed. If I am not writing or I cannot understand you, I will drop my pen. 
Theory: 
I only vote on theory if there is clear abuse and clear links are made with implications stated clearly. 
Things I like: 
Clarity, impact analysis, in-depth explanation, comparison, and analogies/ examples. 
I like good signposting so tell me where I should be flowing at all times.
