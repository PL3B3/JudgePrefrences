  My name is Karim Noujaim I debated for 3 years at Case Western, and have been judging high school debates on and off for some time.

My basic philosophy is as follows:

1. I consider myself as a policy maker with a mixture of tabula rasa.
2. I like to see good clash on the flow, point/counter-point, plan/counter-plan, etc...
3. I am pretty much willing to listen to any argument and will grant it weight if it is shown that it is understood by those who use it.
4. I do like topicality but it has to be argued well.

Any other questions you can ask if you happen to find me as your judge
