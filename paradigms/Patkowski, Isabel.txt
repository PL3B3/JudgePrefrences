  I debated LD for four years, as well as some PF and international formats.

I think LD is too much of a ruthless high school sport, and not enough of an educational and social activity in logic, reason, research, rhetoric etc. Reading paid-for evidence in an artificially high voice is not good debate, and neither is over-complicating your arguments to confuse your opponent. Speed, obscure terminology, convoluted language and arguments you have bought are crutches-- don't be afraid to clearly present your own ideas.

Feel free to ask questions.
