  Policy Judging:
 I dont have much criteria i judge on for policy. Biggest thing i have to say is dont spew too fast. Some people have a need to get so much information in that they dont realize when they get into this kermit the frog voice and start slurring their words and just down right not saying the rest of some words. You have time so use it not to stuff as much information(which can be a huge waste of your time) as you can but enough to clear your point and time to explain.


Second, any argument is presentable, arguable and has the ability to win. A its up to the speaker on how and why its going to win. You can win an argument with even pure persuasion. If your not sure about an argument, make me sure that you intend on winning it or trying and not dropping it. Too many debates are lost on droped points and attacks left and right because they are scared that it isnt going to be right when they could just analyze on it and destroy. Keep up and never back down.
