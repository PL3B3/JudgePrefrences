  So. First a couple of things about my judging experience-
I'm a parent judge affiliated with Los Alamos High School in New Mexico. My daughter does LD on the national circuit, so I've seen national circuit rounds. That said, I haven't judged any LD or CX debate out of state. I've judged PF and speech events at Berkeley, Glenbrooks, and Grapevine.

Now about what I look for in a round-
I am of the opinion that debate should be a persuasive activity and thus I would like to see slower style.
I'm also pretty traditionalist- values and criteria are really important to how I weigh a round and I'm not fluent enough in critical or policy style argumentation to give you a fair decision.
So if you run those arguments, don't rank me very highly.

Grab-Bag-
My daughter tells me I am a point fairy. I average 28 or 29. If you run arguments I've told you not to, those points will drop quickly. The same is true if I can't understand you when you speak- either too quickly or into your computers.
I will not tolerate rude, racist, or sexist behavior in the round. If I see any of these, I will give you a loss 20.
