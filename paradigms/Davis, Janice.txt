  My son does debate. I've never judged debate before. Don't spread -- I won't understand you. I'm reasonably good at not intervening (i.e., I won't just vote for who talks pretty), but I'm not familiar with LD jargon or with very dense philosophy, so explain things clearly. Theory is a no-go. Kritiks are probably a bad idea. Explain voters. Have fun
