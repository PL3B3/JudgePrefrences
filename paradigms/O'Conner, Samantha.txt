  Samantha O’Conner: Director of Debate at Ben Davis High School (Indiana)Value and Criterion: 
I believe that both of these elements are essential to a Lincoln Douglas debate round. They should be the primary focus throughout the round. The selected criterion should be thoroughly explained and justified rather than name dropping a famous philosopher and calling it a day. In addition to these items, I prefer clear judging standards to be provided for the round.
Definitions: 
I do not enjoy debates centered on definitions; so as a result, I prefer the definitions to set a fair parameter for both competitors in the round. However, if there is a legitimate argument over the framer’s intent and meaning of words in the resolution than the arguments need to be warranted and clearly impacted. 
Evidence:
Lincoln Douglas cases need evidence even though they are evaluating hypothetical situations. Statistics, expert analysis, philosophy, psychology, etc can all be useful data to help support the case. The evidence needs to be accompanied by original analysis from the debater including a warrant and the impact of the argument over all.
Voters:
Providing voting issues at the end of the round is preferable but not necessary. The winner of the round will be determined based on who has won the major issues in the round.
Delivery: 
I prefer that the debate be more about quality arguments than speed. Moderate speeds are fine. If I put my pen down, you are going too fast. I do want eye contact, vocal quality, etc. but the quality of arguments are a much bigger influence on my voting than delivery skills. Feel free to use debate specific terms (cross apply, impact, drop, etc.) but make sure that you are completing the arguments and not simply applying labels with no explanation.
