  Hello, 

I've judged LD for about a year and a half, and as a result know what debaters tend to run. I also know what I don't like debaters to run. 

DO NOT run
-K's
-Theory shells (if your opponent is abusive, just say so and say why)
-Plans
-CP's
-Disads
-Meta-ethics

Speak slowly and well, do not spread or I'll stop flowing. Impact clearly, and make even clearer links. I like a good framework debate, and if you want to win with me as your judge, DON'T FORGET THE FRAMEWORK!

Other than that, good luck!
