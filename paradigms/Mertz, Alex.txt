Affiliation: E.L. Meyers High School Wilkes-Barre PA
Events: CX, LD, and PFD

Paradigm for CX:

I am basically a policy maker, but will listen to most arguments. I do not like Ks at all and would prefer teams not run them. I do still vote on T, but will also vote on abuse and time suck arguments. I hate when teams make solid arguments, especially Ts and then kick them so if Aff runs an abuse argument well I would consider it. Speed is okay, as long as you are clear. I am a flow intensive judge, and if it doesn't make it on my flow it doesn't count in the round. I generally do not interfere in rounds.

Paradigm for LD:
I still believe in the concept of a value debate, and like my LD debates to have a dose of philosophy. That being said, I understand the new school of thought that has created evidence heavy LD debates. To me it's a proper balance that wins rounds. I do not vote on Policy arguments here. I don't want to hear about T, or inherent barriers, or plans because that's not what this event is about. I vote primarily on value clash, but agree that well run contentions can help carry around. 

I am especially fond of well crafted observational frameworks for the round.
