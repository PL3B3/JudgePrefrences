DO NOT READ KRITIKS PLEASE.

I don't have too many strong opinions about debate, and will vote on pretty much anything with a warrant thats at least minimally developed. 

I default reasonability and drop the arg on theory. I'm most familiar with theory, some tricks, and framework debates. I'm probably not the best judge for extremely in depth util debates so I would stay away from LARPing when debating in front of me. I also prefer not to hear Ks.

The biggest thing is to be clear when you spread, and emphasize transitions when you are making a new argument.
