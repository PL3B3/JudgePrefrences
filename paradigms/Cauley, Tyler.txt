About me
 I come from a small school in rural Oklahoma where funding isn’t huge. Most of my debating style is self-taught, but I worked with a private coach @ Berkely. I competed in both local level policy and Nat circuit LD. I'm currently a policy debater at the University of Central Oklahoma.
 
Speaks
 Speed is fine. Know your limits. I would prefer you speak slow if you can’t go fast and be clear, but if you are confident in your spreading, go for it. I will yell clear twice, then my pen goes down. I love to laugh. If you can make a fun debate space where everyone is having a good time w/out it being toxic or degrading to others or your opponent, you’re getting good speaks. I start at 28.
  
 K’s
 This is the majority of debating I did in LD & Policy and they are generally fun arguments. Just do what you love doing here and I'll listen.
 
Performance
 Yeah
 
 
 
Theory
 I’ll vote on condo and whatnot. If you throw out some theory make sure the abuse story is clear and I’m following along. I don’t want to vote on ASPEC or WiFi theory, but I will If mishandled.
  
 



If you run shit like racism good, patriarchy good, genocide good, etc, you will probably see my eyes get wide, and, if you look close enough, you could probably see me sign the ballot for your opponent.
 
 

Have fun and I will vote on the flow.
