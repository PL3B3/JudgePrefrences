  "Dinosaur" is the word some debaters may apply to me.

I prefer persuasive speaking and philosophical analysis of the topic.  When in doubt, read the rules/description of the event as the NCFL and NSDA describe it.

I HATE SPEED. I have coached for 25 years and I am an ex-policy debater. I know the difference between policy and LD and it's not the number of speakers. Pretend you're trying to be Lincoln or Douglas and you'll stand a much better chance of winning. LD was invented to get away from the problems of policy.

Be persuasive, be philosophical, and have lots of examples to make the philosophy clear.
