  I debated LD on the national circuit for 4 years during high school as part of University School. I qualified to TOCs my senior year. I taught LD at the Champion Briefs Institute. 

I evaluate the round through a framework / resolutional burden. 
I don't judge too often, so I may be a little rusty with speed (so please articulate, don't speak too softly, and emphasize accordingly). I also don't have any biases against any arguments, although there are some arguments that I am better at evaluating then other arguments. For example, I'm not the best at evaluating Util debates / policy arguments / critiques / micro political stuff. I particularly enjoy philosophy debates and theory (as a debater, I would engage in those types of debates). 

Substance: I default to truth testing. I think framework arguments / tricks, such as contingent standards, are really cool. However, please make sure to explain dense philosophical arguments well in extensions / later rebuttals. 
Theory: Please slow down on the interp, I default to competing interpretations. 

Thanks, enjoy debating!
