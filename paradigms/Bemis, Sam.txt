(THIS IS FOR ALTA JUDGING LD)
Paradigm
I started my debate career doing CX, so I do admit that history influences how I judge a round. That's not to say I value a progressive round over a traditional one, it just means that I am going to flow very thoroughly and vote for the best impacted/warranted arguments under whatever framework was best supported. Essentially, at the end of a round, I look at my flow, see who won framework, and then look to the final rebuttals to find the winner under that framework. If you didn't really read that, basically I <3 Flow and Framework.

Specifics
Traditional v. Progressive: I LOVE a good traditional round just as much as I LOVE an organized progressive round. Really, I do not have a preference. Debate however you do best.
Kritiks: Great. I think LDers tend to forget about framework when they use a K, so make sure you have a supporting one. Please don't expect me to know your very obscure literature – if you can't clearly explain it to me in the round I won't vote on it. Here's a secret: I love Anthro, Gender, and Cap.
Theory: I think theory should be a legitimate check on abuse. Please don't run it to be sketchy; I'll have a very hard time voting on it anyway.
Other off-case: Go ahead, just please make sure you have all the unique parts of the argument. Sometimes people just read Inherency on a DA and are like "Boom, I win I'm a policy kid now," and that just makes me sad.

Debate is an amazing space, please keep it that way. Treat everyone with respect and come ready to learn. If there is ANY offensive behavior or language I will drop you, no matter how much you were winning. I will not tolerate it.

LAST THING – Please do not shake my hand. If you try to, first, I'll know you didn't read this, and second, I will just say I am sick even if I'm not.
