  I feel that paradigms are more often chest-beating by a judge, than truly helpful to a debater. As such, I will list my likes and my experience, and not any negatives ("since negative just brings everybody down").

I enjoy intelligent waggish debate that demonstrates civility and startegy. Courtesy is important to me as a judge, and often speaks are awarded more for that than speaking style-since rounds differ in delivery, but must maintain a decorum regardless. I do not dismiss any argument, however, a few things are engraved in my mind (e.g., throwing acid in a womans face who wishes to attend school is wrong). 

I did LD in high school for four years and debated CEDA in college. I have coached for over twenty years.
