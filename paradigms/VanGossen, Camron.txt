I debated 4 years at Caddo Magnet High School and have recentl started coaching Parkway
This is my third year to judge policy debate, I will vote for whoever wins the debate in my opinion. I will vote on any argument, just win it. Here are my viewpoints on different arguments. When reading fast, make sure I can distinguish between the tag and the card. Speed is not an issue, go for it.
Framework:
I tend to err for the affirmative framework set up in 1AC, but if you win framework you can have your Kritik, just make sure to explain the link well.
Topicality:
I have voted Neg on topicality in the past. I believe however, that if the negative goes for topicality, they should have a wonderful in round abuse story. I find it almost impossible to vote an affirmative team down on potential abuse alone. Standards are incredibly important to me, so argue them well if you want to win a T debate.

Counterplans:
Don't have a preference on Counterplans. Ran plenty of them, I don' believe PICS are bad unless you can prove abuse. I'm all for conditionality unless you have a good abuse story. Make sure you can defend perf con if you do go Cond. CP and K

Kritiks:
Make sure to outline an understandable link scenario. The k is probably my favorite argument, but you have to sell the story. Make sure you win the link.
