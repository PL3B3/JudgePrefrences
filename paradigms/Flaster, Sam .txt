  Hey yall, I'm Sam Wolf Blitzer Flaster.

History: TOC Attendee (Uninvited) 2011, Former Chief Economist for the World Bank, Pulitzer Prize winning book reader, 2010.
Basically, I used to drop truth and stack 30 speaks on 30 speaks.

Conflicts: Any school south of the mason-dixon line. You will be dropped. Please strike me.

I can handle anything. I like speed, but I won't shout clear, so you should read me to make sure I can understand.
I like Food. Bring me food, up your speaks.

I'm a sucker for the K, I'll admit. I'm well versed in Heidegger, Nietsche, Baudrillard, and Paul David Hewson. Anything else, you gon have to elaborate and be super clear.
Loves:
Daoism
Skep
Give the land back cp
Wipeout
Project LDers
The Truth
A nice Deont/Util Debate.
Speaking foreign languages in round (I will understand and agreeably boost your speaks for Spanish, Sign Language, Moroccan Arabic, and sometimes Korean).
Hearing New Perspectives (as long as they aren't real stupid)

REALLY LOVES:
The Truth.
Say something cool like "Everything is a draft!" or "Human behavior is conditioned upon what we can or can't get away with" so I can learn some stuff.

Hates:
Hitler
Racism
Ethnocentricism
Anti-Semitism
Whiteness
Practical Reason (its too complicated!)

WATCH ME. If I stop flowing, time to legit your shit up. If I nod I like your argument, If I smile I think its stupid.

Note: There are exceptions to every rule.
Love, 
Sam
