  Summary: Run arguments that you are comfortable with. I will vote on anything but make sure you know the arguments you are running. Cross-ex is devastating on revealing shoddy link chains.
About Me: Junior at the University School of Nashville. 3 years of policy debate including this topic. I have been a mostly kritikal 2N going one or two off every round.

Argument Preferences:
CP: I will vote on cheaty CPs if you lose the tech debate, but I’m more aff leaning if you choose to go for them. 
DA: Impact Comparison goes far.
K: I’m familiar with most of the literature. Even if I don’t know the specific author you are reading, you should define your terms and your analysis should be specific enough that I can grasp the argument and evaluate it.
T: Mostly ineffective in creating a limited topic. It can be strategic if you’re a small team. I default to reasonability vs. most affs.
K affs: Win framework + defend method. Perms are probably illegit if the link is decent to the method/analysis.
Theory: Warrant out your arguments and don’t spread through blocks. The words “strat skew” mean nothing to me without a warrant. I will not vote on extrapolation in the next speech on these words alone.
Cheating will be handled at my discretion - don't do it.
Ask before the round any questions you have on this philosophy!
