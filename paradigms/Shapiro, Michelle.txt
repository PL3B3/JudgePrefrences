  I debated for three years at St. Louis Park High School in Minnesota, and graduated in 2008.

I'm open to any argument as long as it's articulated and explained in a way that I can understand. If I don't understand an argument, I won't vote on it. Speed's fine as long as it doesn't impair clarity; I'll yell "clear" if it becomes a problem. Any other questions you have, feel free to ask me before the round.
