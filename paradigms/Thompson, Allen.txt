Policy/LD/PFD General Information
- Read whatever you want, I will flow it. Yes there are arguments I prefer and others I dislike, but I’ll flow whatever is presented in the round. As far as intervention, I only intervene on completely offensive args like rape good, sexism good, racism good, etc.
- Debate however you see fit. Different people have different approaches to communication and argumentation. With that said, speed is desirable but not a necessity. Also, I may call for cards after rounds if need be, especially if interpretation of evd is the only thing being argued. On the other hand, I do believe analysis is probably more important than evd because I believe evd is there to support good analysis.
- Use your cross-ex effectively. Use it to set yourself up for later and use it to trap your opponents. Nothing is more infuriating than a wasted cross.
- Debate is supposed to be fun. It is for this reason any Star Wars references, funny jokes, or quips in the round might result in a few extra speaks.



Policy Debate

- Kritiks
I love K, but only when you actually understand what you’re arguing. Make sure to explain the argument and provide in-depth analysis. Additionally, I do not think you have to win the alt in order to win the k, especially if there is a lot of offense elsewhere in the k. Directly linking to this, I find good permutation debates easy for the aff to win on a bad alt.

- Counterplans:
Who doesn’t love a god PIC? And I prefer the POST acronym (perm, offense, solvency, theory) when answering CPs, but you can do whatever you see fit. AoA & AoE CPs generally flow AFF unless you can argue the true merits of the new agent.

- Disadvantages:
This strategic method should be utilized in most rounds. There are almost always at least 3 or 4 disadvantages to any one plan.

- Topicality:
T debates can be interesting, but that doesn’t happen very often. I honestly don’t like voting on T because I see it more as a time suck than anything else, but it is a great strat nonetheless. Arguing standards and definitions does not allow for an educational debate, but if that’s all that’s carried across the flow, and it’s argued correctly, I will vote on it. Additionally, definitions must have context.

- Theory:
I am easily persuaded either way on most theoretical issues as long as they’re warranted. And yes, conditionality is okay in my eyes.

- Framework:
Framework must be set at the top of the flow. I need a lens in which to view the round and fill out my ballot.



Lincoln Douglas Debate

- Value/Criterion:
I prefer traditional style V/C debates over policy centered LD rounds. And yes, that means I want to hear where/whom your ideas originated from (Heidegger, Aristotle, Kant, Chomsky, or whomever). I know that traditional-style, philosophy based rounds aren't normative right now, but that's the point of LD & that's what I want to hear. If you want to argue policy in an LD round, please do it elsewhere.

- Framework:
I don't care what happens here as long as a few very basic things happen: first, if you're running meta ethics or an odd framework, this is where I need you to take your time. Secondly, framework debates can easily win you my ballot. Focus on comparing the two positions offered to me, and convince me why one can earn my ballot. Finally, there always has to be a very strong connection to the resolution for me in the AC. I don't care what you run, as long as you can justify to me why it would make sense to discuss it with today's resolution.

- Theory:
If you run theory because they did something blatantly abusive, I will always vote on it first. However, if you run theory for anything else, it generally doesn't weigh as much as other arguments in the round. You really have to push your warrants here.
