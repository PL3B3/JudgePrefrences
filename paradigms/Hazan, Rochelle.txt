  About
I am a mother of two LDers and this is my first year judging. I'm very unbiased toward this topic and am generally okay with you running whatever as long as it's not abusive. In order for me to vote for you, I expect you to speak clear, at a reasonable pace, and explain to me why I should go with your side. However, I enjoy framework and value debates very much, and sometimes weigh my vote based on those.
