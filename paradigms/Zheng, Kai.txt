Debated 4 years at Bellaire HS. Currently at UT Dallas.

Before I begin, a few things must be cleared. Although I try to keep my bias out of all debates, it is inevitable at times. Debate is a very educational competition, with very little real world impacts. However, in the debate world, every impact will be weighed just as plausible as any other.

One thing: a good piece of evidence out weighs 10 bad pieces of evidence

I am a Policy Maker. Give me the better policy, explain this policy, tell me why I should vote for this policy and without a doubt I will vote for you. Any policy is viable. Just make sure your policy is clearly the better option.

Topicality: debates are, well they are topical debates. These debates do not pith one policy against another. While I may vote on T, I find this debate extremely boring.

Dis Ads: are great. The better you run your dis ad and link it to the aff plan, the more inclined i will be to vote on it. Give me a very well ran dis ad and the round is yours.

CPs: are also great but not required. Make sure you do not run a CP as a time suck. If you are not going to stick by that CP, do not keep sticking with it until the 2AR.

Kritiks: are ok. I do occasionally vote for K, but the negative team must make sure they know what they are talking about. Do not run this as a time suck.

Some conclusive words: Good luck and have fun.
