  I am a JV/Varsity-level debate judge. I was a trial attorney for several years and then became a teacher and now a high school principal. I value a traditional value-based debate. I believe the purpose of debate is to teach the skills of communication and advocacy in the form of the respectful, well chosen word or argument. I look for logic and elegance and will look unfavorably on attempts to overwhelm an opponent through the gimmick of talking fast to make so many arguments that the opponent is essentially gamed into not being able to respond to each one. If you start spreading, I will likely lose attention and begin getting distracted, thinking about what coach would possibly have taught you that this is a skill worth learning? So if you want to spread, avoid me! If you want to demonstrate your ability to speak clearly, concisely, and coherently from a foundation rooted in ethics and values--allowing for a rhetorical pause or breath now and again to emphasize some particularly important point--then I would be honored to be a judge for you. I value evidence that is well developed, where you connect the dots, rather than a ream of data and examples where you expect me to connect the dots for you! Use a well chosen metaphor, demonstrate your ability to make really complex things simple, and you will have my total attention.
