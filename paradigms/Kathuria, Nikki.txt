  I did policy in high school for three years so I have some experience. I usually judge JV at national tournaments and open at more local ones. I'm fine with spreading but i will tell you to be clear, and if I don't catch it on my flow, I can't vote for it. I like impact calc as early as possible and tend to vote on the impact level. I'm okay with the K and kritikal affs as long as you explain them well and tell me why I should evaluate your framework over a policy-making framework, especially for discourse/representations Ks.
