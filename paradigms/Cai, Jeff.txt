  I debated 3 years LD for Ridge HS. I'm currently studying math at Harvard.

I can't flow high speeds, so please slow down if I say to. I'll evaluate all arguments as objectively as I can. I am neutral as to theory or Ks; the quality of the argument matters more. There are few things I won't vote off of, but they include:
Arguments denying the truth of math or scienceArguments that make minimal senseDropped blips that become expanded in the 1AR/2NR/2AR
