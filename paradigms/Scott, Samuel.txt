Paradigm in a nutshell
I'm a Tab Judge, I'll begin with no assumptions and will expect you to argue how I should evaluate the round. I prefer judging as a Policymaker when possible.I'm not the best with speed. Here's the deal: there's an inverse relationship between how complex your arguments can be and how fast you can go for me. So, can you spread? Yes. But if you choose to do so, make sure you clarify key issues in the debate by temporarily slowing down.
Specifics
I'm not likely to vote off theory.I really like crystallization and clear voters.SLOW DOWN when reading card names and tags.I like it when opponents are called out for power tagging their arguments. Read their evidence, and tell me if it actually says what they claim it does.Speaker points will mainly be based on your clarity, but other factors include eye contact, showing your opponent respect, and professionalism. I'll give good spreaders high speaker points, but this may be at the cost of me fully understanding your arguments.
For further clarification, feel free to ask me questions before the round when both teams are present.
