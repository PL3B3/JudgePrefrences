Trial Attorney
Parent Judge, 2nd year



Please do not make any arguments that justify racism, sexism, or homophobic practices. I'll drop you.



I won't dock you directly if I can't keep up. But please be coherent. I want to be convinced. As a practicing trial attorney, I understand that almost every argument has two points. I've often walked in on a first year associate on the other side in a motion hearing, and just taken over, giving the judge a way and path to rule for me. I get both sides of the argument you are making. I've done my own research on the topic - no matter what the topic is. So know how to present, and be ready to cross and counter. I'm listening. 
I wish I could be progressive in the courtroom. I love technology in the court. I'm open for whatever you want to bring at me, if you can convince me.At the end of the round, I look at who is winning the impacts and which impacts outweigh.Let me know your framework. I have to know what I'm judging, and why. You tell me. 
CounterPlans: It's LD. I don't expect a counterplan. But if you're running one, spend time on it and be thorough. 

Speed: I won't tell you you're going to fast. But I'm old. I want to keep up with your arguments. It's up to you. 

Speaker points: Lose points for Rude. Lose points for incoherence. Small deductions for nerves, umms and the like. 

If you have any other questions, ask me before the round. Debate is supposed to be fun and educational, so speak with conviction and passion. Above all things, be respectful to everyone in the round
