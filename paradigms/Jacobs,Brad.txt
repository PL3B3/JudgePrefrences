I personally do not feel that advocating a policy is smart in ld-- i think the rez is asking a question and the way to answer that question is through philosophical debate or straighforward answering, since the rez does not give an actor i feel that trying to make a policy with the rez is functionally impossible. Although i feel that way if you can convince me that a policy is better i will vote on it. I am pretty straightforward in ld--- i follow my flow just as i would in policy debate if there are offensive args that you can win on tell me what they are and why i should vote on them. I am ok with theory although it is not my favorite i will vote on it if you can articulate why there is abuse happening in this round. Other than that i will pretty much vote on anything as long as you can warrent why you should win it. I am fine with speed like i said before and other than that if you have any questions ask me if you get me as a judge.

I guess if you want to know a bit about my speaker point giving ability it works as follows.

30- probably not going to get unless you are amazing and i really feel nice or something to that effect
29- very good and deserving to be in finals of this tournament or at any national tournament for that matter
28- also good (has above average skills and ability on the line by line)
27- normal i will usually give 27 or 27.5 because i personally feel that if you are an average debater that is where you would follow
26- not so good but i feel fairly sympathetic for you or you just were not a good speaker at all.
25 and below- get out of the activity
