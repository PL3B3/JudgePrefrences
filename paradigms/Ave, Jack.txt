I coach at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, NY. I competed in LD for Okoboji High School (IA) for three years along with Policy at the University of Northern Iowa for a year. I attended the TOC my senior year of high school. 

Overview
 I try to evaluate rounds based whats only on my flow. I am a big advocate against intervention so I want to do as little work as possible for debaters. I am pretty tab so do what you want. Small caveats will be explained further down.

Theory
 Theory is meant to check abuse but I understand the strategic value of to uplayer/preclude/etc. I think it is really problematic when good debaters run theory shells (especially against other less good debaters) as a cheap way to get my ballot when they can clearly win on substance. Also, I believe that offensively worded counter interps don't necessarily need to justify an RVI if the interp is very explicit. I default to counter interps.
Disclosure theory: I am still not the biggest fan of this argument. I don't think this should be a go-to argument against positions you don't want to/can't answer. Unless there is a specific reason why your opponent was abusive by not disclosing a position, I will hold it to a very high standard.

Ks
 I was a K debater in college. I am not well read in super dense high-theory, but I will try my best to follow.

Framework
 I really really like framework debates so please have a cool philosophical discussion.

I give good speaks to nice debaters who execute well. I was never that great at spreading so I don't think it's fair that I punish people because they stutter. Make good arguments, have fun, and try your best.
