  Hey Everyone! I debated for 4 years in High School, and did PF throughout my career. I competed on the circuit starting my freshmen year, and regularly went to Texas locals.

Experience: TFA state qualifier in PF

PF
 I was more of a traditional PF debater, so I'm not as well-versed or receptive to progressive arguments, so avoid abusive arguments and complicated theory. That being said, I'm fine with most arguments as long as you provide clear and reliable evidence, explanations, and impacts. Just remember this is PF, not LD or CX. I will vote strictly on the flow, so be sure to signpost and make your arguments/extensions very clear. Provide me with a weighing mechanism and some parameters as to how I should evaluate the round. If you impact your arguments but don't tell me how to evaluate them or why they matter more than your opponents arguments, it's hard to make a cohesive case for your side. Line-by-line attacks are super helpful and encouraged. As for speaking, a little speed is fine, but absolutely no spreading. Annunciation and clarity are really important, as it's hard to evaluate your side if I can't understand what you are saying.
 
LD
 I have some experience in LD, and I love traditional debate. I like to see a good value/value criterion debate, as I think it is the most interesting and intellectual type of debate. I hate judge intervention, so please do weighing for me and crystalize the round, so I have an easy decision to make. I really like it when debaters do impact calc, because it makes the debate super easy for me to judge. That being said, go for what you think you're best at, and I'll evaluate it.

Misc.
 -Debate is a fun activity, so please keep it fun, and make sure everyone stays safe/comfortable inside the round.
 -Racism/Sexism/Homophobic good arguments will result in an auto-loss for the debater who reads them.
 -Sass is appreciated, rudeness is not.
 -Funny jokes will make me smile, and that sunshine will be reflected in your speaks
