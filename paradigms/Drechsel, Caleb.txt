  Background: LD, PF, and College IPDA experience; present coach and teacher of speech and debate.

Speed: Debate is ultimately about communicating to your audience reasons why they should vote for your case. Articulate well, avoid monotone reading, and your speed can increase however fast you can. If you're in the 250-300 wpm range, I'll probably understand it no problem. 

Paradigms:

LD: Value/Criterion Clash is paramount. Your contentions illustrate your reasoning and articulate impact. If your opponent drops your C3, subpoint F, you'd better SHOW me why that's important to the case. Framework guides my own for the round - meaning you show me how to understand and approach the resolution. LD is not about overloading with evidence, but rather about the affirmative defending the resolution and the negative refuting it. 

PF: Clear framework makes the round easier to judge. Voters are key. The best debaters are those who can identify the key point of clash and exploited the impact in their favor. In this format, contention turns are key. 

CX: Little to no experience judging. I am familiar with stock issues and can follow the string of argumentation, but 350 wpm + inexperience might disappoint you. Disads and K's are welcome, because ultimately I'm listening for you to frame the round in my mind. Don't drop cards and stay consistent. Offensive arguments are stronger than defensive ones.
