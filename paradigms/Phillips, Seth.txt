  CX/LD Paradigm:
I tend to vote as a policy-maker, but traditional Value/Criterion arguments are also fine by me in LD.

I will consider and vote on:
Topicality sometimes (e.g., if clear in-round abuse; over-limiting topic)Inherency sometimes (i.e., if plan is already in status quo, then no reason to vote for Aff)Disadvantages almost always (i.e., if properly weighed against Aff advantages/turns)Kritiks rarely (i.e., if properly weighed; compare worlds). Alt needs to compete. "Reject" isn't sufficient.Counterplans almost always (however, must show solvency for Aff harms and not link to any DAs/other offense against Aff)Solvency/Workability almost always (i.e., a plan that doesn't work, doesn't solve for harms and thus doesn't provide a net benefit)Conditional arguments sometimes (e.g., unless team offering argument argues otherwise, I will assume an unconditional status on all augments offered)Theory sometimes (particularly if there is clear evidence of in-round abuse such as Aff over-limiting topic, etc.)
I most want to see in a debate round a few, well developed, substantive arguments

My view on speed (spreading) is I will flow it, but a speaker should not sacrifice articulation for speed. I have some nerve deafness in my left ear, so please be clear.

Preferences:
Professionalism and civilityStanding CX; look at judge in CXOpen CX ok, but don't use as a crutch (I will doc speaks if it's clear one partner is doing all the heavy lifting)I will disclose/critique after round only if both teams request. I will keep it brief because I write a lot on the ballot for your coach's benefit.

PFD Paradigm:
I believe this event is intending to be judged by a lay person, so I expect a conversational style with an emphasis on persuasion rather than technical debate.
