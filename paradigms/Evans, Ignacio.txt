  I debated for 5 years. I coached in B.U.D.L. and judged for 3year in the BCFL and the BUDL. I am a Towson University debater. I enjoy watching and judging performance debates and clean debates. I believe centric education should be what debates are about. Topicality is a method of the objective game that is fruitless most of the time but could be warranted and impacted. We are intellectuals so we should be responsible for such. Framework is how we frame our work and not anything else. Method debates I welcome . Spread is reckless.
