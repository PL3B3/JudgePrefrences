I will vote on anything if it is extend and explained throughout the round.

1. Topicality- I'm ok with topicality. You don't have to spend all five minutes of the 2NR on T if you're going for it, but you do need to spend the majority of your time there if you want me to vote on it.

2. DA- I like the DA, again need to be explained on every level especially the link and Impact part of the flow.

3. CP- I like agent CPs and conditions CPs. I think advantage counterplans can be strategic be need a little bit more work done on the flow. I enjoy generic theory on the CP.

4. K- If you want to win a K debate in front of me 1. you need to have a well explained story specifically on the link debate, I'd like a specific link and not just the generic Latin America link. I like K's like Cap, security and neolib. Framework can easily go either way.

4. Theory: A necessary evil, in my opinion. I hate judging theory debates, mostly because of the lack of clash and development I’ve seen. When the debate is messy, I typically err negative. I strongly prefer to have theory debates kept separate from the debate proper in terms of flowing.
 
Just some general stuff.

Don't be rude. Debate is supposed to be a fun activity don't ruin that for someone.I'm ok with tag team CX.I don't take prep for flashing, just don't be slow about it.I’ll let you know while you’re speaking if I can’t understand you.





Ask me before the round if you have any questions.
