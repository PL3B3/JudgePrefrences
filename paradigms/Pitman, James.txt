slow down more than you would in front of most judges. Clarity and persuasion are important. You can spread through cards etc, slow down on other things. 

I am more a fan of policy arguments, especially now.

K: Fine with them as long as they are well-explained. K tricks can be executed properly in front of me and the Aff often does not cover these properly. Not a fan of any K that has someone's name as the name. Reps K's are better. Provide clarity and be structured - don't make long overviews.

T: I don't like T, because it often is contrived and teams don't do real impact comparison, but will vote either way. If the Aff is clearly untypical, it's different.

CP: Most are fine, CP's that result in the whole Aff are bad and Aff teams should use theory against them more.

DA: I love them, please read them.

Theory: 2 condo is fine bur debatable, Very low threshold If it's less. Don't make more than 2 perms or it will be problematic.

Also in any debate any dropped argument is a true argument

K Affs: It should relate to this year's topic and the USFG should act. You can have critical advantages. If its a k aff that is clearly not topical then i have a really really really really really low threshold on T

if you drop an off case position as the Aff i will stop flowing you.
