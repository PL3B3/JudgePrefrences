Lincoln-Douglas Debate Judge Paradigm for Teja Vepa

This is my LD paradigm. If you are looking for my Policy Debate Paradigm, you are in the wrong place. Please use this link:

I haven't judged LD since 2011, and I'm not sure what still applies from my old paradigm as the LD community changes its norms rapidly. However, I will be judging more LD debate this year than I have in the past. For now, anything goes.

If you're here to fill out prefs for Loyola, Please know that I am usually a Policy judge, and you're best off reading my policy paradigm for my thoughts on most types of arguments. Any other questions, you can ask me before a round, or email me at Tejavepa[at]gmail.com
