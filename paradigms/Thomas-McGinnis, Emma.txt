  I graduated from high school in 1994 and college in 1998. I did forensics in high school, mostly speech. From 1997-2006 I judged Lincoln Douglas debate regularly on both the local and national circuits. Since then, I have judged only rarely, and usually in novice divisions.

I know how to flow, and I have an open mind about arguments. However, you will need to go slow enough for me to follow you, and I do not know the current norms of the activity. I would be open, for example, to theoretical arguments, but these would have to be explained to me -- the norms about things like "competing interps" or "RVIs" are not something that I am well familiar with (though I do hear a lot of heated conversations on these subjects at home.)

To sum up: Go slow. I will flow. Explain clearly and don't assume that I know the norms.
