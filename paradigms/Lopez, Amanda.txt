  I debated varsity PF and LD on my high school team for two years.
 
KRITIKS- Okay: show impacts for everything!
 
Counterplans/DA- Not a huge fan, but not opposed to them. Make sure you convince me why your counterplan is better, again, show impacts!
 
Theory â€“ should be clear how it is relevant to the substance of the debate.
 
I judge based on how well you show impacts and uphold your values. Why are your arguments better? Why am voting for you?
 
Other:
 
There's a difference between being rude and being assertive- don't be a jerk.
 
Impacts!
