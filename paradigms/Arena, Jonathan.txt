  This is my fourth year judging for Timothy Christian School’s LD Debate Team. I have judged at local, state, and national tournaments throughout the Northeast. 

Theory: It's fine when there is an egregious violation of fairness. Run the theory shell but explain to me why your opponent should lose the round for the violation

Speed: Speed is fine, but if I cannot understand what you are saying, I cannot flow what you are saying. If you don’t see me flowing, you either need to slow down or speak more clearly. Please slow down for taglines, card names, and value structure. If you go as fast as this guy, I will definitely not be able to understand you: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4739528881611043896# Normally everything else is fine.

Criterion/Standard: This in my mind is the most important part of your constructive; clearly link every argument in your case to it, and link all impacts to it. This doesn't mean you can't run weird stuff, just tell me the decision calculus of the round. 

Argumentation and Crystallization: Simply weigh your arguments and link back to the standard! If there is no link back to your standard, it has no weight. Don’t just extend an argument because your opponent dropped it or insufficiently attacked it; tell me analytically why it’s important. I’ll be really impressed if you can link to both value structures given. Advocate something; don’t just tell me why I shouldn’t vote for your opponent. Tell me why I should vote for YOU. Make the reasons why I should vote for you self-evident. Tell me where to flow your arguments, why it matters, and why it makes you wins the debate. Voting issues. Please. Voting issues. 

Kritiks: If you must run a kritik, make sure its specific to this resolution, not just something general that could be run on any resolution. K's of the debater is also fine. 

I also recommend actually listening to my rfd, my handwriting is atrocious.
