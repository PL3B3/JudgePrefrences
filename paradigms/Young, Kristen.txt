  Current Position: Debate Coach at Miami Palmetto Senior High School
Former Debate Experience: None

LD

General Information:
I would like to make it clear to all that debate is a brand new experience for me. Although I have learned quite a bit in the two years I have coached at Miami Palmetto, I have no prior debate experience (I did not debate in high school or college).

Impact:
I am a big supporter of evidence. A round without evidence simply becomes an "I said-they said" "debate" with no relevance or ground. Although I consider this very much to be a value debate, I want to see clearly how you weigh the impacts of the evidence on the values throughout the round.

Voting Issues:
I do like to hear voting issues presented in the final speeches. Although I will do my best to keep a rigorous flow, this helps me out tremendously.

Speed/Speading:
I prefer a "medium speed" delivery--not too fast or slow but just right. :-) And as far as spreading is concerned, the same rule applies--anything super fast I cannot comprehend, especially if you a mumbling through your words. If I can't understand you, I can't put those arguments on my flow which means I will vote you down.

Overall Conduct:
Be respectful of your opponent and honor the established decorum of debate. Do not roll your eyes, cuss, or swear, and do not in any way demean your opponent or the judge during your rounds. If any of these things do happen, I will vote you down solely on principle.
