I debated in LD for Rosemount High School (Rosemount, MN) for four years. I debated on the local Minnesota and sometimes national circuit.

Speed: Any speed is fine as long as you're clear

I will listen to all arguments as long as they are run well. Make sure to have good extensions and a clear weighing mechanism (criterion, burden, etc). I tend to make my decision based on impacts. I love it when debaters are strategic and take risks.

As long as you debate clearly and make a clear story as to why your argument outweighs, then you should be able to win the round. Make sure to be respectful to your opponent and their arguments, make some jokes if you want, and have fun! 

If you have any other questions just ask me before the round.
