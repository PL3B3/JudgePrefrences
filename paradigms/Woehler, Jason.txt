  Coaching LD and extemp since 1990. I've watched the event move, change, progress and evolve. I appreciate a debater whose strategy is obvious, evident and intelligent. I have no issue with speed, as long as it is combined with clarity. My general rule is that I'm not there to connect your dots; connect them for me. Tell me why you win, with good, solid and accurate voting issues.
