In terms of Lincoln Douglas Debate I do not like speed although I can and will flow it at a moderate level. If you choose to go at a rate I cannot understand, so be it, I just will not know what your saying. Furthermore, I feel that the standards debate is of utmost importance. I also feel that arguments are not just pieces of evidence but are logical assertions with supporting evidence. Everything must of course be impacted to have any real weight in a round. I am not a fan of Ks, Theory, or Topicality, however, if it is fitting for the round than I will not have any objection to it or vote it down simply because I do not favor it. Even though the focus of the debate is logic, philosophy, and argumentation I do value delivery in terms of speaker points. How you present an argument is important, although it is not of equal importance to logic, philosophy, and argumentation.

In terms of Congressional Debate, I, of course, care about delivery. Delivery and argument presentation are of great importance in the Congressional world. However, being of a background which involves two different forms of debate, I also strongly value logic. Evidence that does not support a logical assertion and/or is not linked backed to the logical assertion is not an effective means of persuasion. Delivery of arguments, as well as, well structured arguments are what allow Congressional debaters to be persuasive and get the attention of both judges and fellow debaters.

I hope everyone enjoys the tournament and good luck to you all.
