I used to debate for the University of Kentucky. You should not change what you would normally do because I am your judge. If you normally go for politics, do that. If you normally go for a performance, do that. I like line by line, but mostly I like you being clear for tags and cites. Have fun. Don’t be mean to each other, but feel free to be sarcastic. Seriously, if you’re doing anything other than trying to find your comfort zone, you’re overthinking having me in the back of the room. I’d rather adapt to what you’re doing.
Quick theory – consult cp’s are hardly ever a reason to reject the team, and usually bring a smile to my face – as does ayn rand. Teams should probably read a topical plan text.
