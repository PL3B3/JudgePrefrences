  
Background
I debated three years in high school for Kansas City Central (KCC). I now debate for the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). I have been an assistant/college coach through the Urban Debate League of Kansas City. I have had the opportunity to coach all levels of debate including middle school. Teams that I have coached have had national success as well as local. 
Things you should consider when in front of me!!!! 
THIS WILL PROBABLY BE A HUGE FACTOR IN SPEAKER POINTS
You should be suspicious of any judge that says they don’t have a preference in argument. Truth is we all do, but as someone that believes in the educational benefits of debate I am open to listening to anything. Debate is about education, but education becomes lost when you aren’t having fun. Please try to make this experience fun for everyone. 
Arguments and what not
I am a critical debater and enjoy listening to critical debates. I believe that K-Debates allow us to use a different thought process that policy arguments tend to neglect. I do, however, understand that not all debaters are critical and that’s ok too. SO here is what I think about everything else.
Topicality: Great argument for teams who don’t have much to run with. If you are going to go for it make sure you put in the work needed to win it; at the end of the debate show me the abuse. 
Counter Plans: Not really a big fan just because I don’t believe teams do enough work on the net-benefit. If you are going to go for this type of argument be sure to give specific link-impact analysis throughout the debate. There is no need to read 25 cards that all say the same thing. You probably only need the cards from the original shell and maybe an ext of the impact to pull my vote on the CP/Disad strat. 
Politics D/A: Ahh! This is where the policy world loses me. I really don’t like politics debates, but I am in no way closed minded when it comes to them. I just really need the story painted out in bright colors.
