  I was a Policy debater at Torrey Pines HS and I debate for Wake Forest University. I am not familiar with the topic in terms of a philosophical standpoint, but I understand it from the view of a policy debater. Don't use too much jargon involving topic literature without explaining terms. 

Read whatever you want. In highschool I went for policy args the politics disad counterplans and those arguments. In college I've gone for the K in like 80% of my 2nrs I'm a 2N and I've been a 2N for my entire HS career. 
I can keep up with tech, but I prefer to look at debates that are focused on central themes. The TOC is supposed to be the best educational presentation of the entire year, I dont think cheap techy wins are good examples of that. That being said, don't be sloppy. I really appreciate spending my mental energy thinking about arguments instead of searching for them. You want me spending more time thinking about your arguments. I presume all your arguments are horrible until I get time to actually think about them.

Phil: I am not your favourite judge for these debates, but feel free to read these arguments. Focus on explaining the strategic purpose of every argument when explaining why you should win the debate. 

Kritiks: I am familiar with most of the literature. Just be esspecially clear about what your argument is. Using obscure rhetoric isn't helpful when you only have one more speech for you to explain your argument. 

Performance/New Debate: Convince me to make my decision in the way you propose and I will. I appreciate it when the 1AC also serves clearly strategic purposes. 

Theory: Get away from the tech and focus on the big picture. Why is debate better if your norm is adopted. You shouldn't leave your debate careers learning about how to word theory interps. You should enjoy your last debates learning about the skills that you gain from the activity and ways for future generations to maximize their time in debate.
