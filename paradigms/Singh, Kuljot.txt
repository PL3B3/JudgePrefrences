  I am a moderately experienced parent judge. I have watched around 60 LD rounds and judged about 20. The 2011-2012 season is my first judging varsity. That being said, I'm more or less open to any arguments if they are explained/warranted well. However, that does not mean that I will be able to follow the complex structure of K's and other Kritical types of debate and I'm more or less a novice when it comes to theory. Honestly, theory strikes me as organized whining. If you truly believe that your opponent is being abusive then by all means, run theory. I will try to objectively judge it, but you must run it well and you must explain it well. I'm not going to vote off of something that I do not understand. In terms of WPMs I can understand around 280-300WPMs and If I feel that you are going to fast I'll ask you to slow down by saying "Clear" or something of that sort. If you have any questions before the round, please ask them and I will try my best to answer them appropriately.
