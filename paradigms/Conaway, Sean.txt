  I have been involved with debate since 1995, having participated in Lincoln-Douglas in high school and parliamentary in college.
For the last four years, I have coached and judged debate in Wyoming across both the Wind River and Hole in the Wall NSDA districts. In my tenure as coach, I have accompanied my team to tournaments at Harvard and UC Berkeley.
Debate is an educational and communication event. I want to witness a debate - one in which both sides are allowed ground. I do not want to see individuals dust off the same briefs that they have carried from resolution to resolution that lead away from topicality. Value-value clash is important to me as a weighing mechanism in the round.
