I debated a total of 3 years in high school on the national circuit and qualled to the TOC's for Policy Debate with my fabulous partner Heaven Montague #YAY
I know how frustrating it can be to have a judge in the back of the room that doesn't understand the literature you read or blatantly ignore the lit of your preference, with that, I will try to be as impartial of a judge as possible. I used to go for 1 off Nihilism (Warren) every neg round my senior year. I won't get into the nitty gritty of my personal preferences nor vent, just do you. I can flow, I won't vote you down because you run FW. I realize different arguments work for different people, so you shouldn't change your arguing style in front of specific judges. This isn't to say you shouldn't learn adaptability, but it's counter productive to totally skew your arguing style because a judge doesn't believe in survival pedagogy and thinks procedural fairness w no extension or warrants somehow o/w's... 

Please be clear, win the flow, I like a good impact calc here and there, convince me somehow that what you're saying is real. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
