  When debaters ask me the question, "What's your paradigm?" I usually answer with the response, "Do whatever you feel will give you the best chance to win the round." I want debaters to debate in the manner that they are most comfortable with. As the judge, I should be the one doing the adapting. As long as you are not ridiculously offensive, there is no particular approach or style that I will never vote for. With that being said, here are a few things that might be helpful to you to know:

-I coach in an area where LD debate is pretty traditional. In our area it is vary rare for people to run kritiks, theory, or counterplans in LD. I honestly do not have a lot of knowledge of the literature often used in these approaches. If this is the approach you want to take make sure that you explain the arguments in a way that is easy for me to understand. I am open to new ideas, but if I can't understand them it will be hard to vote for you.

-I prefer debaters to use a value and criterion, but again that's up to you. I find frameworks to be helpful in weighing arguments throughout the round. I like it when debaters write the ballot for me. Please do not make me intervene in the round. Weigh and impact throughout the round. 

-I am flexible on speed. I will take a detailed flow, but if you go too fast I may miss arguments. Again it's hard to vote for something that I didn't catch on the flow. 

If you have other questions just ask.
