Background: I debated for Hopkins in Minnesota for four years then coached at Annie Wright in Tacoma for three. I've judged plenty of every kind of LD round, locally and nationally.

Since then I've been out of the game for a while. if you're reading this before UPS in 2016, I haven't watched a debate round in a couple years. I don't think my memory has eroded too much, but don't expect me to be up on whatever the new cool thing is.

Here's answers to the most common questions:

You can talk fast. I'm rusty at flowing. Signpost well, please.
You can use a computer and flash drives and all that.
I don't care about how your case is structured.
Theory is fine, but unnecessary theory is unimpressive.
Good arguments are better than bad arguments. Hidden arguments are unimpressive.
