Teacher at Wallenberg Traditional in San Francisco

I competed in policy debate in the 90's during high school. I am familiar with core elements of debate such as DA's, CP's,Case debate, etc. I am making myself familiar with K debate on the neg, but haven't really worked on K debate on the aff.

Speed: Speaking fast is ok, but I need to be able to understand you. Take it down a notch. Clarity is superior to Quick. I will wave my hand if its too fast or not clear. 

Framework: I am fine with Kritiks; sometimes they are even more interesting. I am not well read on this part of debate. personal politics can be convincing. I haven't really heard varsity debates this year so I am not sure how I feel about the aff not reading a plan text; I'm at least open, but unfamiliar with this type of debate.
