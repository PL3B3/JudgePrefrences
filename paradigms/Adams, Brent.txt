  Event:PF

I am a lawyer, former state official, and teacher/coach. My M.S. is in Rhetoric. I place a high value on the public forum element of public forum: oratory, inflection, clarity, rate, professionalism. But, I also flow and occasionally give low point wins. I have low tolerance for rudeness or gamesmanship, e.g., abusive carding, shenanigans with timers, loud conversations during an opponent's speech, etc.

I appreciate a lively -- even heated -- cross-fire, so long as it is about substance.

In high school (Oklahoma) and college (Northwestern), I competed in extemp (NFL Nationals), OO, and LD.
