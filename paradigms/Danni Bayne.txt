  I debated for Lakeville a while back, and have been judging for them for at least 10 years. I like an organized debate and absolutely hate when either debater is disrespectful or rude. 
Speed: I am good with speed, but if you go at top speed, you will need to enunciate and highlight tags. I prefer moderate speed.Choosing a winner: I will look to Voters and other "big" arguments in the round. I want debaters to impact clearly and concisely to their standards and the resolution. Debaters should use evidence, but make sure to impact it back to the argument you are trying to make.Preferred arguments: I like clash. So while it is fine (and perfectly valid) to argue that an opponent's point is "non-topical", "non-specific", or invalid for one reason or another, it is still a good idea to address the argument itself."Theory" arguments: AKA arguments about fairness or about the logistics of debate itself. Unless your opponent is truly being abusive in some aspect of their case (which I will notice anyway), please leave the meta-debating at the door.Last two rebuttals: Neg should be able to cover the entire flow while giving voters. These can be given along the way or highlighted at the end. Aff should focus on directly refuting their opponent's voters and giving their own. While it is possible to cover the flow in the final Aff rebuttal, it is very difficult to do well and you are better served by focusing on the key issues.
