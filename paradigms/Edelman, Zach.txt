  I debated for Scarsdale

Some general comments:
-Don't be a douche, unless you're also funny
-Don't think I won't notice when you say your evidence is great even when it sucks
-I believe debate is a game and I like games
-I could care less if your opponent discloses
-I could care less about your rep
-Don't act like skeptical arguments are below you. They are AWESOME
-Don't argue with me after I give my decision. I will probably make some wrong decisions but I am stubborn enough that I will never admit it and will blame it on you not conveying your arguments clearly enough. Then again I believe that it is your job to make it very apparent where you are trying to win. Probably not a good idea to spend :30 in your final speech on that...

-If you debate paperless you need to have your stuff available on a flash drive AND have a paper copy available if you aren't willing to let your opponent have your laptop during their prep and speech. If you use your paperless debate as a way of stealing prep, I will hate you. No one is above killing a few trees. Unless you are running a K on this... that could be cool.


Theory: (tl;dr If you make arguments about how your opponent is ruining debate, that's all the more reason I'll vote for them)
-If your theory arg is BS you better hope your opponent really sucks
-That said, strategic theory is strategic
-You can't just make up voters and pretend like they are a thing
-Make arguments for reasonability or competing interpretations
-Make arguments about whether theory is a reason to drop the debater or the arg, also not my job to figure out
-I am heavily inclined to buy RVIs

Speaker points:
-Based on how much I like you, which is largely arbitrary
-If you ask me before the round "how to get a 30" I will give you a 26 at the highest

Speed:
-If you ask me before the round if "speed is ok" I will also give you a 26 at the highest
-For the love of God, be clear. I will yell clear.
-I will call evidence

CX:
-I'll probably only pay a ton of attention if you're being funny
-Don't lie
