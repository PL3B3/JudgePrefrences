  I am a “mommy judge” with a background in traditional Lincoln Douglas debate. I only recently started judging on the local circuit and am not familiar with all the terms so I’ll need competitors to crystalize the round clearly. 
LD is a value-based debate so that is what I will weight first in the round. I expect each debater to be informed about the resolution and present philosophical and logical reasoning behind each of his or her cards. Anyone can read evidence- show me how it applies and why I should weight it. Also, make sure it links back to the value and value criterion. 
 If you are going to run a disad or counterplan, make sure I as well as the other competitor can understand it. The purpose of debate is to encourage educational discourse and I expect your case to be geared toward this goal rather than toward confusing your opponent. No spreading and no kritiks.
