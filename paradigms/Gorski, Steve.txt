  I believe that organization is key for a good debate; it allows you to pull ahead in argumentation and find where your opponent has lacked arguments. It is always important to link the case back to the top half of the flow (value) and to stay within the bounds of the resolution. I like new and creative ideas but only if you can make them work within a round. Speed can and will be an issue for me- If I cannot understand you, it is more likely than not your arguments mean nothing to me and will have no weight in the round.
