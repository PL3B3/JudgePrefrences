  MVLA '17

Debated on circuit for a couple of years, now at Columbia. 

Conflicts: MVLA

Haven’t debated or judged circuit in year and a half Will hack for Kant/friv theory/anyone who brings me bbq lays Please don’t be a douchebag
TLDR; I can evaluate a round as long as it’s not super techy but you don’t want me in elims/bubble.
