  Hi! I debated at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in high school (2007-2011) and now help coach there. 

I am tabula rasa. I'm lazy, so I hate to read evidence. Slow down on tags and know I have no background knowledge on this topic. I.e. What is space? What is gravity? 

Topicality: I default to competing interpretations, but am sympathetic to a reasonability framework that is explained. 

DA: I default offense-defense. Politics is difficult for me, so explain who the relevant politicians are.

K: <3 (Floating PIKs should die.)

 I hate the cap K. If you're running cap, and don't know when capitalism existed, you don't deserve more than a 27.5 in speaks. If you can't define capitalism or give the wrong definition, no more than a 27. Capitalism is not god. Don't you dare say it's the root cause of slavery, war, or global warming. 

Any questions? Default to Yao Yao Chen's philosophy.
