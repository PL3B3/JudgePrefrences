  I am judging for Harrison High School in New York, and am a trained newcomer.
  
I am a VERY TRADITIONAL judge. I will flow what I can, but you will need to speak as slowly as possible. 

Please signpost.
 Please speak slowly and clearly.
 The better the speaker, the better I understand.
 Please time yourselves.
 
I will vote for the debater who persuades me more. You should not pref me unless you are highly persuasive.
