  Debated at KSU for 5 years, now I coach at UNT.

Framework – I am probably more receptive to these arguments than you think I might be. I am willing to listen, though I am likely edging toward allowing K type affs. That said if you read a K aff and you do not do the work to win your reasons why the debate should not be under a “policy” framework I am definitely willing to vote against you. 

T – Good T debates are fun, bad T debates are painful.

Theory – I am extremely unlikely to vote on these arguments. For me rejecting the arguments makes a lot more sense and under almost every circumstance I will default to this.

Kritiks – I am fairly well read and like philosophical consistency. I attempt to remove my biases about consistency of theories and listen to the arguments as they are presented.

DAs – Read'em if you got em. 

CP’s – See DA section.
