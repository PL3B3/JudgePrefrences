As everyone says, debate what you’re good at.

The following are just general predispositions; you can persuade me otherwise.

Topicality – both teams should have an interpretation. I’ll vote for the one that creates the best debate for both sides.

Disads – disad + case or disad + counterplan are my favorite debates to watch.
I think the aff can win that there’s almost no link to a really stupid disad.

CPs – I love well-researched counterplans with specific and comparative solvency evidence.
 Process CPs are probably not competitive.
Theory – slow down, be clear, and impact your arguments. I tend to be neg-leaning on conditionality and PICs.

Ks – I probably have a higher threshold for voting on Ks than most judges. The more specific your K is to the aff, the greater the chance that I’ll vote for you. Explain the alt and don’t forget to talk about the aff.

Cross-x is important. So is smart evidence and impact comparison.
You should also keep in mind that I’ve judged few rounds on this topic.
