  I'm fine with moderate spreading and will say clear or slow if you are going too fast or are unclear. Please signpost and slow down for citations.
Speaks: I will give tenth-points, here is a general guideline of what I will give you - 30 - fantastic speech, you were efficient and did plenty of weighing, your ballot story was very clear. 29 - plenty of weighing but there is room for increased efficiency and clarity. 28 - you didn't do much weighing, but your strategy was mainly effective. 27 - you did almost no weighing, I am confused as to where to vote after your last speech.
I prefer when debaters do enough weighing and properly compare warrants for conflicting claims. This does not only refer to weighing util impacts, but also which layers come first and which arguments are the most important. Extensions are key, a dropped argument is a true argument if and only if its claim, warrant, and impact are extended. I will have nowhere to vote unless a framework and links to that framework are extended in full.
Also, I prefer topical arguments, and will gut check theory interps and violations when theory is used as a way to win rather than a tool against abuse.
