I debated at GBS and Northwestern, having graduated two years ago. I have not judged on this topic (but in colleged judged fairly often), which means that for complex, technical, or non intuitive arguments, I need more background. For Topicality, I do not have a sense of how small or large the topic is or what the scope of renewable policy should be. So on these issues, the quality of the arguments will likely matter more than the number.

Regarding theory, I have found the quality of the debate to be much better with the liberal use of evidence to establish common propositions such as education, the possibility of an infinite number of PICs, etc. Whether we should look at policy on the ground or from a bird's eye view changes by the issue and evidence helps establish that. I do not really have an concrete opinion either way on conditionality.

A couple insights into how I assess debates
1) Impacts matter a lot and generally, shape which order I look at things. If a small risk of a big impact matters more than a large risk of a smaller impact, then the issue to me is whether there is that small risk because if there is, then the smaller impact doesn't matter (as much). This said, I find just reading a lot of the same impact cards redundant. Time is better spent reading comparative impact cards which go much farther for the above reason. One impact with a lot of great comparison trumps many impacts with little to none. This is not just how I think about DAs and advantages but also kritiks, theory, etc.
2) Quality of evidence generally trumps spin. And qualifications are drastically underused (e.g., what a professor has to say about an issue deserves much more credit than any student note).
