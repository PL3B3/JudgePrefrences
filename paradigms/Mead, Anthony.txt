  I debated for three years in high school on both national and Ohio circuit, i'm fine with speed, any style of debate, and have judged around 30 rounds this year. I judge for Perry now and welcome any pre-round specific questions. If you impact it, i'll be willing to vote on it if you win it.

Topicality and Theory: I have a much higher threshold for than some judges, but it mainly stems from hearing fairness and predictability tag line extended. Just because a team drops or butchers a speech doesn't mean its an easy win if you still don't impact your arguments. 

CP/DA: Hearing good analysis of internal link/solvency mechanisms and DA/PIC debates are great, as a 2N I love interesting and cohesive neg strategy.

K: I love them as long as you know more than an author name and code word. I really love shenanigans, as long as you are not just trolling. To that I say, "Go back to your bridge troll".

Else use your youngling, padawan, or jedi mind tricks to persuade me.
