4 years Judging High School Debate

I can follow fast debate, but stress clarity, especially the tag line and warrants of a piece of evidence.

I am partial to topicality arguments so long as you do the work on standards and voters. I believe this is a good neg tool to check off topic affs.

DAs- I like impact turns and calculus. Trying to non-unique a DA is rarely enough to sway me.

K's- I have a fairly high threshold for these arguments, but you shouldn't assume that I'm familiar with the literature you've read. Avoid jargon, and spend time relating your argument to the aff.

Framework- A clear framework is necessary to evaluate any argument, you would do well to establish and argue for impact evaluation through your framework.

I am not easily offended and will not dock you for presenting certain arguments, but be respectful of everyone involved in the round.
