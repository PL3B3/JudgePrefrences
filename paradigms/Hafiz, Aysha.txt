  I debated for Newtown (CT) for 4 years and graduated in 2017. I currently attend the University of Chicago.

General
The round is ultimately up to the debaters, and I’m open to listening to any strategies/positions as long as they aren’t blatantly racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. or threaten your opponent. Read whatever you would like or are comfortable with, just be nice to one another :)
I will evaluate all arguments based on the flow, and thus would prefer not to evaluate embedded clash unless there isn’t any explicit clash on the flow. 

Defaults
I default truth testing, competing interps, drop the debater, and no RVI. However, please justify these in round, I would prefer to vote on arguments actually made by the debaters.

Speaker Points
I always liked judges that gave good speaks, so I’ll try not to be too harsh. Generally I will try to reward you as much as possible.
Slowing down for tags/interpretations/advocacy texts is a good idea.
Don’t take too long to flash.
Be efficient, and make the round clean and easy to resolve (overviews are super helpful). 


Good luck and have fun!
