College Speech at Claremont McKenna College 2004-2008

I do my best to decide the debate based on the criteria offed by the debaters during the round.

I will try to decide whether or not the proposition has made a case endorsing the motion for debate. I judge the opposition on their ability to make arguments about why the proposition's arguments are inadequate, dangerous or otherwise misguided.

I then weigh the merits of these arguments, as well as both sides responses.

To help me do this, I appreciate logical organization, clear communication, and clash between the sides. Debaters should carry their strongest points through the course of the debate, and emphasize those they feel are most important to a final decision. Speed and multitude of arguments should not come at the expense of clarity or emphasis.
