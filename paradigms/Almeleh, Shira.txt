  I debated for the Baccalaureate School for Global Education for 3 years, and competed nationally.
I was a really k heavy debater, so I am more familiar with critical literature than anything else. I haven't judged this year, so I'm not very familiar with the literature on the resolution. This just means you should be very clear on the tags and acronyms, and I'll be able to follow.
Critical affs are cool too, but I'd prefer they engage the topic or its underlying assumptions on some level. Those debates rely very heavily on framework, and it will take more than one piece of old evidence cross applied all over the flow to convince me.
That said, I love a good K debate, but I hate when it devolves into a meaningless impact story. Make the links and internal links clear.


I have certainly voted on other types of arguments. I like a good disad/ counterplan debate. I think there are very few theory arguments that are worth the time spent arguing them, and generally don't give them much weight unless it's clear that something is really abusive.
I also really like a good T debate. I value the importance of the discussion created when the debate is about the scope of the topic. I buy the educational impacts of topicality debates if they're made well.

I'm a pretty open judge, and while I may understand some arguments more easily than others, I can be persuaded to vote on almost anything.
