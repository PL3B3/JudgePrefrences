Lincoln-Douglas Paradigm
 
Essentially, I will vote based on however you debate. If you want to make the debate about framework, I will vote on who won the framework. If you want to take the debate down to contention level, I will vote on who won the contentions with the most weight.

The only thing I will NOT vote on in Lincoln-Douglas debate is the kritik.

Policy (CX) Debate
 
I am primarily a stock-issues judge and I believe the Negative only has to win one stock issue to win the round.

Topicality
 I will vote on topicality if the Negative has legitimate reasons for running it.

Disadvantages
 I will vote on a disadvantage if it outweighs case. I recommend that you distinctly outline your impacts to make absolute certain that I understand what you want me to know.

Speed
 On a scale of 1-10, I am probably sitting at about a 2. I like a slow, deliberate pace, and slower than conversational speed is a safe bet with me in the back.

Tag-Team CX
 I do not approve of Tag-Team CX, but it won't lose you the round.

Kritiks
 The only kritiks I will listen to are real-world (I.E. Speed).

Performance
 I have never heard a performance case, so you may want to be wary before running it.

Miscellaneous
 I am open to answering any questions before the round, so don't be afraid to ask.
