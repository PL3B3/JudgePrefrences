In the LD area, I prefer clarity and direct engagement of the opponent's arguments over speed and quantity. IMHO, debates are generally won or lost on rebuttal and, to a lesser extent, cross. I'd rather have you fully address a lesser number of arguments than try to check off a number of boxes by racing through every conceivable argument as fast as humanly possible.
