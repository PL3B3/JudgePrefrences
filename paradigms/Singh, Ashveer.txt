  Singh, Ashveer - LD

Head coach at Marquette University High School in Milwaukee, WI and former PF debater at Brookfield East High School (class of 2014) in Brookfield, WI. 

While my background is in traditional debate, I’m open to pretty much anything as a judge. All I ask is that you extend your arguments, outweigh on impacts and give solid links if you plan on running any Ks and/or Ts so I don’t have to intervene. 

As far as spreading goes, I’m personally not a fan but won’t count it against you in round unless I simply don’t understand what you’re saying. I’ll yell “slow” if you’re going too fast but not more than twice- after that I’ll be tanking speaks. Just for your awareness.
