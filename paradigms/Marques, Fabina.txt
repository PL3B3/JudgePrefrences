  I have been judging for boca high for 3 years, mostly in LD. Because of this I am familiar with most frameworks and basic CP debate. I am NOT however comfortable with spreading, Ks, theory/T, or abstract philosophy. If you do spread I wonâ€™t be able to keep up and will stop flowing to make that clear to you. You can basically consider me a normal lay judge with the main difference being that I will flow.
