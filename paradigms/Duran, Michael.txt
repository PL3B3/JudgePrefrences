  It seems that credentials are in order so here goes. I debated what
is called policy now at Claremont H.S. in Claremont CA my Senior year.
Our team spread and we got pretty good at it.

I competed in Exemp and Impromtu my first two years of college and did well.

I judged while in law school but did not start judging on a regular
basis until 08-09.

I have been a trial lawyer since 1986 and still am. My work and my IE
expereince contribute to the following strong preferences: 1) I do
not like to have debaters spread and if you do, it will cost you
speaks. Ten lousy arguments are not better than two or three great
ones. I want to understand you and your arguments. I want to
understand your evidence, if any, and why it is as good if not better
than your opponents; 2) Your job is to persuade me so presentation is
important; 3) If you have a topicality argument, please state it and
then move on. Endless hair splitting and abuse charges do not make
for great debate; 4) I understand this is a competitive activity but
there is no excuse for bad manners. Courtesy costs nothing and in the
real world is an essential.

I find extending arguments from the AC and NC to be more persuasive
than merely repeating your tags in rebuttal. I can and do flow. So
long as it is fairly done, the better you are at this the better you
will do in the round.

I enjoy the clash of minds and wills that debate represents. I look
forward to seeing some great debating.
