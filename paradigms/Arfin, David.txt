  Style: I find the most educational part of debate to be persuasion, and do not appreciate speed. I find the debater who did the better debating to be the one who successfully won the most important issue for determining whether or not the resolution is a good thing, not one who extended some blippy spike. This also means I find cross-ex to be an important part of the round, since it is the only direct clash between you and your opponent.
Content: I like voting off the value and criterion. I think this structure developed in LD for a reason, and I want to see clear impacts back to the criterion. A good crystallization is critical, and you need to do a good job articulating which arguments you are winning and weighing them against your opponentâ€™s arguments.
