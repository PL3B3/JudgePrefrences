I am a recently-trained Lincoln-Douglas Debate judge. I prefer slow and clear delivery with an emphasis on the value debate. Your ability to communicate arguments effectively is very important to me. I base my decision on how the contention-level arguments interact with the value debate; thus, it is important to weigh arguments and crystallize in final rebuttal speeches.
