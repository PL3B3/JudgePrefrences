  My history: 4 years policy debate in high school, 2 years debate consulting in undergrad (LD and policy), 1 year of nothing debate related. Studied philosophy and politics in undergrad. Coach PF as a volunteer now.

Speed: I've been out of the game for a solid year, and my judging was sporadic in the 2 years prior to that. I'll do my best, but if you go really fast I can't promise it'll all make the flow. Talk to me before the round if you're at all concerned about speed being an issue. 

Arguments: make pretty much any argument, and as long as it's well warranted and you explain it well, you'll do fine. 

In CX I was raised "stock issues" and learned policy style later, so I get those. No problem with kritikal or more progressive arguments, but be aware that I have less exposure to them than stock/policy arguments. 

Regarding LD, I learned LD in a progressive area while studying philosophy--anything goes. Just warrant and explain as appropriate. 

How to win the round: I'm looking for the easiest and most sensible way to vote. Tie up the important argument(s) of the round into a convenient package for my RFD, and you'll be in good shape. The more I have to think when the round is over, the more likely I am to draw my own biases into the round. Since my biases don't reflect your debating, that's not good for anyone. You do the debating so I don't have to.
