  I've done CX in HS and I compete in circuit parli at Cal. I don't like to intervene so tell me what I should vote on and how each sheet interacts with other sheets in the round (i.e. if you're running a kritik with the same impacts as the case at least tell me why the kritik comes first and o/w, etc.). There is one exception to that rule, I'll never vote for potential abuse. Impact calc and thorough analysis at the end of the round is really important. I like theory, but I also love a great CP with a substantial net benefit. T is something I've voted on in the past, I don't generally think it is a reason for an RVI so just save it for another page. Keep the round clean and I'll generally give good speaks (usually 27-29). If you're going fast please be clear. One of my biggest pet peeves is mumbling in debate rounds, the second is being super rude without having a reason to be. Debate is fun and about learning, don't ruin your opportunity or your opponent's opportunity to learn something and have a good time.

Give me real clash and know that I won't c/a or extend arguments for you, you have to do the work yourself.

I don't like performance debate, be it on the aff or with a ridiculous alternative. I'll buy framework over performance.

If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them for you at the beginning of the round.
