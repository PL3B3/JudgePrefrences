  This is my first tournament on this topic. I have judge debate for 6 years. I debated in college and high school at UNT and Caddo Magnet respectively.

Topicality- I do not think that the affirmative must win “offense” in order to win. Reasonability is best proven with examples of possible cases and evidence that the case is supported by a predictable amount of literature in the topic area.  
 
CP competition- I tend to  give the negative a lot of leeway here. I will certainly vote for consult or delay CPs. In order for the affirmative to win on theory, they need to invest a good amount of time in 1ar covering every argument and impacting the voting issue. Arguments tailored to the specific CP the neg is running in the round go a long way, for example, a conditional PIC being worse than just a conditional CP or just a PIC.
