  I did four years of policy debate at Lynbrook HS from 2012-2016. I haven't debated since then and I don't judge often, so please slow down on taglines and make them clear. I don't have any experience with the current topic, so explain any terminology you use.

I'm open to any argument you want to make (provided that it's not offensive) and I'll try my best to evaluate it fairly. I was more policy-oriented, so if you run a nuanced critical position, please explain it thoroughly. If I look confused, chances are that you're not going to like the round results. 

General things: please slow down on tags/theory and do lots of impact calculus. If you have any specific questions, I'd be happy to answer them before the round.
