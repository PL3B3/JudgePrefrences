  I debated policy for four years at St. John's in Houston, TX (2001-2005) and for four more years at UT-Austin (2005-2009). I know absolutely nothing about this year's space topic, so avoid uncommon acronyms and don't assume I have much background knowledge. I'll vote on any pretty much any argument or position as long as it is explained well. Topicality, theory, politics, kritiks - they're all good. I don't like to hear debaters read nothing but blocks in the rebuttals and thereby avoid clash. If you have any questions feel free to ask me before the round.
