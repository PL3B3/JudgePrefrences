  I have experience w/ Policy. I have been in and out of the world for a while now. I am more of a league debater than circuit. I prefer to see clash and I want to hear the reason why I should vote for you. Whether it's the impact, the warrants in your cards or the full ground of abuse. I will entertain any type of argument but just because they "dropped" it is only half of the job. You need to extend the reasons why you pick up the dropped argument. 

Here's some tips on how to score extra speaking points.
1. I want you to sign post your arguments. It results in a cleaner flow and an easier job on my part. Anything to make my job easy is a big plus.
2. Flush out the arguments. Don't just extend stuff, tell me why you're extending it and why your extension out weighs your opponents.
3. Be very respectful to your opponents and your partner. Having bickering or smack down comments is just a waste of time and hinders future debate participation.
4. If your thoughts can't flow as fast as your spreading, I want you to slow down. I'd rather hear a full 8 minute speech than a 4 minute speech with 4 minutes of trying to get the words out.
5. If you're giving me a road map, stick to it. I'm tired of spending 2 minutes sorting out your road map and within the first 30 seconds, it's out the window.
