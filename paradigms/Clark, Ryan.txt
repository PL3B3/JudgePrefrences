  I realize how wanky it is to say one is Tabula Rosa, but it is the closest paradigm that makes sense for me. I coached debate for a long time, and one of my very largest pet peeves, were judges either filling in the blanks, or completing arguments for competitors. I don't do that. We all have ideas in our own heads about what we want in a debate, or what we see as valid.... but I value this activity as a mental sparring match between two high school competitors.... not between them and myself. 

As far as the new technology {thumb drives, jump drives, zip drives, laptops....} I guess this evolution was inevitable, but in a way it makes me sad. Of course, this is not something to throw my vote one way or the other, it is simply to say - if you choose to use tech. it should certainly make the round FASTER - not vice versa.... so yes, it takes PREP TIME.

As far as speed.... I think of LD as the eloquent debate, the presidential debate, the oratorical debate.... so I can handle speed, but prefer it to stay in the realm of c/x instead of LD. Again, not a major voting issue, it is just a preference.

LD is VALUE debate so obviously the value / criterion link is important. Don't drop arguments. Don't forget to address points, and expect to be able to simply say "flow that through" and have that work. Addressing each point along the way is an integral part of the game.

Enjoy. I look forward to some great rounds!

Any questions.... just ask away.

Bests.
