  Hello,

My name is Taylor Pasquence. I am currently a debater for Western Connecticut State University and have been for two years. However, that is my only experience.
In terms of arguments I have run pretty much everything, but I do have a soft spot for kritiks. However, please feel free to run whatever makes you happy. The only thing that I'd recommend is run something that makes you passionate and I will thoroughly enjoy watching you debate (aka good speaks). Besides that just make sure there are impacts to every argument you make and we'll have a merry ol' time.

Specific Argument thoughts: 

Topicality
I will vote on topicality if you 1. win how topicality should be evaluated 2. the impacts (fairness and education). However, you must explain!!!!
If you do not provide a way to evaluate topicality i will default to reasonability. 

Disads
Love critical disads and really cannot stand politix, but i will vote if you explain it and put in the work on the link story. 

CP
Go for it, but you need a net benefit.

Presumption
By far one of my favorite arguments for both the aff and neg. If you say it and you warrant it that will most likely have my ballot. 

Theory
Please dont make it your only strategy, but i will vote on a well explained abuse story. I will easily vote on it if you dont answer the voting issues. 

Kritik
I love most of them. My specialties are Gender in IR, Queer theory, and risk calculus, but the alternative must be won or i will vote on a none unique da. Also specific links are crucial. 

FW
Not a huge fan, but i've run it on both sides. 

Performance
DO IT! Use the fact that debate has no rules, but be able to defend it especially as inclusive and accessible. 

Finally, make sure you do impact calculus and use CX to your advantage, but don't be mean!!! =)
