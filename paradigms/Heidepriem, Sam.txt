I'm open to just about anything. You don't need to slow down for me or significantly adapt your arguments. Critical arguments are fine, and I am familiar with most of the authors; that being said, I need these to be at least fairly well-explained, with concrete impact comparisons. I will vote on theoretical arguments, regardless of how small, if they are mishandled. I will usually vote for the team that makes the most persuasive comparative arguments in the final speeches: I appreciate it when debaters emphasize the interactions of their and their opponents' contentions.
