  Background-I debated for Newark Science (now called Science Park) back in the mid to late 80's.
As of this debate year, I am Assistant Coach for Technology H.S. in NJ. Out of the 21 years since I graduated
HS, I have judged on/off for about 15 years for MHL, CFL, NYUDL, JUDL, and NFL...

In terms of preferences, i am very flexible and will vote on almost anything if its convincing enough.
I do enjoy good frameworks (i.e. convince me why one is superior to your opponents) and answering there's first...
and line by line argumentation.
Analysis on K's are also helpful, don't just spit out old philosophies and jargon w/o good interpretations on its relevancy.
and I do believe Counter Plans should be non topical and competitive (call me old fashioned), though if the Aff is sloppy 
enough not to point this out I will not intervene...
I give extra points for creative arguments and good analysis...
Open cx's are fine, as long as your partner isn't completely oblivious to all the questions...
For performance Affs, try to be at least somewhat topical, as you are already getting plenty of leeway in the debate world these days...
Normativity kind of annoys me...if there are multiple theory arguments, please tell me how I should weigh them against one another..


any questions,

Stephen P.
