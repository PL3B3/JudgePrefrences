  Background: I debated in high school at Homewood Flossmoor, and in college at Miami University. I graduated in 2009 with a degree in political science and minors in art history and naval warfare history. My academic research focuses on EU, NATO and Russian security policy.

Philosophy: I like all sorts of debates. Debates are fun and if you're comfortable with running and explaining an argument, then I'm more than happy to listen to it and vote on it. What I really love are good impact debates and good specific CPs and DAs/advantages. Any sort of kritik is fine as long as the team running the argument knows what they're doing. I will definitely scrutinize evidence, and really hold you to what you say is in a card. I actually like good topicality debates, too. Theory, on the other hand, really needs to be debated well if you want me to vote on it. 

What more can I say? Debate's fun and you shouldn't take it too seriously. You should present intelligent, good arguments and have fun doing it.
