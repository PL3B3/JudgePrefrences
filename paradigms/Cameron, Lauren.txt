I'm fine with whatever you want you want to do in front of me. Make your impacts are well extended, clear, and comparative.

T-- For me to pull the trigger on T, impacts need to be v well explained. Contextualization to the round will definitely help. I default to competing interps.

CP-- Need clear competition explained on both sides, especially on the perm.

K-- Clear links and alt. Need the links to be specific to the aff-- will have a problem voting for a generic K with generic links. Also, I want impacts to be comparative here most of all. Impacts should be related to those that the aff is extending and vice versa. That being said-- I really do like the K.

Theory-- Not a huge fan of it. Will definitely pick you up on it though-- same basic standards to win it as T.
