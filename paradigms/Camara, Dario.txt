Paradigm: 
As a judge I am pretty open to anything in terms of unique positions and arguments. However, I prefer that the debater establish a standard and find ways to meet that standard throughout the round, as itâ€™s the easiest way to evaluate the round. Thus, establish a standard and meet it. If the position involves me reading evidence or reading a map, that will not work. I will not call nor read evidence during the round.

I am not against debaters who are fast; however, speed can get in the way of clarity. Speed should also be used for a strategic advantage and not necessarily to show off. Efficient word economy and strategy are preferred in the round. If I miss something due to speed that is on you. I will not yell clear during the round. "Ain't nobody got time for that."

I will not vote on theory unless there is direct and obvious abuse in the round. Otherwise, it rarely make a reason for decision. 

I have been an LD coach for many years and debater in high school myself. I consider myself a pretty consistent and fair judge throughout and have judges many tournament and out rounds including final rounds of the NCFL, NFL and TOC.
