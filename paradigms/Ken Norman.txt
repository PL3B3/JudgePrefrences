Debate judging experience: parent of a fourth-year VLD debater from Princeton High School; I judge at a couple of tournaments each year.

Speed: I can't flow circuit-level speed and pushing that limit won't make me more likely to vote for you. I can flow fast conversational pace. I will let you know if I can't flow you by saying slow or clear, but by then it means I've already missed something.

Theory: I am unfamiliar with theory debates in general and unlikely to be persuaded by theory as a reason to drop the debater. Theoretical reasons for me to drop an argument should be clearly explained, but even then, these are not strategic ways to win my vote.

Kritikal arguments and role of the ballot: I have an extremely high threshold to vote on a kritikal role of the ballot. If I am judging you in an outround, try to give me another reason to vote for you (a reason consistent with traditional paradigms of LD).
