  My background: 
I debated both at Spanish River High School and at the University of Miami and was extensively involved in coaching, tabbing, and judging for the Miami-Dade Urban Debate League. After college I headed to law school at the University of Michigan. I now work at a law firm in New York. 

My stylistic preferences: 
The hallmark of my judging philosophy is flexibility, a quality I found to be lacking in many of those who judged me during high school. A good debater has been coached to be flexible and creative, adapting easily to the idiosyncrasies of his or her opponents or judges. I look forward to accommodating the creativity, individuality, and industry of each debater who brings something different to the table. 

My argumentative preferences: 
I have none. As a debater I relied heavily on critical, performative and narrative content, so if running kritiks is what you like to do, you should feel comfortable doing it in front of me. If topicality, disads or politics are more your speed, you similarly should feel comfortable continuing to do what has made you successful when I am your judge. It is not my place to choose your arguments for you. 

Other comments: 
Cross-examination, when used effectively, is a tremendous opportunity for speakers to enhance their credibility. I reward those who seize this opportunity rather than going through the motions. 

Weighing is a vital skill in debate and in life. Do it. 

I have no problem with speed, but if theory will play prominently in your strategy, you should pay extra care to your pace and clarity on that part of the flow. 

I look forward to answering additional questions you may have about my philosophy.
