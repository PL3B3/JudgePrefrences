  Hi, I am a traditional parent judge. My son does LD for Shrewsbury. Bump will be my second time judging. I am not comfortable with speed and am not caught up with the jargon of debate quite yet but give it time. Feel free to make most arguments, I am biased towards arguments which make sense logically and are smart. Smart in this sense means intellectual and conducive to discussion on the topic, not smart strategically for an easy win. With that said, I do not evaluate nor understand theory but if your opponent is being extremely unfair I will gut check. Feel free to let me know if they are abusive with a word or two on why. I'm capable of understanding complex arguments and you are encouraged to make them but be sure to very clearly explain them and how they make me vote for you. All said however, I am still a new parent judge.
