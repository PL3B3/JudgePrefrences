 Preferences:
 DA’S – My favorite type of debate is a disad vs. case discussion because people (especially novices) understand these arguments more than others so there tend to be more in-depth discussions. I like to resolve questions analytically, which is why impact calculus is very important, it is also important to be making turns case arguments because they can resolve the direction of the impact or internal link. (I hope you get the point – I like analysis and in-depth discussion).
 I’m really fine with any DA, as long as it makes sense and I think it outweighs the other team’s impact – this basically goes with any impact, which is why impact calculus is so important.
  
 K’S – I do not go for the K that often, but that does not mean I will not vote on a K. (The one K I go for and really understand is security) You will need to give me deep analysis of what your K is and how it operates. The way I look at the K on the aff is a bit different, like I think link turning a K is completely a legitimate strategy.
  
 T – I have a medium threshold to vote on T, I think potential abuse is a voter. I think T is a great way to get an understanding of the topic. Also, too many teams don’t take the resolution to into account when picking an aff or strategy, like I know teams that have read the same affs over the past two years (space and TI), so T comes in for situations like those.
  
 Theory – I like theory debates, but they have to go down in a fashion similar to T debates, and that means impacting your standards. At minimum this means that I will reject the argument, and I require analysis on why I need to reject the team.
