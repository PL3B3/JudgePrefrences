  I debated for Lakeville South 2008-2012, both Public Forum and Lincoln Douglas. I currently study Philosophy at Macalester, and have judged for a few years.

LINCOLN DOUGLAS
Paradigm:
I tend towards a paradigm of truth testing:I believe that a debate at its most basic is an argument about truth, and thus the resolution provides the most essential area for clash.What this means for you:Affirmative: Show me that the resolution is true.Negative: Show me that the resolution is false, or that it cannot be true.It is far too often that I see debates lose focus on the resolution. Make sure that I know both what you're saying and why it matters.Proposing a different paradigm is acceptable
That said, I am generally open to any arguments you want to throw at me, and I'd like to think that I am adaptable to different styles of argumentation.

Notes:
Speed: I am comfortable with speed, and I will shout clear if I need to. For your own sake, make sure that authors of cards and signpostings are enunciated distinguished. As a good rule of thumb, watch me, watch my pen, and you'll know if what you're saying is clear.Theory: Sometimes I see theory used well, and sometimes I don't. I will still include anything you say in my decision, so feel free to use it, but know that I will get annoyed if you are using it unnecessarily or excessively.Humor: I strongly encourage humor in any debate round. However, don't be mean.Speaker Points: I average 28. Don't expect less than 27 or higher than 29. The best way to receive a low score is by being disrespectful, so keep it professional.
PUBLIC FORUM
Claim, Warrant, Impact.Don't be mean.
