  I debated for Brentwood high school for 4 years and competed mostly on the national level. I am currently a freshman at Vanderbilt.

I think theory and topicality are the best arguments to read in front of me cause I'll be best at adjudicating that debate, but I don't default to theory coming before the K or it being the most important "prefiat" argument. Default no Rvis, drop debater, competing interps. My default reasonability brightline is competing interps (haha).

I'll vote on Ks obviously but they are always recycled and generic so if u have a good topic specific one or one specific to something the aff/neg said or did in the round then by all means go ahead.

Framework debates are solid debates.

I don't have an offense defense paradigm I pick a framework (not randomly, based on the arguments in the round) and see who is winning stronger links to it.

Plans/Cps/Da's all the util arguments are really solid arguments and doing that well usually shows a solid understanding of the topic literature.

Speed is fine slow down for tags start by being more clear and u can taper off as ur feelin the time crunch.

Ask any questions u want before the round I'll try to average around the high 27's.
