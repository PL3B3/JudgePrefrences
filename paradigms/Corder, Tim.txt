  I am new to Debate but look forward to participating as a Judge. My philosophy is based on an unbiased and open minded outlook when evaluating those individuals competing at the tournaments. There is always "gray area" in every subject that must be considered and to see things only in "black and white" limits one in his perception of events that surround us in everyday life. I will look for those that present the best arguments and can best support their position from either the affirmative or negative perspective. I will focus not just on content but also require that the skill set in both communication and presentation is achieved by the contestants... I will also ensure that the "rules of engagement" are followed to ensure a fair debate.
