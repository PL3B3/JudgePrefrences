Judging Paradigm:

I prefer that debaters attempt to speak as clearly as possible. If a debater becomes unclear on account of speed then I would recommend slowing down. But I have no problem with speed in debates. I hold no pre-dispositions toward any argument. I will vote on whatever the students have articulated the voting issues should be by evaluating the impacts in relation to whatever criterion has been won in the round. If there is some sort of alternate framework or critique I would appreciate an explanation as to why those sorts of arguments ought to come before the criterion or the standard framework for a debate. I will not evaluate any impacts that donâ€™t relate back to the criterion unless the debater wins an argument about why I should.
