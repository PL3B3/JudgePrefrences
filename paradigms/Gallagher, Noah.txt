  Currently a Debater at Lakeville North High School.

I am typically fine with whatever you wanna run. Only thing that really truly bothers me is if debaters are running arguments that their opponent cannot engage in. This means overly dense material (which you should slow down for anyway) or spreading if the other debater is clearly not ok with speed or demanding that responses fit into competing interpretations if the opponent doesn't know how theory works. If I feel this is the case I will tend to be slightly interventionist and have a lower threshold for responses to such strategies. Other than that I try to be tab, but if you don't do the weighing for me then I will try to resolve the round while doing the least work for you. Feel free to ask for any more clarification about specifics pre-round.
