  GENERAL: I'm a student at Harvard; my debate experience is fairly limited.

PREFERENCES: I want to hear a substantive round without illogical impacts. Good links are essential, no matter what the argument is. BE SLOW AND CLEAR when speaking. Don't go for tiny, blippy arguments that I may miss. BIG PICTURE is essential. Tell me how you want me to decide the round, and be as clear as possible.
