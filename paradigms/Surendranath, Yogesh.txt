  Experience/Background:
I debated policy for four years in high school (Northeastern Ohio) between 1998 and 2002. As a college undergraduate, I judged three more years of HS policy debate. I have not seen a single policy round since 2005 and so I am very out of touch with current lingo. I am currently a Professor of Chemistry at MIT.

Philosophy:
I am a tabula rasa judge and prefer not to intervene in any way. Please tell me how to vote or you will be unhappy with my decision. I have no preformed biases against (or for) kritiks, PICs, etc. I will be willing to vote on any argument about which the debate ends up centering. 

I am also okay with speed but please do not slur your speech (I pay attention to the content of your cards - not just the tag line). 

I am perfectly fine with tag team cross-x.
