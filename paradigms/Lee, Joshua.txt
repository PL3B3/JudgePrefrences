Key Takeaways:

1. Run what you run best. I mean it when I say this, because in debate rounds I suspend as many truth claims as I can - if a team cannot defend that patriarchy or racism is bad, that team deserves to lose.

2. I am more flow-oriented, so dropped arguments almost always come first. Please note that I define an "argument" as constituting a claim, warrant, and implication.

3. Although offense-defense paradigm makes sense, you can win on 100% defense.

4. Explaining the implications of an argument wins rounds. The spin controls the way I read evidence.

5. Absent tournament guidelines, my speaker points range from 26 to 30. 27 is the average speaker. 26 is below average, and 28 is considered good. Under the 0.1 scale, 30 establishes that this is the best speech I believe I will see that year, and 29.5+ establishes that I believe you should be in the top 5 speaker of the tournament. Under the 0.5 scale, 30 establishes that I believe you should be in the top 5 speaker of the tournament.
