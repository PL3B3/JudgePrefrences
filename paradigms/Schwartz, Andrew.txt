  I’m a San Francisco State Senior who has 5 years collegiate competition experience and 3 years of experience coaching high school debate. If I am able to I will judge primarily off of impacts. This means to maximize the effectiveness of your arguments you should make the impacts clear to me, and this includes the pathways that tie them to your case. Do not make me assume things for you, I’ll look back to my flow when making my decision and I won’t make logic leaps on it for you. I am fine with any procedurals that you feel like running provided they are well supported and tie into the arguments that have been made. Speed generally isn’t an issue for me but if it looks like I’ve stopped flowing then it means that I’ve likely lost your argument.
