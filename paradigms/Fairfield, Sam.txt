  Assistant Coach at Des Moines Roosevelt. Have judged a few LD tournaments over the last 3 years. I compete in Parli in college and in high school did foreign extemp and public forum. I understand the technical aspects of LD and feel that speed should be minimal in the event, it is not policy. Slurred cases will not help you with me. You are better off developing a few main ideas well than spreading 20 blipped points across the flow. I take a pretty traditional approach to LD debate. I expect clash on the standards, value, criterion. I am open to someone running a K if they run it well and uphold the framework/reps, but prefer more traditional style LD debate. I need a priori voters explained and told why they are a priori in that round. I need to know why a burden for which ever team is a burden in the first place.
