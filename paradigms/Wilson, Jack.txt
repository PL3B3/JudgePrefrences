  I debated for Ridge High School in New Jersey, competing on both the local and national circuits, qualifying to ToC my senior year. I currently study History at Queen's University ('18).


Short
1. Work your way to top speed over first 15 secs of your speech, enunciate card names, I'll say clear, slow, louder, etc. twice before docking speaks.
2. You should run the arguments that make you comfortable, not the arguments that you think I'll like. When I debated I ran mostly Ks my senior year, but that doesn't mean I'm predisposed to vote for those types of arguments. Do what you do best.
3. I think the role of the judge should be defined by the debaters. As such, I will remain as objective as possible through the entire round. I'll leave it up to the debaters to tell me whether to function under a competing worlds, truth testing, ROB/J paradigm, etc. If no arguments are made about framing I'll default to whatever seems to fit the best (i.e., comparative worlds in LARP rounds). 
4. I will vote on any warranted argument as long as it is not sexist, racist, homophobic, colonialist, etc.

Theory
-I will default to reasonability on theory unless told otherwise; on matters of topicality, I'll default to competing interpretations. If you win a good abuse story under a reasonability paradigm you will certainly earn high speaks for yourself. 
-I will assume drop the argument on theory unless argued otherwise and drop the debater on topicality. 
-I will assume all counter-interpretations need an RVI. If a counter-interp is to be offensive, it needs a standard that justifies the offensive plank in the interp.
-I would prefer that paragraph theory in the 1AC have a voter justified in the 1AC as well. 
-If you make new interpretations of tricks that aren't specified in the 1AC, then the neg can respond to those implications, but not the argument itself. 

Other defaults
-Perms are a test of competition on CPs
-Perms against Ks are best with a net benefit
-Skep triggers are inherent to most philosophy, but should be implicated well in the 1AR. 

Debates that will earn you higher speaks:
-Having a well thought out, engaging debate that weighs fairness vs. role of the ballot arguments. I don't want to hear a generic dump, there are so many great nuanced arguments for both sides. 
-Winning some form of skepticism (not as a trigger, but as a position) and making implications that transcend 1AC framework
-Going farther left while responding to critiques (i.e., reading a methodology K against a critical framework, or reading cap as a response to race)
-Topicality debates with carded standards 
-Util cases with systemic, rather than extinction, impacts. 
-Debates that involve Foucault tend to be intellectual stimulating.
-Super cool philosophy debates.
