  I have been a Speech and Debate coach since 2016 and have a background in teaching philosophy and critical theory. I am OK with speed, but not spreading; I prefer clarity. If you're spreading at more than a fast conversational speed, I won't be able to understand you. I do not want to have to read your case at an oral debate tournament.

I do flow (in my own way) and keep track of contentions, but am more of a flay judge, and closer to lay.

I am fine with critical theories, but your critical theory should be an accurate representation of the theory, not a line or two taken out of context to fit your argument. I understand argumentation but not all Speech and Debate terminology and technicalities, so I expect debaters to be able to present their arguments clearly and precisely.
