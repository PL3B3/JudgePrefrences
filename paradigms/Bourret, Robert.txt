  I'm currently a student at Northwestern University and debated Public Forum all four years of high school and attended NDF debate camps in Boston. I'll be judging Congress at Apple Valley so this profile is solely focused on that type of debate.

General Paradigm: If you take a look at the NFL congressional debate judging guide, I think it is fairly clear what most Congress judges want to see. I focus on quality over quantity when it comes to final rankings, meaning that I want your speech to advance the debate and not be a rehash of what has already been discussed. If questions are presented to you, the quality of your answers will affect your score and I tend to reserve 6's for debaters who are able to answer questions extremely well. This is not to say an excellently planned speech cannot earn you a 6, I just want you to showcase your ability to think on your feet. Referencing other's arguments is almost always a must because that is the only way your speech is likely to advance the debate.

Speaking style: I can keep up with speed but really don't want to see spreading in Congress. Make sure your speeches are well organized so you're not rambling at the end.

Evidence: As I said, I was a PF debater so I prefer more than one piece of evidence in a speech. Your arguments need to be backed up by evidence since I really dislike unwarranted claims. Having good evidence shows me you know what you're talking about and you're taking this seriously. Integrating evidence well into your arguments is essential to getting a good score. Furthermore, analyzing your evidence or someone else's in your rebuttal and showing why it's flawed, outweighed etc. is what I want to see.

PO's: Be assertive but not aggressive. Your job is to move the debate along and ensure everyone gets a fair chance to speak. If you're confident with procedure and effective in advancing the session then you'll like earn a high score from me.
