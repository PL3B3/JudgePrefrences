I am a parent judge in my first year judging debate. I really like judging debate locally in Florida. The students who perform are really fun to watch and engaging. I will take notes but they will not be in the traditional flowing manner and cannot handle speed. Approach the resolution in a holistic approach and explain to me WHY you are winning the resolution overall. You must be persuasive in your approach to debating in front of me.
