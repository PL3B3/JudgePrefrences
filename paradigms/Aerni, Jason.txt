  I debated on the national circuit between 2007 and 2010 for Berkeley Carroll. When I was a debater, I tended towards being more conservative and didn't usually run many critical positions or theory, but naturally, I needed to deal with all types of argumentation as I debated, so I'll probably be familiar with anything you throw at me. Just be sure that when you run an argument that it makes logical sense and that if you're running a complex argument or long cards that need deciphering, take time to explain the argument well. Don't assume that I'll understand exactly what your argument is just from reading a card. Make sure you give me a clear mechanism for comparing arguments/tell me why winning your arguments wins you the round. Critical positions are fine, speed is fine. In terms of theory, I recognize that it is necessary in debate in certain circumstances, but as a debater, I always hated when my opponent would run theory for the sake of being abusive and usually a judge can tell if theory is being used abusively. If your opponent is being abusive, I will absolutely listen to your theory and whatever you tell me to do with it. I won't disregard theory because I think it's abusive, but if your plan is to run a lot of theory, recognize that I may be pretty willing to give your opponent the benefit of the doubt if they tell me that your theory is abusive. In general, I value intelligent argumentation. So, in terms of speaker points, I will be more generous if you go through the flow and give smart responses to your opponent's warrants than I will if you get up and read 6 pre-written carded turns. Relax and have fun.
