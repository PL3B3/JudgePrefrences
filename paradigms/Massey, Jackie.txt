  I am the Director of Debate at the University of Oklahoma.
I like all kinds of debate. I have preferences, but I also feel as though my duty will be to judge the debate I have in front of me, rather than a debate I prefer to see in front of me.
You must answer the other teams arguments for it to be a debate. What is the difference between the two teams arguments, if there is one (perm), and why is that important?
I am familiar with all type of arguments. You should debate the way you prefer to debate.

I am not sure if I can draw a false dichotomy between "tech" and "truth". That kinda seems like "might makes right".

Think Big. Not small.

Cross - X is important!

Good Luck!
