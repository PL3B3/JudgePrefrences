  Bill Kemp – Judge Philosophy

I debated in high school a long time ago (before LD even emerged as a debating event), and later on received a graduate degree in public policy. My professional experience as a management consultant has included a good deal of analytical work and public testimony on regulatory and legislative issues.

My judging posture is that of a critical listener. I evaluate which side has presented the most convincing, workable solution to the issue/problem put forward by the resolution, putting myself in the place of an an informed but somewhat skeptical audience. Effectiveness of communication and rhetoric is vital, since body language and speaking style dominate an audience’s impression of a speaker. Speed is only good if clear and effective. Evidence of the workability of the solution in the real world is needed, including such considerations as cost or feasibility. Values are important, but must be germane to the resolution. 

So in terms of the more general categories of judge philosophies, I would fit best into the “policy making” paradigm, with some “skills” flavor thrown in.
