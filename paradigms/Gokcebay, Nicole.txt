General: The educational level and depth of the debate is really important to me. I do not have any biases in terms of arguments. Run what you want, but please please please make sure you explain your arguments. I will not do the analysis for you. Don't read me your coach's blocks and think I will be impressed or persuaded. If you don't understand them, It will be obvious and I will be sad. Oh, and make the round is interesting for me to watch and for you to debate in.


K: I was a K debater in high school. I really love critical arguments, but there is nothing I hate more than if you can't explain them and/or do not understand them. Just because I debated the K doesn't mean that I already understand your arguments so explain them clearly. 

Performance: it is really hit or miss. If you are doing it just to be weird or different and not because you believe in them, I will not appreciate your arguments. 

Speed: I'm okay with it, but if you have awkward breathing habits, I'll get irritated and just ask you to slow down. Clarity is important. I want to minimize judge intervention so make sure you slow down when necessary. 

T/Theory: They weren't my forte in high school, but if you are winning on either then I will not hesitate to vote on it.

CP/DA: What about them? They are persuasive when ran stragically, but really boring and irrelevant when not.


I really hate arrogance and that tends to be a popular trait in many debaters, so be nice and your speaker points will thank you for it.
