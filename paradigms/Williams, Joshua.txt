  I almost vote for any argument

I prefer to hear really good disads

If you're on the neg and you're going for T, actually go for it and dont just run through it. T is a procedural issue and a theory argument to a certain extent which means it requires a far more indepth debate than other policy issues.

DONT RUN A K AND A CP at the same time unless you clarify awesome reasons as to why you are doing so

p.s.
I'll add more later.. if i dont get a chance to just remember the above stuff and if you have questions ask me in the round.
