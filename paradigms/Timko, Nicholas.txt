  I am a Trial Attorney and spend many of my days in a courtroom questioning and cross-
examining witnesses and debating my adversaries before trial or appellate judges.
I don’t mind speed, but if you go too fast you risk losing your best points. Also, I would
rather hear fewer, well-reasoned and supported arguments than a laundry list of every
conceivable argument. Signposting is appreciated.
Rudeness or derogatory remarks about your opponent will cost you! Also, I don’t like
jargon. Using phrases like “if you don’t buy that,” while accepted by debate insiders, suggests you are simply throwing out every argument you have, hoping something will stick. Language is important. The quality of arguments, evidence and presentation will be more effective than a rapid, robotic recitation of standard lines. If it sounds like you don’t believe your own arguments, I probably won’t either.
I look for a purpose in cross examination beyond simply asking the opponent to restate
his/her arguments. It is underutilized by most debaters and a wasted opportunity to control the debate.
I also appreciate a debater’s ability to effectively turn an argument.
The V and VC are important and your arguments should clearly link back. If you want to
use theory, make sure it is justified. Explain why you should win the round and present voting issues.
Finally, as the parent of a debater I appreciate the dedication and effort required to
participate. Have fun and know that any comments I make are offered only to help you improve your skills and succeed in the future.
