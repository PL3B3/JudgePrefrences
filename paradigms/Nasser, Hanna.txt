  I debated for four years in highschool for Whitney Young. I have some experience on this topic; I lead a lab at the Chicago Debate Summer institute and worked on the Core Files for the Chicago Debate League. There aren't many arguments I won't vote on, as in I don't really have a policy/ K paradigm, i'll vote for who ever did the better debating on those issues. I am willing to vote for procedural args (t, theory, framework) if the final rebuttals come down to it, as long as they are treated like every other argument in debate and are clearly impacted.
