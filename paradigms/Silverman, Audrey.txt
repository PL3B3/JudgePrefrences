  As an English teacher AND a debate coach, I do care an awful lot about language use. If a debater makes amazing arguments, but employs bad grammar or weak vocabulary, it does influence me. On the other hand, I am a flow judge who strongly notes unrefuted remarks, though I am convinced by a refutation against the argument, rather than the "card."

Speak clearly, loudly, and emphatically. Do not spread. That's all.
