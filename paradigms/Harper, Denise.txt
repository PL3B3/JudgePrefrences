  Experience:

I have been a high school English teacher for 14 years. I graduated from Arizona State University in 1997 with a degree in secondary education. In 2009, I received my master’s degree in rhetoric and technical writing. This is my second year as a speech and debate coach for Red Mountain High School in Mesa, Arizona. I have judged LD, PFD, and all speech events.

LD Philosophy:

My paradigms are simple:

1. Don’t spread. Talking quickly is fine, but I will be flowing your arguments, so if I miss something, it hurts your cases. I am willing to say “clear.”

2. Be respectful both to me and to your opponent.


Other than that, follow the rules of the NFL and you will be fine. I like to see what you do with an argument, but don’t get so heady in philosophy that you forget the practical applications.

A few musts:

Aff must have a framework

For Neg:

It is suggested that Neg has a framework unless you can completely tear down your opponent’s case without one

Kritiks are acceptable because they do add originality to a round; however, make sure you know how to use them. Just because you present an alternative argument does not mean that you have automatically disproved your opponent’s case.

LISTEN to your opponent’s arguments. Don’t get caught up in some original argument that you have if it doesn't do anything to rebut your opponent’s case.
