  - The lopez counterplan will do some serious damage to your points

- I’m not very good for the counter-factual aff

- The plan is too short to be the exclusive focus of a debate

- The more sweeping the claim, the less persuasive (all of the aff’s knowledge is western, all of their authors are paid off by the military, etc)

- Flippantly labeling small things a VI will hurt your points

- I’m bad for close topicality debates (latin America topic)

- Presumption won’t go towards less change. It will go to whoever made the most sense/whoever demonstrated that they really knew what they were talking about

I wrote this quickly but I’ll try to update this as I think of more proclivities. I promise I’ll give you a fair hearing.
