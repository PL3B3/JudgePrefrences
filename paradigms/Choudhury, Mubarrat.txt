I'm a first-year at the University of Texas at Austin. I debated LD for three years and PF for a year at Richardson High School in Texas. Expect me to have a decent understanding of the topic, give or take a week in. 

Before anything, explicitly sexist, racist, xenophobic, and homophobic discourse does not belong in debate and try to be nice to each other. This is debate, not Mixed Martial Arts.

Speed:
 Go as fast as you want, just slow down on tags and card analysis at the end is preferable. If you go faster than you are clear, I will yell clear once. If you still aren't clear, I'll probably get on Facebook until I can understand you again. I'm vehemently against speaker points so I usually give 29+ to most debaters unless you honestly don't deserve it.

Framework:
 I would like to think that I am a TAB judge, so any metric of evaluation is cool but framework in and of itself isn't a voting issue for me. If you win the ROTB or metric of evaluating the round, it doesn't mean you win the round, you still have to garner some sort of offense on the contention level.

Argument Preference:
 You can literally run anything in front of me and I will evaluate it. Plans, CPs, DAs, Ks, or traditional cases are all cool. However, I do ask, that if there is some dense literature behind an argument, it would be in your best interest to explain it. I will flow whatever I hear and will try my best to understand and evaluate it, but if you aren't helping me out, I won't be sorry if I miss something crucial.

Theory:
 You don't have to have the arguments in the traditional shell, but preferable. I enjoy Theory/T arguments when used for necessity and strategy and really hate them when they aren't, because they get a bit difficult to evaluate them when I don't need to.

Overall:
 Claim, warrant, impact + Weighing arguments+ Debating well = You should win
