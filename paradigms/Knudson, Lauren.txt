  Policy debater for Iowa City West 2011-2015
Swarthmore College class of 2019
K's
I was a policy-oriented debater in high school and therefore have limited knowledge of critical arguments (as they are argued in debate, my knowledge of political philosophy has grown) but that does not mean I will not vote for critical arguments. That being said I will not vote for an argument that I cannot give a coherent RFD on so make sure you explain the argument thoroughly.
Theory
I don't mind a well debated theory debate but will NOT vote for a blippy theory argument that is 30 seconds of the 2AR
Basics:
I try to evaluate the debate with the tech over truth mindset but will not vote on blippy arguments that are not argued out or impacted.
I will only call cards if a piece of evidence is contested by both sides of the debate.
Tag-Team cross-ex is allowed but donâ€™t let it get out of control.
If you are rude to the other team your speaker points will be dropped.
I will only ever vote for one team, speech times will be enforced and I will only flow arguments made by the designated speaker.

For more information see Travis Henderson or Megan Johnson's judge philosophy. As these were the people who taught me to debate so my style will be very similar to theirs.
