To keep this brief: I debated throughout high school, then at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Central Oklahoma, and I’m currently an assistant coach at Chattahoochee. I’m comfortable with all styles of debate, especially those regarding the k – I’m most familiar with poststructural and identity criticisms, though you should do whatever it is you do best – you can just as easily win with a plan, theory, framework, etc – give me your best arguments and write my ballot. I privilege tech over truth and frequently vote for arguments that contravene my personal beliefs. Some things that have frustrated me this season: excessive rudeness (toward opponents or judges), offensive strategies (e.g. ableism inevitable/good), and clipping. Also, I can’t believe I’ve had to add this to my paradigm, but please don’t engage in acts of self-harm to win my ballot. Instead, please demonstrate mastery of persuasion, word economy, and 2nr/2ar vision – teams that reverse-engineer strategies and execute them methodically speech-by-speech impress me the most – a searing cross-ex is, of course, welcome– entertaining and innovative teams will be rewarded with speaker points. A few final notes: not a huge fan of process counterplans (though I’ll still vote for them), conditionality is pretty good (as is neg fiat), and link uniqueness wins rounds.
