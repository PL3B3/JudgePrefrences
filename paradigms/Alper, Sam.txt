  I was a policy debater for three years at the College Preparatory School, and attended the Cal National Debate Institute for three years as well. However I only debated casually, and mainly stuck to local tournaments. As such, I wouldn’t consider myself an expert, but I am familiar with the basics. My flow is only average (and probably slower due to the fact that I’ve been away from debate for so long) so speeding through your speeches will only cause me to miss args. Be as clear as possible.

I’m much more or an issue-oriented judge – kritiks and theory arguments are much less important, and I’d prefer not to see them. Overall I like my debate as clear and simple as possible.
