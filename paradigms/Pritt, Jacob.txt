  Harvard 2016 Update:

What's up y'all. I did debate in high school and was reasonably successful (competed at TOC three times). I graduated in 2012.

1) Don't read anything offensive. If your arguments are racist or sexist, I'll drop you and just stop paying attention to the round.

2) Play your game. I'm interested to see the ways you've come up with to approach the topic.

3) I haven't judged a round since the September/October last year, so I won't be the most up to date, but I think I'll still be able to understand whatever technical things you try to do. I also am not coaching this topic, so don't assume I've read your really stock topic evidence.

4) I'm going to try to be as "tab" as possible. That means I'm going to evaluate any argument you choose to run. Tell me why you're winning.

5) I really like philosophy. Take that as you will. I don't really like counting up the weight of your impacts but will be happy to do so if you're explaining them and weighing them well. I really like theory/T when executed properly. I really like non-traditional plans and counterplans. I really don't like one sentence arguments in the AC (or NC) that blow up into four minute arguments in the next speech. If I didn't flow it, I will not feel comfortable voting on it or excluding large portions of argumentation because of it.

6) Speaks: will be based primarily on your public speaking and communication skills. For that reason, I have no problem giving and frequently do give low point wins. Your strategic decisions will also marginally influence your speaks. So yes, you should probably stand (and make eye contact, and be courteous to your opponent).

Please, please, please ask me any specific questions you have before the round; I will be happy to answer them and discuss any of the things here in my paradigm.
