  I am a parent judge. I like to hear debate about the resolution. Counter plans are okay. I have a background in aerospace engineering and I am conservative, though these won't intentionally change the way i judge-ill listen to any argument. Go slow and explain arguments- I DO evaluate arguments and have a basic understanding of framework. I have little experience with judging, though not none.
