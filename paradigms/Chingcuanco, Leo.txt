  I did 4 years of policy with College Prep (CA). I haven't seen a round in 5+ years, though, so don't expect me to be familiar with the topic, the latest arguments, or this newfangled paper-free system. Argue anything you want. Just know that nobody likes wading through 8 minutes of theory, and I will treat your generic K links very skeptically. Feel free to ask me any questions before the round starts. Good luck!
