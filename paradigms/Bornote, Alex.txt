How to win my ballot:
WEIGH

To win my ballot you should make clear weighing analysis for the round. Tell me the way I should be viewing the round and how my ballot should function. Essentially it is your job to do the work for me.

Speed
I'm fine with it, I can keep up with probably 90% of the fastest speakers, clarity is key though. Please slow down on tag lines, and slow down when explaining certain parts of the case and how they function in the round.

K's: I have a good knowledge on critical philosophy, but please have analytical argument very fleshed out and not just assumed because you read a type of author that the argument that is said is what is assumed.

Theory/Topicality : I consider and vote theory if its legitimate. If its frivolous and its won, i'll give a terrible low point win.
