  Background: I did FX at Cherry Creek HS (CO). Now I'm a Political and Moral Philosophy major in college so I prefer to judge LD.
I'd consider myself a competent judge.

Philosophy:
- Don't spread. That doesn't mean you can't talk fast; just keep it at a reasonable, humane pace. Remember, you're still trying to sway me with your rhetoric
- Analysis trumps Evidence (not to say that evidence isn't important- you're just not gonna win automatically bc you have stronger cards)
- I think that LD is about engaging two conflicting moral standards. Tackle the conflict head on and take it to the next level (there isn't much to evaluate if you just let your rebuttal hang out there as a tag line or one sentence that rehashes what your criterion is).
WHY does your value/criterion outweigh the other in this situation? If you can analytically dismantle your opponents case and argumentation-awesome. 
- Will be impressed with an advanced/mature handling of philosophical schools/philosophers that you use in your cases
- Always relay to me why you've won the debate. even forecast when you see a potential reason that'll become a voter. (2NR and 2AR MUST have voters)
