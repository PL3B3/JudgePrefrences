  I like debaters to have clear communication, good evidence and examples, and to be civil during their rounds. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't seem to me like they focus on the main question being asked in the resolution. The value debate is a very important part of the debate for me. Debaters may lose a "contention" for me, but still win the debate if they win the value debate. Clash is central to BOTH sides of the debate. I do not consider the cross examination in my decision. That's for you.

I am currently coaching students at junior varsity and varsity level on this topic.

I work extensively with my teams.

I do flow..

If you do your best and treat your opponent with respect, you will get the same treatment from me in return!
