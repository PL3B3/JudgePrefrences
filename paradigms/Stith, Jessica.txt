Forest Park/Baltimore Urban Debate League

I am a debate coach and teacher. I have judged a lot of rounds in Baltimore, some regionally, and some at national tournaments (Kentucky, Harvard, Georgetown). I coach teams who run performance arguments, critical arguments, and a few who run traditional debate arguments. If I have to call for cards in order to know what your argument was/is, there is something wrong. Be clear! I'm a educator first and the oratorical skill of debating well is important. Feel free to make whatever decisions you like about speed, but know that if I am not hearing arguments, I am not flowing them. I will say "clear" or "slow" when necessary.

Have a praxis for how the debate should be judged and make sure I know what it is. A debate about how debate should be judged is far more interesting to me than one over the meaning of "it" in the resolution. I will let you make the choices about what's important in the debate and I try to be as open to the decisions you make as I can. That said, if you leave it up to me I may default to position you don't care for and we'll both be unhappy. Make choices in rebuttal so you can narrow the debate and focus on why you should win. Be explicit on what you think you're winning, why, and why that argument or part of an argument matters. Real world impacts outweigh theoretical nuclear war impacts when I'm left to my own devices, so keep that in mind.

I want to hear your voice in debate; interpret your evidence and arguments for me. Be passionate, be involved and be respectful. This should be fun, regardless of the ballot.
