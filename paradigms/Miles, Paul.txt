  CX:

I am a second year coach. I will flow. Explain warrants. I prefer depth on the debate. Speed is okay.

LD:
I prefer traditional style debate, but I am open to all kinds of arguments as long as they are explained well and provide an adequate link to the resolution. In final speeches make sure voter issues are clear--- tell me why I should vote for you.

Since this is LD and not policy, I would prefer a value/value criterion debate over theory and kritiks.

Good luck!
