  I am a former debate coach who used who has coached at Flower Mound H.S., Centennial H.S., and Wakeland H.S. This is my second year of not coaching, but I do judge at tournaments frequently.

I competed in LD and am very traditional when it comes to that event. If you spread in LD, then you may win the round, but will lost speaker points. I expect value and criterion debate and extension. I do not like Kritiks, Plans, or CP in LD. I do expect voters, but also line-by-line refutation. I like to see an even balance of philosophy and pragmatics when it comes to argumentation and case construction.
In CX, spreading is fine as long as its clear. I love Topicality and am pretty basic when it comes to how I evaluate the round. I don't LOVE Kritiks, but am okay with them.

In Public Forum, just remember that I am an LDer at heart and be very aware of that during crossfire.
