  Experience:
12th year of teaching debate. Competed in debate and speech in high school, and graduated in 1989.

Judging:
Prefer line-by-line refutation, so plenty of clash.
I don't have an aversion to any argument, if the debater shows me how to evaluate/weigh the argument in the round.
My decision is based on the arguments left on the flow at the end of the round, and which debater more effectively shows how the arguments should be evaluated/weighed in accordance with accepting or rejecting the resolution. I prefer some form of crystallization or synthesis in the final rebuttals.
Effective communication skills are valued.
