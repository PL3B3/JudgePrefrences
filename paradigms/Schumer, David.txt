I have no formal debate experience. I started judging to support my son sam ;
1) I am okay with moderate speed, but not super fast i will raise my hand to slow down once if i am not following you. if i can't flow it I can't give you credit;


 2) I judge based on flow,. I am pretty non exciting in that way. Give me value criterion and evidence and address your opponents case thats all I ask. I have a low threshhold for extensions, a high threshold for voting issues.




3) I don't prefer policy style arguments, I am okay with them but your going to have to spell it out to me IE if you are running a plan say so.

I love judging. LD debaters are incredibly smart and educate me on every round. Good luck in your next tournament.
