  I debated LD for four years at Ankeny High School in Iowa. I graduated in 2011 and have spent very little time in the debate community since.

-I'll evaluate any argument that's well warranted, properly extended, and impacts to an evaluative framework that's also been cleanly established.

-Reasonable theory arguments are fine, just make sure there's clear abuse. I'll vote on RVIs. I think "drop the arg, not the debater" arguments are pretty persuasive. I'm a tough sell on potential abuse 

-I personally never had a lot of experience with kritiks, CPs, or DAs. If you want to run them, explain the arguments and their implications well

If there was anything I was unclear about, feel free to have me clarify before the round
