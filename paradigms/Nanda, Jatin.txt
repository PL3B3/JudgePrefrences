  I am a 3rd year debater from Alpharetta Highschool.

Here's just some of my opinions on a few arguments/advice on how to debate them successfully in front of me.

Topicality
I don't really default to either reasonability or competing interpretations - don't assume I do - this is a debate that needs to be had within the round.
-Evidence comparison is tremendously important in terms of setting a better brightline/predictability
-The neg should have a clear interpretation with a caselist of what they allow and what the aff justifies
-The aff should have a clear C/I that competes with the negative's interp

Kritiks
I am not tremendously well-versed in the K literature so don't assume I know everything about the many forms of Baudrillard or the specifics of Lacanian psychoanalysis - it is your job to do the explanation
-Framework debates are usually a wash - tell me what policymaking first/reps first actually means - impact in terms of how I should evaluate the round.
-K debates are much more persuasive when they are made specific to the aff - ignoring the aff wholeheartedly and reading generic state links won't give you much success
-The aff should remember they read a 1AC for a reason - use it as a weapon.

Counterplans
-If you are aff and you don't make solvency deficits you will most likely lose the debate.
-I think hyper-technical counterplans aren't necessarily bad - if you can win competition, they demonstrate a good exploration of the literature.
-I don't really default any way on counterplan theory - it's the affirmative job to win the theory argument, not just whine about fairness for 5 minutes. 

Disads
-Good disad-case debates are highly encouraged - just like any other part of the debate, focus on impact comparison.
-Distinctions and framing issues are very important to help settle issues on the line-by-line - I will give you higher speaks if you settle these issues ahead of time so I don't have to call up every card.
-Turns case arguments are encouraged, but aren't automatic round-winners - these need to be explained well

Case Stuff
-Case debates demonstrate a great amount of research and are always full of clash - these are highly encouraged
-I/l takeouts go a long way - most of the time internal link chains don't make any sense - point this out.

General
-Low-risk is not no risk, but impact defense will greatly increase your chance of outweighing the case/outweighing a disad.
-Clarity and emphasis are highly encouraged along with ethos moments and giant framing issues that shape my ballot.
