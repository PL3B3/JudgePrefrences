  Background: I debated PoFo and LD debate for four years in high school, and now I attend Brown University.

Overall:

Make sure your arguments are clear and concise. I want you to do the work and understand the round through your arguments, rebuttals, analysis, and weighing. Engage in the debate. I want to see comparisons and weighing.Speed - I would prefer for you to make sure your arguments and fleshed out and impacted rather than have several rickety ones.I don't really care for unnecessary theory, so make intelligent arguments. Being clever is a bonus.Stay organized and really paint the picture at the end. Make sure to road map as necessary.Speaker points are given on how well I thought you debated. It's an overall impression of your performance.Lastly, enjoy the debate! Don't be mean or rude, stay focused on the debate and have fun!
