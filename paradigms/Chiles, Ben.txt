So, I'll start off with a little about myself. I have some experience
with policy debate; I debated at Wayzata High School for three years
before graduating and going to Concordia College and debating for
another three years. I was an instructor at the Concordia Debate
Institute for three years and I also was a coach for Moorhead High
School for two years. I'm currently a PhD student at Northwestern
University where I study communication.

My meta-framework for debate is education. I think debate is an
activity that in my mind should be about learning, whether it's about
issues, about decision-making, critical thinking, philosophy,
argumentation, etc. But education is the primary reason we do this.

In terms of arguments, I tend to be fairly open-minded. While I was
debating, I ran a variety of arguments-- sometimes I'd run spark or
growth bad, other times I'd run discursive criticisms or the infamous
Schlag. I had rounds decided by card wars and others decided by coin
flips. So I don't have a preference for one style of debate over
another. I'm open to whatever you want to run-- as long as you can
justify it with good arguments. When it comes time to sign the ballot,
I generally follow the "path of least resistance" model. Make it easy
for me, make it clear, make it simple, and you'll probably get my
vote.
