  I debated both locally and nationally for four years at Archer in Los Angeles.

Speed: I can mostly handle it, but my flowing skills aren't as good as they used to be. Slow down if you're running something convoluted, and preferably for card names. I should be able to get it down, but if I can't, I'm not going to vote on it. If you're going fast, I expect your arguments to be very well-developed and substantive. Please don't race through your constructive and finish two minutes before your speech time is up.

Theory: Feel free to use it, but only when you think actual abuse is occurring. Make sure it includes all necessary components and that it is well-articulated. If I don't get it in early speeches, I'm not going to want to vote on it. I don't think voting on education, fairness, whatever is the most substantive/compelling thing in the world, but I'll do it if that's what the round comes down to.

Critical arguments: I never really ran them, and will probably have some trouble understanding them. I'll vote on them if they're explained well. If you're going to use them, you're probably going to have to slow down and explain them clearly. Again, please don't use them just for the sake of using them - like, if you're a senior debating a freshman and running something super convoluted just to confuse them, I'll be pissed off.

Everything else is fine. I prefer that there be some kind of standard, be it a typical value criterion or something else, that I can use to evaluate the round, but I wouldn't say it's a requirement. Just spell out a specific decision calculus for me. Burdens are fine, provided they're warranted and not one sentence blips used to exclude entire cases. A prioris are fine if they're actually pre-standard and explained as such. Extend warrants. Weigh your arguments. Be courteous. I'll evaluate any arguments you want to make provided I understand them.

If there's anything else, feel free to ask before the round.
