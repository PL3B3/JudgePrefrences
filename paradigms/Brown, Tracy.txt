  My name is Tracey Brown.

I am a parent judge. I have a year's experience judging traditional LD debate. Please do not spread or use technical jargon. I would prefer that you speak at a conversational pace. I will vote for debaters who explain their arguments very clearly and speak persuasively. If you can explain to me very clearly in your last speech why you should win the round, you have a much better chance. I will not disclose my decision after the round.
