  Austin Jasienski:​A good debate is one that can properly and clearly convey the importance of the argument in both a global and domestic context. I have some prior debate experience but prefer you present your argument to me like you would a lay judge, although some speed will be tolerated—if I cannot understand you or you are going too fast I will raise my hand.
Quantitative evidence, if possible, is of extreme importance to me and if you can present this to me in a clear and concise matter you will most likely win the round. CX and your ability to defend your arguments will also help win your case.
Do respect your opponent; although disrespect of the opponent may not automatically disqualify your team for winning, it will definitely knock you down in speaker points—be respectful, be kind, and have fun in the debate. Follow through with all your arguments, do not drop any arguments, and ensure they all link together.
Crystallize, crystallize, crystallize!
