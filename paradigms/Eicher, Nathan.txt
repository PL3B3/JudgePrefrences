  My feeling is that the content of the debate should be decided by the debaters. However, I am not necessarily familiar with every argument so the burden is on you to explain your argument to me. I am not comfortable voting for positions I do not understand. I will vote on framework and topicality, but I will also vote on Ks of framework and T. With all of that said I do have a few preferences.
1. Slow down on theory arguments, I will be reluctant to vote on anything I don’t originally flow.
2. Be nice- you can be funny, you can even joke with your opponents, but you should be nice. If you don’t where the line is, then don’t risk crossing it.
3. I tend to reward smart strategic decisions more than the individual arguments you make.
4. Don’t be afraid to call it like you see it- if an argument isn’t worth the paper it is written on, let me know. Not all arguments are equal, but if you let there arg have more credibility than it is worth, I will vote for it.
5. I don’t like reading evidence after the debate, I would much rather here you explain it. Hopefully I only have to read the evidence If the evidence is complex or there is significant clash, not because the debaters aren’t explaining the args to me. If one team is explaining their args and the other team isn’t, I will deeply inclined to vote for the team doing the work.
6. Tell me why I should vote- if you don’t I may vote for reasons you don’t like. I may do that anyway, but it is far less likely when I am given a decision calculus to follow.
7. I may yell clear, louder or some other instruction during your speech. I will only do this a couple of times, after that, I stop flowing.
