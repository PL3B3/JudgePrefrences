  I Debated for KCKCC for 2 yrs and now Debate at Washburn. I have about 7 yrs of Debate experience, Ranging from Performative, Policy, and Kritical. Debated for Wichita East in High School.

I',m a lazy judge don't expect me to do work for you or read cards and reconstruct the debate (Not to say I wont read evidence I just try not to.) If you want to win the debate in the Rebutals I need a collapse to the key arguments to take place as well as Impact Calc. A million arguments your winning on the flow doesn't mean they will be applied the way you want ( So do this work for me, and your speaks will reflect this)

K's - Alts need clear solvency extended, root cause arguments are persuasive to me with good examples. Floating pics are probably bad but only if the 2AC says so.

CP - Multi-Actor Fiat is also probably not good unless you can pull examples to when its been done in the past. I dont like Delay CP's But I do love creative adv Counterplans. If you want to beat a CP I need an Impact to the net benefit of the perm, Solvency Deficits arnt very persuasive to me when the net benefit has an Impact.

Theory - If you want to go for this I need proven abuse or strong competitive equity claims.

Alt - Styles - Do whatever you want

Roses are red Violets are blue
You do Stuff Different
Good For you.

I have no real preferences that I haven't talked about above.

If you have any Question Just ask.
