  I am a parent judge and prefer traditional LD debate.
I am slow on flowing, don't go crazy fast. Please sign-post well. If you go super fast, chances are I have no idea what you are saying. 
Topical arguments have a lot more voting weight to me than theory or kritiks, and I may not be able to evaluate theories efficiently.
