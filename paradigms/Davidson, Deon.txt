  I have judged 24 rounds on this years topic. I have been debating for 5 years including the collegiate level. I am a very kritikal/performance debater. With that being said, i have a high threshold for framework; meaning, i expect you to defend the way in which you debate and the implications it produces. I am more familiar with Marxist, AfroPess, BlackFem, and Fanonian literature. I believe too many judges want you to tailor your performance for them but i believe you should do you, have swag and bring a warrant & impact to your claim.
I have done "traditional" policy debate as well so I'm fine with high tech rounds but please remember ethos pathos and logos if you're not passionate, your speaker points won't be either ok? 
Oh P.S. I'm big on discourse K's saying something oppressive is a voting issue.
