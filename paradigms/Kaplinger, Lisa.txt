  I debated for Millard South for 4 years, graduated in 2008.
No college debate.


I like policy arguments but I did critical most of my debate career. Framework is a way to view the round not a "round winner". Topicality, I feel, is an important aspect to debate even though it is losing popularity. Run whatever you want just make sure you are able to explain it well and you distinguish the world of plan vs. the world of the alternative.
