  Background
I was a debater for 4 years (Did LD for a year and a half) in Clements High School, in Texas, and now I am a Berkeley student.

Paradigms/Philosophies
Speed is one of the most important things to me when judging a debate round. Go too fast and I'll simply leave out what I don't catch, meaning that if you want to call drops on it or something I won't flow it across for you. That being said, I am okay with about a 5/10, so you can talk quickly but DO NOT SPREAD/SPEW.

I am a huge judge on the actual body of the discussion, the points involved. I recognize the importance of V/VC in LD, but keep in mind that the big picture is what wins you rounds. Tie your points to real world applications if possible. As much as I follow the flow of debate, I'm not going to buy an argument that "cockroaches are moral and thus nukes are good" unless your opponent throws the round with an equally dumb argument. I'm not much interested in a definition debate, so don't throw a "My definition is from this source" at your opponent. If the definition is important, back it up with why it is more applicable in this situation. CLASH IS IMPORTANT!

Kritiks/Theory are not preferred, but if you do, you have to make them make sense. I will buy the argument so long as it is good.

Feel free to ask me for critiques after the round.
