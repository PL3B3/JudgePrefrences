I was president of my debate club for two years at my high school, increasing membership sixfold. I was a 7-time Best Speaker in Northern California. Enunciation and sentence clarity are vital, far more so than speed. If I cannot understand your argument, I cannot take it into account. I highly value arguments that are 'outside the box' since they prove a creative understanding of the subject debated. Concrete evidence and examples will strengthen your position. Emphasize your argument's conclusion by slowing down at the end.
