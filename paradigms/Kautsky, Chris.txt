  I have five years’ experience judging Public Forum debate. I do not believe that Public Forum is a training ground for Policy. I am not in favor of speed and do not want evidence cards flying back and forth. 
I try to maintain a “tabula rasa” attitude towards the topic and evaluate each debate in isolation. I do flow and track the progress of the debate. 
A winning team in my room should present logical arguments based on evidence, have a confident and poised speaking style, demonstrate synergy and teamwork, and use the speeches as intended ending with clear voters. 
I score cross fire but don’t enter arguments onto the flow unless incorporated into the speeches. 
I have seen the benefits of success in Public Forum extend from debate into real life and am committed to the integrity of this event.
