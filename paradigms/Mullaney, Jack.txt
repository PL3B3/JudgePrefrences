  I debated for four years at Edina High School, graduating in 2009. My only connection to debate since then has been judging at the Minneapple each year, a mix of VLD and JVLD. 

Debate always has new buzzwords that people are expected to know. If the word is new since 2009, I likely don't know it. 

The good news is that I'm receptive to alternative forms of argumentation outside a traditional value/value criterion framework. I’ll vote on basically any argument as long as it has a developed warrant and clear implication in terms of the ballot. One-sentence blips and non-impacted arguments are not arguments. I’m fine with any structure you choose to adopt for your case as long as the link story is clear. Consequently, if I do not understand why your position gives me a reason to vote for you, I won’t.

I’m mediocre-to-bad at flowing, so please, please, please, please for the love of God slow down for author names and tags. You should also be signposting and enumerating your arguments; saying "2" or "3" is better than saying “moreover,” or “also”. I’ve seen lack of signposting cause a lot of confusion for both judges and debaters, so play it safe.

I don’t care if you dress up, dress down, swear, sit, or eat during the round, just be comfortable and have fun.
