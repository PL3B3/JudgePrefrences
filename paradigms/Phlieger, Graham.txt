Overall Philosophy
Debate is a learning activity as well as a method of self-expression. If pressed for time then know I evaluate the debate round as its presented as a tab critic. You debate your style of debate and I as a judge will vote off of what you tell me to. There are very few arguments that I don't want to hear. Feel free to ask me any questions before the round starts. 


Speed/ Rate of Delivery/ Speaker Points
You can go as fast as you want/ need but1) Clarity should not be lost for speed
2) I will clear you twice before I stop flowing if I cant understand your argumentation.
Things to help get higher speaker points1) Humor
2) In-depth analysis
3) Analogies
4) Great extensions
5) Original arguments

Arguments I DON"T want to hear/ what will get your speaks docked

There are some arguments I am more lenient on than other judges will be. One example is Satire, but there is a very fine line that comes with these types of arguments. Here are some general tips.
Don't use ad hominemsNo homophobia, xenophobia, or any other type of exclusion will be allowedIf you think something is going to be offensive then ask me before the round starts as a side of caution
