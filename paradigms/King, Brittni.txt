I debated for one year at San Diego State University.

I have been in law school for the past couple years, so I have not been too involved with debate. Try to use few topic specific acronyms and go a little bit slower (especially on T), so I do not miss your arguments.

I was a counter plan/disad debater in college, but I am open to different argument styles. I just need EVERYTHING - ALL ARGUMENTS - explained thoroughly. One good piece of evidence is better than five mediocre pieces of evidence.

Have fun, be nice, and explain EVERYTHING!
