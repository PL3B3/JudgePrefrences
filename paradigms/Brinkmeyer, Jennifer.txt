  1. I have to be able to hear and understand you. I can flow LD-quick but not policy-quick, for the most part. Eye contact, gesture, pause, and inflection help me understand where you want me to focus.
2. All hail Toulmin. I love solid argumentation. Contentions should be backed up by credible evidence. Make the connection between the two clear.
3. Go for the clash. Point out fallacies, don't drop arguments, engage in what comes up.
4. Have a dialogue. Debate the issues professionally and critically without humiliating or terrorizing your opponent.
5. Keep the debate slang basic.
6. Use frameworks if you want but be wary of blatantly telling me that I have to vote for you. Instead, discuss your contentions that are still standing and your opponent's contentions that have fallen.

I typically vote for who's got the most arguments left standing at the end of the round. If it's close, I'll defer to whose arguments were more valid and/or who debated with more poise.
