  In high school i debated LD in Las Vegas for 4 years. I also attended VBI. I graduated from CSU Northridge in 2011 with a degree in Comparative Religion. 

It has been a while since I judged national circuit LD so you'll want to slow down a bit and explain the jargon. I prefer a debate that impacts to a standard and that the debaters weigh comparatively. I'll flow rounds and do my best to base my decision on the flow.
