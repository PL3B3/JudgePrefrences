  I am a third-year debater at Niles West High School. As of the 2013 Dowling Catholic Paradigm, it's fair to say that I am very new to judging. That being said, I do not have a concrete set of principles ready to recite to you throughout this judge philosophy. I'll keep this simple.

Do whatever you think or feel like doing. Exceptional debate is not so much as the content of ideas being argued, but the delivery and execution of them. You want to tell me that warming is good? Fine. Your aff solves for all kinds of war everywhere? Sure. Just keep me interested.

As per the rules of the game, you bend them. I'm not going to discuss the validity of conditionality or how I evaluate the kritik. You tell me how I evaluate the kritik or whether I should vote for conditionality and why.

There is, however, the matter of ethos and simple debate etiquette in the round. Again, I'll keep it simple. There is a fine line between being assertive/confident/sharp and being rude/disrespectful/imposing. Don't be the latter.

If you have any questions, email me at julsar1@nths219.org.
