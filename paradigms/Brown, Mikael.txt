Background: I competed on the local and national debate circuit for two and a half years. One year I debated in policy, and the rest in LD. 

I have not read lit or studied the current topic of public colleges and universities, therefore don’t assume I have extensive knowledge about your arguments. Expand your arguments, as well as state your tags clearly. I recommend you speak a bit slower.

All arguments need to be warranted and have a timeframe and strong impact calc. I will not vote if the argument is unwarranted or based on presumption. All arguments must be explained and logical. Speed needs to be at a rate where you're still speaking clearly and I can keep up. Unless your theory argument is strong and warranted, then don't make it, I rarely vote based on theory. Same thing with topicality. If you present a Kritik, clearly explain your position and make a role of the ballot argument. Before you argue your rebuttals give me a clear overview, why I should vote your side. 

Have fun.
