  Hey guys, 


I'm a college student at UC Berkeley. I competed in Lincoln-Douglas debate in high school and am especially skilled in National and International Extemporaneous speaking and Public Forum. I want a traditional, quality debate at a conversational speed, emphasizing values and not quantity of words. Please refrain from spreading, and avoid theory, kritiks, and narratives. As a judge, I'd say the most important thing to win my vote is logic. I also appreciate the usage of empirics. Convince me that your contentions are the best way to achieve your unique value. 

Thanks,
Hani

P.S. I hate people who interrupt the other speaker.
