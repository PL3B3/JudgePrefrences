  Background:

Father of a Freshman Novice LD debater at Princeton High School. First time judge. A long, long time ago I completed in high school in LD (3 years), Congress (1 year), Extemporaneous and Impromptu (4 years each). I competed at the NFL National Championships twice (Congress and Extemporaneous) and California State Championships 3 years. Best results were 5th Place nationally in Extemporaneous Commentary, and 3rd and 5th place CA State in Congress. Subsequently I was a speechwriter for the CEO of a Fortune 500 company and served as the company spokesperson.

Debate Preferences:

Slow. I prefer elegant, compelling oratory over speed, great facts over sheer quantity. Support a few key points very well and carry them through successfully defended again all challenges. Don't assume I am already fluent in your value criteria. Don't short-change the contentions. Don't let challenges to credibility of your sources go without a response.

Have fun.
