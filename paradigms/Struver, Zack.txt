  Conflicts: Hendrick Hudson, Bronx Science

I attended Hendrick Hudson High School from 2007-2011, where I debated LD for four years. I was an assistant coach at the Bronx High School of Science. I currently study law at Columbia Law School.


Please Note: I have not judged a debate round for over 2 years, so it may take me a bit to get back into the flow of things. Speed is generally not an issue, but clarity is. That being said, unless you're consistently a very clear speaker, please start out a little bit slower and then speed up. I used to coach a lot of Ks, critical race theory, etc., so I tend to enjoy debates on those issues more than I do a straight policy/big impacts debate. I really am not a fan of the classic util/deont debate, so please try to avoid that.

HOW TO GET A THIRTY:
Be clear. Run a smart, novel position. Don't use theory as a crutch. Actually extend your impacts and weigh them well. Be courteous and respectful. Adjust to your opponent (don't read a Heidegger K against a novice: it isn't educational, cool, or fair).
