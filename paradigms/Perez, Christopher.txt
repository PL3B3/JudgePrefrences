  My name is Christopher Perez, and this is my 4th year of debating at Downtown Magnets High school. Iâ€™ve qualified for the UDNC and am relatively experienced with debate; if you have more specific questions about my experiences of preferences feel free to email me at christopherp1322@gmail.comðŸ˜Š. 
General comments: 
Put me on the email chain Donâ€™t make disrespectful remarks If you only read cards without analysis/analytics you wonâ€™t earn high speaker points. Nuanced argument building merits you high speaker points Iâ€™m ok with tag-team; just donâ€™t dominate Iâ€™m ok with spreading. Differentiate tags with warrants Donâ€™t clip cards â€“ I will be checking occasionally. If you mark the card, make sure to send the rest of the room the marked version. Theory: Iâ€™m ok with theory as long as it has a purpose in the round, be it to get a link or the other team is actually doing something pretty questionable. Obviously if theory is dropped by the opponents and that becomes what you go for, Iâ€™ll vote for it. However, if the theory is otherwise read for just time skew and the other team sufficiently answers the argument Iâ€™ll generally disregard it. If you can articulate a substantive impact then it probably has a purpose and Iâ€™ll buy the argument â€“ I wonâ€™t buy a 20 second theory argument with blippy standards just to force a time trade off. 
Kritiks: Iâ€™ve generally been a kritik debater throughout my four years of debating. I like psychoanalysis and Antiblackness if youâ€™re up to it, but I will always prefer a k debate with meaningful link stories. I will not buy a k looking for a link argument. What I mean is that I wonâ€™t buy k debates where the 1NC reads a generic link argument, and builds off the link debate based on permutation/alternative answers from the 2AC. Otherwise, if the link is contextualized and I can understand how the alternative solves the aff or solves something that outweighs the aff, I will gladly vote for the argument. If youâ€™re reading a nuanced kritikal argument that Iâ€™m not familiar with like Edelman, try to cut down on the jargon. A good k debate to me will help your speaks! 
K-affs: Iâ€™ve run these affirmatives before and I like them. I donâ€™t like k-affs that donâ€™t engage politically just because they donâ€™t want to; there HAS to be a purpose to your method. Although I like critical arguments, Iâ€™m still very political. If the neg can point out a clear TVA of your aff that can encapsulate your affirmative and remain in the political, Iâ€™ll err neg. Also, since I probably wonâ€™t be clear with many k-affs that I havenâ€™t heard before, lessen jargon and explain more. 
DA: Similar to the K, always contextualize the link. If the linkâ€™s warrants are in the context of Common Core and the aff is entirely different and the aff points this out, Iâ€™ll probably err aff (unless the negative can effectively articulate that the aff is similar to what the link story says). I donâ€™t find politics arguments too interesting, but a well-articulated DA will merit high speaker points. 
CP: I expect the CP to solve the case or at least a portion of it, and is competitive to the plan. Iâ€™ve read a lot of abusive counterplans in the past like Consultation/Agent CPâ€™s/PICs and donâ€™t mind them. Obviously if the aff can effectively debate theories against these CPâ€™s Iâ€™ll definitely buy them. 
Otherwise, please have fun!
