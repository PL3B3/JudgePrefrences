  Summary: I try to be as completely tab as possible. Whatever you say goes as long as you back it up with a reason why.

Slightly longer summary: I did CX all 4 years in High School and judged throughout and after college. I'm a fairly liberal judge, meaning I'm fine with speed, K's, performance whatever, etc. One caveat: as I judge less frequently / hear less "TOC-style" (for lack of a better phrase) rounds, my ability to coherently handle some types of "advanced" arguments/speed decreases accordingly. So it's something for you (the debater) to keep in the back of your mind. And like I said, I try to be as tab as possible. Many people have gone into long-winded summaries of what that means elsewhere, so I'll stop there. Any specific questions, just ask.
