  I did varsity policy debate at Lexington High School from 2001-2005.
I haven't been as deeply involved with the debate community over the last few years, but I have significant previous experience as a debater and a reasonable amount of experience as a judge.
Good policy debate cultivates intellectual curiosity, encourages analytical rigor and promotes awareness of and engagement with a broad set of knowledge areas (politics, law, philosophy etc.). I have seen these benefits manifest themselves in all types of people. Debate has a lot to offer in the moment and also down the line, as participants build upon the skills and topics that they encountered on the HS debate circuit.
I don't have super strong or strict opinions on what I will or won't vote for, as long as it's well-reasoned and backed with evidence (doesn't have to be specific cards - evidence comes in many forms).
I'm not a huge fan of rudeness or excessive jargon, but I'm willing to vote for anything as long as it's sufficiently explained.
