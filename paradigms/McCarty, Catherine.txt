  I'm a parent judge for Mountain Brook. I will be judging JV LD at the Glenbrooks. I don't know much about debate other than what my son who does policy tells me, so please speak slowly and clearly. I don't really care about a strict value premise/criterion; just make logical arguments that prove your side of the resolution.
