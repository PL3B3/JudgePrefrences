  Judge Experience - Fourth year judging (LD, PF), third year judging CX.

Education/Background - I am an Engineer so I really understand the science and love analytic arguments. I will judge on analytics but you need to provide logic and/or evidence to back up your arguments. I bring no personal bias into a round and will judge based upon the arguments presented, regardless of my personal feelings or beliefs.

Judging - I am a communications judge but you can spread, just clarify your tag lines. I cannot judge philosophical Kritiks. I am not fond of Topicality arguments but I will listen to them and rarely judge on them unless the Aff is really being abusive. If you run Topicality arguments please give me lots of other arguments to base my opinion on. I will flow the debate and use my flow, especially in close rounds. Many rounds I judge are won/lost in the rebuttal phase. It is important to me that opponents are courteous to each other and I think speakers should use their allotted time. I have a hard time awarding a win to a team that leaves time on the clock and the teams appear to be disorganized.
