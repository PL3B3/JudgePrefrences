  I debated four years for Millburn High School (NJ), attended TOC twice, and cleared to octafinals my senior year. I will be teaching at both VBI and NSD.

I’m willing to vote on any type of argument so long so long as it’s not blatantly offensive; saying racism is a good thing probably won’t get you far. With regard to critical and other dense arguments, err on the side of over-explanation rather than under. 

I default to competing interps, reject the argument, and no RVIs. Feel free to make arguments for reasonability, reject the debater, and RVIs. I don’t believe in offensive counter-interps and think they need RVI justifications in order for me to vote on them, but if your opponent doesn’t point that out then I’ll evaluate it like any other theory shell. Fairness and education are voters and reading fairness is not a voter will get you a loss with -5 speaks. I'll listen, but not happily, to arguments stating that education isn't a voter.

If your opponent is obviously less experienced than you are, make an attempt to help, rather than exclude them. You don’t need to read topicality on novices, etc.

Speaks are scaled according to the tournament. If you have any questions, feel free to ask before the round.
