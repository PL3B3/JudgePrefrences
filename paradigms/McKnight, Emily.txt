  Hello!

I was a varsity policy debater in a Missouri high school and went to Nationals twice. I can flow well and can follow along with most speeds. I will let you know during your speech if you're speaking too quickly. 

I'm not a huge fan of kritiks, but will go with one if it's well thought out and argued. 

I love good cards and evidence. If you're making a claim about what a card says, it better say it and mean it. I don't like it when people read part of a card and then leave out something that contradicts what they're trying to claim. As such, I like seeing teams pick through the other team's cards and pull out inconsistencies (if they're there). 

I like to see tangible evidence supporting any points offered in your contentions. If your opponent gives clear evidence and you do not, I will probably side with your opponent on that point based on the fact that there is substance offered. Please make sure to tie your evidence back to your contentions. 

If an argument is dropped by either side (even an Aff Advantage from the 1A), I'll give that win to the other team. However, the other team must make it clear that the issue was dropped. If you dropped an argument, there's still chance for you if you're able to discuss the impacts from another argument that you could win. If you're not able to refute an argument, at the very least acknowledge it during your speech and say you disagree (even quote back to a previous card).

I like Advantages and Disadvantages. I need them to be filled out though with a clear connection to the case and a good impact. I like Topicality if not done to excess. 

I love a good CX. I also prefer for you to stand when giving speeches or giving CX.

I appreciate respect for your opponents and partner.

Most of all, I like to be persuaded.
