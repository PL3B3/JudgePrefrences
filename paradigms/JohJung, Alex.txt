  My Biography
Four years debating both Local and NAT circuit. Freshmen year I won 3/5 CDLs and semis in the other two ( I think it was semis?). Following years had similar but lower levels of success. On the National Circuit I've made lost alot of bid rounds on stupid stuff (FeelsBadMan). I did LD and policy. I'm from Evanston Township HS. I'm currently a student at the University of Chicago aka father school of neoliberalism. If you read the same neolib shit as the same kid I just judged I might look really bored.

You are running to your room right now (Or I am):
You are fine. I judge flow. Speed is cool. I'll call clear if I have to. Slow on tags. Anything goes just don't be an asshat.

Doing prefs?

I love kritiks and I love hearing nuance kritiks too. K tricks are awesome. I was an afropess debater. I do have a high threshold for voting on Ks though like you better do that shit well. K kid? pref me 1-3, but don't just know it, show it.

Theory: I have a grudge against theory especially theory against Ks, but that doesn't mean I won't vote on it.
If your a theory hack pref me 2-4. I

Policy/LARP/Stock/Lay/Trad? Pref me 1-3. Just know I may possibly fall asleep.

POINTS ! FREE POINTS !

Read a Nick Land 92 card as an off case and name it something funny. You get a .4 speaker point boost.

Give me food and get a .1 boost. I like sour candies. Cheese Pizza (HOT). Juice. Anything else and you get lower speaks.

If you read the Exorcism 1AC, stick to it and try to win with it, then I might give you the L but you will get 30 points and have my full attention.
