I'm incredibly open to most types of argumentation and styles of debate. I've competed in LD, policy, and parli, so I'm comfortable with just about any type of argument you want to run. I'm also fine with you speaking as quickly as you'd like, just as long as you're clear and slow down for tags (if you're not, I'll yell clear). So, please, debate the way you feel most comfortable debating.

The easiest place to win (or lose) my ballot is on the framework debate. I like you to clearly articulate the world in which you're debating and what burdens that world entails for both sides in the debate. I also want you to VERY EXPLICITLY warrant your framework and tell me why it's the best way to evaluate the round.

I'm fine with theory, k's, truth-testing, DA's, CP's, performance, etc. insofar as they're done well and warranted. Basically, I'll vote for any argument as long as it's warranted, and its weight in the round is clearly specified. Also, always focus on why you're winning the round not why your opponent is losing-- offense= good. 

I think my entire judging philosophy can be summed up in 2 words: warrant and impact. Do both of these, and you'll be fine.
