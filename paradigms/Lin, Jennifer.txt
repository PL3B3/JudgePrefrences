  Rio Americano High School- Coach
Judged High School PF and Parli for 5 years, LD for 1

Paradigm-
I prefer traditional debate, so I think that kritiks/disads/counterplans should stay in policy. I'm also not a huge fan of theory, so explain very carefully why something is abusive, etc. I don't like spreading because I don't see the educational value behind it; I'm more convinced by someone who I can understand rather than someone with a million points who I can't understand.
Coming from a mainly PF and Parli background, explain the jargon that you'll throw out; if you can do that well, I can easily be swayed. I only flow taglines, so be wary of that, and I judge based on the value, so impacts/links are very important.
