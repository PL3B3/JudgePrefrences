  First-time judge. Trained in traditional. Impacts explain why I should care about something in the round. 

LD: Clear value/contention clash. Framework will shape the round and set up voters and impacts. Contentions are important, but unless the impact of a dropped/defeated contention is made clear, it will be difficult to vote on at the end of the round. Kritiks should be clearly explained in framework. 

PF: Clash makes a round enjoyable. Clear impacts and refutation of contentions is necessary, but debaters can't expect to win on defensive arguments. Contention turns are the best offense, and strong case is best to be built on. Clear voters that draw the difference between the two worlds are helpful. 

CX: First time judging. Moderate speed is helpful; it is very helpful to repeat/re-read the taglines and card-citations in the round - saves time in CX and helps the judge flow correctly the first time. Impacts should be stressed, and don't assume that I know everything.

Progressive debaters: Slow to a moderate speed and enunciate. Use terms like "impact" and "world" language to help make flowing clear.
