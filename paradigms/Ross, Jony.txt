  Topic experience: I have judged at least 40 rounds on this topic

Debate experience/background: I did four years of debate in high school starting with PF and shifting towards policy especially during my senior year. My partner and I placed ninth in 2013 at nationals in Birmingham. I debated on the national circuit frequently during my senior year. I have been working with my high school team throughout the 2013-2014 year and am very familiar with the topic.

General paradigm/philosophy: Tabula Rasa.

Speed: 9/10. Speed is fine but I'd like to be able to catch the tags.

Topicality: I tend only to vote on T if your opponents seriously mishandle an argument or if there is obvious in round abuse. 

DAs: I definitely love disad debate but impact calc should be a major part of your 2NR if you are going for one. 

CPs: Counter plans are cool but I'm not a fan of PIC's.

Kritiks: Make sure you understand the literature for your K if you plan on running one. I am familiar with a variety of these arguments so make sure you also have an understanding of what you are running. I love it when a team is actually passionate about their K and can not only articulate it, but appear to believe in it within the round. However with that said, it's not as if I won't vote for your K if you don't understand it. If the Affirmative team doesn't sufficiently answer it, I am still forced to vote Neg, however much I don't want to. 

Theory: I'm cool with theory debates. However I prefer theory that questions the case and not the team.

Non-Traditional/Performance debate: I'm definitely down to Klown.
