  I'm a freshman at Ithaca College. I debated policy for two years at Ingraham High School and will start debating for Cornell in the spring. In high school I was personally a pretty critical debater but had a few very policy partners. I encourage you to make the debate something you enjoy. I'll vote for whatever the debaters make important in the round but I suppose if I'm given literally zero framing, I probably default to a policy-making paradigm. I encourage you not to let me default to anything.
