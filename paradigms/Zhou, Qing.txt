I am a typical parent judge. I prefer conversational speed or a bit faster. I like to view the case through the value/value criteria. I also like few well-developed contentions better than many hastily covered points. I do open to and vote for any well-explained and reasonable argument such as priori, theory etc. However I prefer the debate to focus on the issue at hands and avoid far fetched K's with too many link chains.
