I love discussions of the Topic. You have to answer T. I have heard and debated some of the fastest so do your thing. On the Neg mostly anything goes. If it is morally repugnant than I will have a very hard time voting for it. 

I believe that debate is about testing ideas to see what is best for your community and surrounding communities. 

I love interesting debates.... and I need them so If you read 100 cards in your 1AC or if you sing in it .... I need it to be interesting!

I need to see clash. If there is no clash then what am I to vote on. I will look for the easy way out if there is no clash.

Oh and I give high speaks if I feel like your swagg is turned all the way up. I love funnies too. 


Swagg+funny+clash+interesting+discussions of the topic+all that cute debate stuff =My ballot
