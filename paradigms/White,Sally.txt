  I did policy debate for 4 years in high school at Auburn Riverside High School in Washington State, then I did policy debate for 3 years in college at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington and competed on the regional and national circuits, including attending and making it to out-rounds at CEDA Nationals and the NDT. I worked at the Gonzaga Debate Institute for 2 summers and part-time assistant coached policy debate at Mead High School in Spokane, Washington for 2 years.

I am now an attorney in SF and have not been involved in policy debate since 2005, except I did judge at a tournament in February of this year. Apart from that tournament, I am unfamiliar with this year's topic. But, don't worry, my pre-2005 skills are coming back pretty quickly - just keep in mind I am an old-timer - help me out!

I should be fine with speed, so long as you are clear, and clearly delineate each point/sub-point you are making so I can flow it. Give me a roadmap at the beginning of your speech. Explain your arguments and tell me why they matter. I don't favor one type of argument over another - just go with what your strengths are. But impact comparison is important, and that goes for all of your arguments - procedural, DAs, CPs, Kritiks, or whatever crazy argument you may have. Just tell me why it matters and why it means you should win. But keep in mind - if I don't understand it, I'm not going to vote for it - so if you are doing something performance-related or something philosophically complex, make sure you translate it into layman's terms regarding what on earth you are saying and why it matters, or else you might lose me. Just remember I've been out of this for a while. Also, please split up the neg block. Give a brief overview at the top of your speech (except for 1AC/1NC) to explain why your arguments outweigh. I'd appreciate it if you'd do the work for me - tell me why you win. That's about it. Thanks.
