  I've had plenty of experience judging at over 20 tournaments in the following events - Public Forum, Congress, Lincoln-Douglas, Extemporaneous Speaking, Original Oratory, Interpretation of Literature, and Impromptu Speaking. Strong debaters have a balance of facts, statistics, engaging rhetoric and clear delivery. Although I don't prefer when competitors spread, I can understand what they are saying, which is most important. The winning team / debater is able to deliver strong, well-supported, and prepared arguments while pointing out and breaking down flaws in the opponent's arguments.
