  As of now, I am currently a beginner judge within LD. Here are a few preferences I have about judging:

Speed: Please don't spread. I won't understand anything if you go too fast. Be clear and concise.

Cases: At present, I don't have experience at judging anything beyond standard cases. Please avoid using things like theories or Ks

Voting: I tend to pick in favor of the generally better presented case and rebuttal. Work to create links to your opponents evidence and your own for refutation and setting precedencr If you can clearly explain the reasons I should vote on your side, and your arguments hold up against your opponent, I should vote for you.

Courtesy: I expect both debaters to be good sports and display good character and courtesy towards each other and me. I will dock points if I believe any personal attacks are made.
