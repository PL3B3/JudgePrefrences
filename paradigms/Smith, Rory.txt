  Notre Dame debater for 4 years - competed in policy debate for first 2 years and then did IPPF for the last two years. Attended the Berkeley Debate camp after sophomore year. Not a lot of experience judging on the ocean topic so please make sure to explain any acronyms. Went primarily for policy arguments and case debate while competing in policy. Curently, a freshman at berkeley, but not on policy debate team.
