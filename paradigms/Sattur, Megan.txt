  I was an LDer for three years at Montville Twp. HS, dabbled in PF and CX, and graduated in 2010. Unfortunately, I was not able to continue debating in college. 

It appears that "traditional LD judge" means that no further explanation is necessary. I do my best to keep personal biases out of the judging process. If you have any questions, feel free to ask before the round. 

However, for the purpose of clarification, I'll detail the things that don't work for me:
Counter plans
Critiques
Theory

Things within the realm of traditional debate that I like: 
Value/VC debates
Observations
Burdens

Speed is only an issue when you talk like a policy debater. 
I tend to be conservative with speaker points and frequently give oral critiques at the end of the round, but rarely disclose. I try to give detailed ballots that show the crystallization of the round so you understand where you went wrong and how to fix it. Frequently, I list the three arguments that weighed most heavily and detail why you won/lost and how you could have changed the outcome.
