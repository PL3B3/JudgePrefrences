  Short: Go for whatever you want, but be clear and be nice. I can promise you I’m okay with almost every argument you can decide to run, but don’t be afraid to ask about it before the round starts. If you and I, or you and your opponent are on different wavelengths it just becomes a shit show and nobody’s happy. I want you to succeed, so do a good job and I’ll reward you for it.

Note: BE FUNNY even if you make an unfunny joke, odds are I'll still laugh at your misery.

Less short: I debated for 3 years at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, FL in LD and PF. I qualified to the TOC in both my senior year, though I mostly competed in LD. I’m a pretty laid back judge and I’m okay with whatever you want to throw at me.

Speed won’t be an issue, but clarity will. I may ask you to slow down though because I don’t hear spreading on a regular basis anymore.

Run whatever argument you want, in fact I’ll probably be more impressed if you can pull off a crazier argument. If you do go for something a little less orthodox, however, you do have to perform it. Make me believe that it is orthodox.

I’m pretty well read in philosophical literature, so any philosophy that you’d like to propose, odds are I’ve heard of it. But…

If I haven’t heard of the philosophy/argument you’re running, make sure you can explain it to me well. And hopefully your opponent too, considering his understanding would make it a debate round, as opposed to just you sweeping the floor with him (which is a lot less fun to watch).

If you have any more questions, ask me. This is nowhere near as thorough as I could be, but I figure there will end up being a lot of stuff you don’t care about. If you ask me questions specific to the way you debate, my answers to said questions will probably be a lot more helpful than a 10 page paradigm.
