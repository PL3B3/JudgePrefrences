Don't find Theory too compelling. K's are fine as long as you explain it and I can understand it, otherwise, I'm not inclined to vote for it since I don't have too much of a K or philosophy background. Prefer policy arguments mostly. Speed is fine but I will not call slow or clear, I will just stop writing.
