  Judging Philosophy:

I judge based on just a few points.
There should be strong cases on both sides.Make sure you extend your contentions.Don't drop your opponent's contentions in your rebuttals.When it comes to speed, feel free to go as fast as you like - I will flow it. However, speed doesn't equal a good case. I will be paying attention to your substance so if there is nothing there don't expect to win unless your opponent drops your contentions.If it becomes a framework debate, you better give me voting issues and a counter framework to work with.I expect civility at all times - personal attacks do not earn you any points with me ... even if they are funny.You cannot influence me with a large Dunkin Donuts coffee with four sugars and skim milk - don't even try ... seriously ... don't.
