PF JUDGING EXPERIENCE: 2 years

Philosophy: Win by providing sound reasoning, succinct organization, strong and credible evidence, and clear delivery.

I am not a fan of those who try to speak so fast that it is almost a different language. A few strong arguments will defeat the many weak ones uttered at breakneck pace.

Please be polite and show respect to your opponent and the judges. Showing a lack of respect is the quickest way to lose an argument in PF as well as real life.

Good Luck!
