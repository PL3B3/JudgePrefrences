I am not like most valley debaters, I wasa K debater

ask any questions you want before the round, this is very bare bones.

my familiar literature is Baudrillard, Nietzsche, Agamben, sort of Deleuze and Guattari.

I'm not into blippy args, they should be fully developed, this includes theory spikes.
