Flay judge - not a teacher/coach, in the tax law field


Mainly a PF judge but the last few nat circuits, I have been in LD. I love creative, different arguments that you can link well to the topic, I draw the line at progressive.


Other items.


-No spreading
-Absolutely no progressive
-I don't appreciate aggression- no need for it really, no really!
-Always signpost, but no cliches 
-I don't recognize arguments composed of lengthy and convoluted link chains 
-I only call for evidence if I have reason to believe it is being misconstrued 
-Do not ask me what it takes to get a 30. A 30 means you were perfect. I have only given a 30 five times throughout my years of judging.
-I really appreciate a clear framework 
At the end of the round, the winner of the debate is the team that sustains their arguments, meaning that, I expect anything you want me to vote on to be in summary and final focus. I think that frontlines should be made as early as rebuttal (if speaking second), but will be accepted in summary. Lastly, weighing is very important to me. Please begin to weigh in summary, but seal the deal in final focus. Even if you are only winning on one argument, but you extend it into summary and final focus and explain why the impacts of that argument are the most important in that round; you will receive my ballot.
