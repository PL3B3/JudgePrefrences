  I debated at Robbinsdale Cooper High School, I graduated in 2008 and am currently coaching there.

The above should indicate to you that I was what I would consider a fairly traditional debater, and am teaching my students the same way, what does this mean for you?
A few important things-

-Link arguments to a criterion, I cannot figure out why on earth I hear a criterion debate so rarely these days, much less any links back to one. You can be pretty sure that if one debater ignores the criterion yet has a whole bunch of random extended offense and the other has less extended offense but is engaging in the criterion debate and linking back to it, I won;t care how convincing your extended sub point whatever is...I will vote based upon the criterion that is given me and any links to it.

-I'm only going to say this once: don't run theory in front of me, just don't. I'm tired of it, I will not be happy, engage in the topic please. If you choose to ignore this fair warning your record and your speaks will suffer severely.

-That said, I'm generally okay with speed. If you are going so fast you are stumbling over words or not making sense, I won't yell anything at you but I will probably stop flowing and stare at you blankly. If you don't pick up on this it is you who will suffer since I won't have your arguments flowed.

-Otherwise just be clear about where you are on the flow at all times, and give me a good reason at the end of the round for why you win.
