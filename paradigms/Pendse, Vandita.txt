MVLA '17

I debated for a few years on the circuit and am now at Berkeley.

Conflicts: MVLA

edit for berkeley 2018: 
PLEASE READ THEORY i miss it and will boost your speaks


I’ll probably fuck up a super techy round because I haven’t debated in a while. As a debater, I ran a lot of theory and Kant and I’m fairly comfortable with phil/theory debate. BUT I literally haven't listened to spreading in a long long long time so if you make me listen to a super techy round I will be sad and you probably will too because I might fuck up evaluating it.

In general though, I’m pretty willing to buy any argument that isn’t blatantly offensive or problematic.

The messier the round is (the more work you make me do), the lower your speaks will be, even if both of you are super talented debaters. Do all the weighing and make the round as clean as possible - don’t make me do work for you.

If you’re a novice and you make smart args I’ll reward you with good speaks even if you aren’t super tech.

Realistically, I'm competent enough to evaluate a round, but I don't think you want me in elims or in a bubble.

*If you read off your computer for the entirety of your 2n I'll tank your speaks because I think that's legitimately idiotic*

Automatic 29+ if you bring me chocolate (probably maybe kind of)
