  I debated locally and nationally for four years for Walt Whitman High School. I now attend Brown University.

Overall: When debating in front of me, you should articulate some sort of standard, explain to me why you are winning that standard, and then link and weigh offense to it. I prefer a comparative evaluation of rounds and will default to that evaluation. I will, however, listen to a truth-testing framework and use it if that interpretation wins. I like creative arguments, but keep in mind that: (1) I am not familiar with most “critical” authors and (2) I won’t vote for something if it is blatantly offensive. I also will not vote for arguments that I do not think were completely extended (warrant +impact) in rebuttals.

Speed: This generally shouldn’t be a huge problem as long as you don’t go at your top speed. While I was generally able to flow fast rounds when I debated, I haven’t had to do so in 9 months. As a result, I doubt that I will be able to flow as fast as you can speak. You can certainly go quickly, but if you become incomprehensible to me I will yell “clear” and expect you to slow down. This should go without saying, but I will only vote on arguments that I wrote down.

Theory: I believe that theory functions as a check on abuse. As a result, I think that defense is sufficient to make theory arguments “go away” (you can run a counter-interpretation to win the theory debate, but I don’t think that you have to). I am also open to listening to RVIs as long as they are developed. Lastly, I think that, like all other arguments, every part of a theory argument must be warranted and impacted. 

Speaker points: I will assign points on a 25-30 scale, averaging a 27. Qualities like making intelligent arguments and being strategic will have a greater impact on your speaker points than your public speaking skills. Being really rude will definitely hurt you, however.
