  I am a debate teacher. My classes/team are comprised of PF, LD, Policy and extemp. I am also a licensed attorney. I will judge rounds of all types of debates based on the most clear and sensible argumentation. Although I won't discount a theoretical or highly technical argument on principle, they need to have rational merit. If I can't follow it, I'm not going to vote for it. I'll tolerate speed, but if I lose track of what points you're attempting to make I can't use them in your favor.


On Framework: Prefer a traditional one; however I will accept any case structure you present. I ask that you make your argument structure clear to facilitate flowing.

Time Signals: I will keep the official time, however I prefer you monitor your own speaking times, so that I can concentrate on the flow. I will give them if you ask.

Things I Appreciate: road mapping and signposting, warrants and impacts on both sides of the flow, crystallization in final speech, and reasons to prefer your arguments over the opponents.

Reason For Decision: I don’t follow a standard rubric because every round is unique. I will note weaknesses and mistakes when making arguments. If your opponent points them out, you’ll lose that argument. Dropped arguments will cost you based on their proportional value in the round. Unprofessional conduct will not cost you a round, but will be reflected in speaker points. Flawless execution wins every time and will get the maximum speaker points. Disorganization during rebuttals is a big negative because it shows a lack of confidence/knowledge of the topic and gives me a reason to doubt your credibility.
