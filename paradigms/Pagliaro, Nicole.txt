If you need to put a label on the sort of judge I am I guess the closest thing would be traditionial. I can handle Kritiks and Counterplans if necessary but I much prefer the debater who sticks to the traditional value structure and persuades me on what I "ought" to do not which plan in more practical. "The art of persuasion is beautiful and just."
