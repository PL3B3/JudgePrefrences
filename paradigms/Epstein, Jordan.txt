  The following are thoughts that likely affect the way I judge. Anything else can be easily changed by debating:
- It is productive and educational to debate federal government policy.
- Dropped arguments are not automatically true. For an argument to matter, it must be sufficiently explained. If I don’t understand what your argument is at the end of the round, I won’t vote on it. If you explain your argument well the first time, this does not mean you have to re-explain the whole thing once it's dropped.
- It is possible for there to be no relevant risk of an argument.
- I won’t automatically kick an advocacy for you in the 2NR - if you also want me to consider the status quo, you have to provide impact calculus for it.
- The aff is better off going for perms instead of theory against CPs that compete off immediacy or certainty.
- You don’t need evidence to make an argument.
- Unless stated otherwise, presumption goes toward less change.
- The States CP is unrealistic and un-educational. Impact turns are awesome.
- If I can’t understand you, I’ll say clear once. After that I’ll stop flowing.
- Prep-time stops when the flash drive is out of your computer. If you steal prep after that, you’ll annoy me.
