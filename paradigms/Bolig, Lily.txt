Head Coach, Speech and Debate
I am a 3rd year coach. I can understand spreading, but I'm not a fan. Especially if you don't do it well. I didn't debate in school.
I'm not a big fan of Ks, but I'll go on your adventure if you have substantial evidence.
I think Cross-Ex can make or break a round. 
If at any time you've lost me (whether through spreading, logic, or your attitude) I will stop flowing. I'll put down my pen. You have to make me pick it back up. Be able to read the room. 

Kindness never hurt anyone - the strongest debaters are often the nicest.
