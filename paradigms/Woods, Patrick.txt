  I graduated from Bronx Science in 1999. While there, I was President of the Debate & Speech Team and Captain of the U.S. Team at Worlds. I primarily competed in Student Congress in which I was New York State Champion, Champion of the Stanford National Invitational, in the top ten at both NFL and CFL Nationals, and won many other local and national awards. I also competed, less successfully, in Extemp., LD, and the occasional interp. category (DI, OI, etc.).

My judging preferences for Student Congress are:
(1) Civility is paramount. Act like a statesman. A member who is rude will have a lot to overcome if he or she hopes to advance. 
(2) Speech. Careful use of pacing, tone, and volume are important.
(3) Debate. Active engagement with the other speakers, in terms of respectfully responding to points made and asking questions, is very important.
(4) Procedure. In good rounds, knowledge and appropriate use of procedure may be what separates a breaking member from one who does not. Incorrect use of procedure, especially by the PO, will cost in any round.

At present, I am the United States Supreme Court Fellow placed with the United States Sentencing Commission. Those interested can see the rest of my professional background on my Linkedin page.
