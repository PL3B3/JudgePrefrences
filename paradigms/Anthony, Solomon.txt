  Aff: You should always win against a disad, otherwise you should really consider remaking your aff. I love impact calc in the 2ar. Make sure to you know your aff really well and are able to answer every question the neg throws at you.

Kritikal Aff: I am all for kritikal affirmatives, I believe they are a very good way of actually discussing something different without making it an issue you can drop at any point in the debate. You guys should really stride to also have impacts based on fiat (i.e. extinction in any way possible). Also make sure your aff is topical and if it is not and the other team makes that argument, you are basically done for, unless they find away to mess it up.

Disads: I will not vote for a disad against an affirmative case, especially if their impacts outweigh. You should either make your disad impacts outweigh or a pre-requisite to their impacts.

Counter-Plans: Amazing argument. Go for it if you can.

Kritiks: Alright, I know a lot of team are in love with kritiks, but you guys need to know how to explain it really well. I personally went for Nietzche every neg round. I understand most kritiks, but if it is some kritik that just got popular cause of the topic, you need to give the kritik a lot more time and explain what the k is and then go on to tell me about how you should win. I love cap k, nietzche, Spanos, and futurism. So if it is not one of those, you might have to spend some extra time on it.

Topicality: I enjoy topicality debates, so go for it.

Theory: Never a fun debate round to be in, but if it works for you, you have to do it.

Other Random Stuff: (REALLY IMPORTANT)

*Be aggresive in cross-x, dont be mean.
*If you find a gap in the other teams argument, hit it hard.
*A dropped argument is a true a argument, no matter how stupid it is
*Make a funny pop culture reference in your speech and it will make me have a good time, also speaker points are always better this way.
*Make sure to be really clear on tag and author, also clarify when you are switching from card to card.
I like to be referred as Darth Vader or Master Anthony.
