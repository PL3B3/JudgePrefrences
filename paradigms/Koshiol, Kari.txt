  I am the head debate coach at BSM in MN, so I have watched a few practice rounds on this topic, but otherwise this is my first time judging it. Overall, I've been judging for 9 years or so, and I debated for 5 years before that. In terms of preferences, I like voters and crystallization. Tell me what to vote on, and I'll vote on that. I am a flow judge, who can keep up with speed but I don't like it. In fact, I prefer a clean debate - stand up while speaking, drop some of the over the top jargon, don't yell: just convince me why you win. I like unique arguments (be they burdens, kritiks, counterplans,whatever), but I won't buy them unless you truly prove and warrant them.
