Speed
Speak slowly and clearly. I can only write so fast, and I only flow what I hear. The quality of your arguments is more important to me that the quantity.

Time
Use all your time given up to the last second. I don't allow you to speak past the time I'm keeping though. 

Value Debate
Be sure to thread your value and value criterion throughout your case and link all arguments back to your value. 

A few more random thoughts...
1. Be sure to sign-post
2. Give voters issues in your last speech
3. Be respectful to your opponent
