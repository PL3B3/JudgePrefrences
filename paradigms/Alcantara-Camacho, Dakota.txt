  if you dont wanna read this whole thing just remember: if you debate well, i dont care what you do.

marquette high school tournament sept 18th-19th is my first experience with this topic and first experience judging championship debate. that means i have no idea or influence from what "most of the qualified people think about the topic" in general thats not convincing to me. if you're relying on those opinions you better explain them incredibly well, especially on t.

Experience: Debated in high school for four years, competed at the national policy level, went to the TOC my junior/senior year with different partners, was in the top 20 speakers at most of the national tournaments i attended my senior year. i got waxed by a lot of great debaters. and im not debating in college.
so i hopefully i wont be the most qualified judge you'll have. i do think im plenty capable though. i just hope you have someone better than me.

I need an warranted argument, with a link to that argument, from one side that hopefully has an impact and a reason why i should vote for you (they can be synonymous). impact analysis is crucial.

I probably think K literature is more true than any policy stories but I think flexibility is crucial. If you have a disad and you're waxing them on it dont be afraid to go for it. im not incredibly immersed in k lit but i used to read a lot about it in high school and went for the K most of high school.

theory debate: one of my favorite parts of debate and i think its incredibly fascinating. but if its done poorly i never ever ever want to be involved. if its not you're strong suit don't do it.

make it easy for me.

i will reward: smart decisions, funny people, people who choose not to be a jack ass, innovation

i take very seriously: intentionally hurtful speech, card clipping, cheating in general

be fair, debate well, have fun.
