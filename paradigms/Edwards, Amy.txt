  I am the parent of an active LD debater (and as he is my second son in the activity, I have been around debate tournaments for a while). I have mostly judged in other events, but have been trained in judging LD. I will take notes as best as I can, and look for good clear communication and smart argumentation with clash.

As a corporate attorney by trade, I am looking for you to make solid, coherent arguments and to develop them well throughout the round. At the same time, I want you to present them in a convincing manner that I can understand. I admit that I am not particularly experienced enough to handle speed or "spreading" well and if you do that, you may just lose me or confuse me. At the end of the round, I want you to tell me a complete story explaining why I should vote for you - crystallization is very important to me. Finally, while I enjoy a good strong debate, I do not appreciate or like when you are rude to your opponent. So, be nice and have a great time, and I will do my best to be a good, attentive judge.
