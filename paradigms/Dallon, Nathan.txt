I debated in high school at Millard West in Omaha, NE for 4 years. I did not debate in College.

Speed is fine but sign post for me and don’t move from flow to flow while blazing faster than a
YouTube speed talker.

All arguments are in. I am a smart enough person to make sense of anything you can throw at
me. If you are aff and you don’t have a plan text that is fine but know that I think that is a bad
idea. I will still vote for an advocacy that is well articulated and well argued.

Pre fiat considerations: tread wisely. If you travel to the realm of pre-fiat and hope to make a
home there you may. That being said, understand that pre fiat does not make all other things
said in the round that operate in a post fiat world disappear. That is a strange thought. The
world of pre fiat is a world of advocacy and the things that were advocated in round are still
advocacies. Does it change the impacts and function of those advocacies? Obviously. It is your
responsibility to explain those changes. Pre fiat is not a world with specific rules that you should
expect I know and adhere to. I have this strange feeling that people coach and argue pre fiat
out of laziness since there are few ‘new’ strats against these arguments. Don’t be one of those
people. Explain your arguments well, compare your advocacy to theirs and tell me why yours is
better. Do not tell me yours is the best ever and ignore everything else even if your authors do.

That is it. See you soon.
