  I will vote on almost anything. Be clear especially on tags because I don't flow well. I like theory. I flow CX.

I will enforce a slow round if at least one debater wants it (I'll say slow during speeches, heavily penalize speaks for repeated violations, and drop a debater who refuses to slow down).
