  I was an LD and policy debater for the Kinkaid School in Houston, TX. Now I'm a sophomore at Babson College in MA.

In terms of judging philosophy, I'm open to any type of argument (CP, DA, K, T, etc...) as long as you do solid impact calculus throughout the round.
For example, if running T, explain why fairness/education/etc are the most important impacts in the round rather than just claiming that they are voters.
I also tend to prefer policy impacts, but as I said earlier, I'm open to kritikal arguments as well provided that you explain how they outweigh.

NOTE for LDers: I tend to look at the standards debate first, though I will vote on apriori and theory arguments if well articulated in terms of weighing/impact analysis.

I'm OK with speed, I will try and do my best, but I would encourage you all to perhaps slow down a little bit. This can be solved somewhat with clear signposting. If there are specific pieces of evidence that the debate comes down to, I will generally try and read them over just to make sure I make the most accurate decision possible. 

I expect all debaters to be courteous and to keep track of their prep time as well.

I'm also pretty generous with speaks, and hope you all do well at your upcoming tournaments. Thanks!
