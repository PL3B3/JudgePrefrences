  I debated for four years at Walt Whitman High School, graduating in 2010. I enjoyed both TOC and CFL style debate, so feel free to use the style that makes you most comfortable. My favorite parts of debate were crafting a decision calculus and comparing argumentation. By default, I view the resolution as an action endorsed by the affirmative while the negative advocates a competing advocacy. By default, I view theory as an issue of competing interpretations. I am open to arguments that say I should look at the resolution or theory in a different way. I will not vote on any argument where I cannot adopt at least the possibility that the argument is true. This is a very low threshold, and excludes mostly arguments that are racist or that i cannot accept because I do not understand the argument.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
