  Debated for three years at La Salle College High School, have assistant coached for four years following graduation.

I like substantive debates with lots of clash and that the students are knowledgeable in. Do whatever kind of debate that you like and that best compliments your skill set.

General issues
Speed is fineNo prep time for flashing, but if you try to steal or are taking ridiculously long I’ll tell you when I start taking timeI default to tech over truthDon't be rude to your opponents.
T
T is a voting issue. The same goes for a negative framework against critical affs.I usually default to competing interpretations, but I can be persuaded on reasonability.
DA
The thing I’ll look to most on this flow is the link chain. I personally think most impacts are really bad, and most of the time the reason for that can be found in the internal linksPlease do impact calc. Yelling extinction doesn’t count
CP
CP (especially advantage CP) are great strategies if run properly. Just make sure to have a solvency advocate to back it up and to explain the net benefitsPerms are awesome. Do them.
K
If you can’t explain the thesis of what your author is talking about, don’t run that k. I’m very skeptical when students try running psychoanalysis or other complex modernist/post-modern theory. There are students who can do that, just make sure to show me that you’re one of them.I'm generally fine with whatever K you run, but I look to the link level closely. Students should explain that aspect of the debate very thoroughly
Theory
I’m more than willing to vote on theory. If you don’t warrant it out properly it’s probably not a reason to reject the team (just saying the words doesn't make it true). That being said, if I have it flowed and reasoned out that’s a round winnerI'll vote on multi condo, but single condo is going to be an uphill battle.
Ask me any specific question when I get to the room.
