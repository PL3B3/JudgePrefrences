  Debated at Brophy from 06-10. 4-3 @ TOC. Debated at Boston College, Competed at 2012 NDT.

I have debated a lot of different styles of arguments over my career, but over the last two years (while I've debated in college), I have focused most of my time on the Policy side of the Spectrum. It was not untypical for our 1NCs to be 1-2 off and Case (the 1 off either being the Politics DA, a more specific DA, or a CP with a Net Benefit).

I am a better judge for policy debates because of familiarity; however, I did spend most of my time in HS in critical debates, so I can comprehend most of those as well. Don't use buzzwords or assume I know what the third eye of Bataille is.

Have fun and be courteous.
