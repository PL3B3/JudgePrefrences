  I debated for Lexington High School for 4 years as a 2N and now I am a freshman debater at UC Berkeley. I love debate and the intellectual inquiry that goes into succeeding in a debate round.
In terms of arguments, I am open to listening to most arguments. I don't necessarily lean aff or neg on any policy arguments, including theory violations- I will vote for whomever does the better debating. I go for all sorts of arguments including kritiks, impact turns, disads, and counterplans so I have no argumentative biases.
However, against affs that don't defend a plan text, I exclusively go for topicality. Although I am open to listening to your critical aff, the neg should feel comfortable going for topicality or framework. 
Feel free to ask many any questions before the round.
