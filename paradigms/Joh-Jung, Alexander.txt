  "What is Death?"
"What are your preferred gender pronouns?" 
"Whats your favorite anime?" 
"Isn't Kaneki Ken from Tokyo Ghoul a complete bad ass anti-hero?"

I swear to God if one of those is your first Cross X question I'll probably give you bonus speaker points especially if thats the framing issue in the last rebuttal.

Since your looking at my wiki your probably curious about what my paradigm is because your reading somethings thats either a.) sketchy as hell or b.) critical as hell or c.) traditional as fuck. 
Heres a hint for how I evaluate arguments.

"Soooooo racism good was dropped, ummmmm I voted on that turn y'all dropped that gets blown up in the next speech. it turned your whole damn case, like you could have low key said "your dumb" on that turn and moved on and I would have bought it........"

I basically vote on anything. HOWEVER, if someone is intentionally being a complete racist, homophobic, sexist asswipe. I shit you not, I will drop you so fast you won't even have time to time yourself.

For my bio: go to my Facebook page. 
My debate exp:
So far as this is 2015-16 I am a Varsity 3rd year debater at ETHS. I am a K debater and I'm very familiar with most of the literature. However, if you decided to blast DNG or Baudrizzle I will probably be laughing hysterically as I vote you down post 1NC. No but really, if your a novice and your makeing those arguments I'll most likely be dropping you, because your not making the arguments that they actually argue. 



Now if you STILL want specifics on what I'm ok with.....

Framework:
Cool
T:
Cool
Theory:
Cool
K:
Cool
DA:
cool
CP:

Just win the argument.
Duly note you theory hacks: condo is a voter after the obnoxious 7off or if you have multiple piks.That shit is annoying af for me to flow and I might just drop you out of vengeance for killing the several trees that were murdered to flow that shit.
