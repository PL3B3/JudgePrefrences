  I debated for Bronx Science for 4 years. In terms of style, I am more traditional and I would prefer to see a case, but if you want to run a plan/counterplan/kritik its totally fine as long as it is well warranted and clearly explained. I can handle speed within reasonable limits. Slow down on dense philosophy and card names. If I don’t hear it, I will not vote on it. I really don’t like theory. Only run theory if there is a LEGITIMATE abuse in the round. If you must run theory, please make sure it is well justified. If it is blippy or shady, I will not give it much weight in the round.
