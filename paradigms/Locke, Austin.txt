  LD Judging Philosophy
Experience and Affiliation: 4 yrs HS debate (4 Policy, 2 PF) – Vestavia Hills. 3 yrs coaching- VHHS and Marist

Generics
a. Speed- I can do speed, but I am a bit rusty. Start slow and build to speed
 i. Slow down on the tags and authors so I can flow them
ii. Spikes and tricks should not be snuck in- if your opponent missed them, I probably did too.
 iii. CP or K alt Texts- be slow and emphasize the critical parts
iv. If you have multiple cards in a row, give me some pen time to catch up
b. Cross-x
 i. It is binding
 ii. DO NOT BE RUDE
c. Prep
i. Flashing speeches doesn’t use time- I can tell if you are stealing prep
 ii. DO NOT STEAL PREP
 iii. You may use prep however you want
d. Framework-
 i. Blank slate, BUT abusive frameworks tend to annoy me.

Theory – 4 years of policy, and we are terrible at theory debates
a. I tagline flow theory the first time I hear it if you blow through it (ex: ground, limits, education)
b. Reasonability tends to be my default of theory- providing actual examples of harm or abuse helps
c. Remember voters

K’s
a. I am not very K literate so if you are a ‘K hack’ I apologize I might not be your guy
b. Please put them on a separate sheet of paper
c. Let me know if you have framework on the K
d. If I looked confused, I probably am, so explain a bit more.

Impact Debates
a. Policy guy- I tend to like big bang impacts
b. Timeframe, magnitude, probability
c. EVEN IF STATEMENTS

Pet Peeves
a. DON’T BE RUDE
b. Please don’t call me judge more than 3 times during a single speech
c. Don’t call another teams arguments stupid- use silly, misguided, misleading, etc
d. No New in the 2
