  I'm a debate coach, but I have only been involved in debate for 2 years, so although I have some experience, I'm still a "newbie" as coaches go.

NO speed whatsoever because most people cannot spread well enough to be spreading and it becomes way too difficult to flow. If you spread to the point that I cannot understand, I will stop flowing.

BE CLEAR. Similar to speed, if I cannot understand what you are saying , I will not flow it.

Do not run theory, disads, kritiks, things of that sort, I like traditional debating so stick to it.

I would love to see some signposting and make sure you give me clear voters. (Remember, just because you give me voters doesn't mean I'll agree with you--but they are very helpful!).
