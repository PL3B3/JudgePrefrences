  I've been active in debate for nine years and competed in L-D at the local and national level.

As a debater, I disliked interventionist judges and I strive to avoid intervening in my decisions -- you can help! I vote based on standards. Establishing a standard early on and consistently impacting back to it makes the debate (and my flow) clearer, which is in your interest.
Clarity is key. You need to tell me why your arguments matter. Please do extend arguments and warrants -- but don't just blippily extend cards, tell me why they are important. Speed is not a problem as long as you are comprehensible. Be sure to weigh the round for me and provide voters.

Broader personal preferences: I enjoy arguments that display innovative, original thinking and speak to the big picture. I'm flexible and open to alternative styles. I'm willing to do what you tell me, but you have to tell me why I should do it. I dislike sleaziness and lying (i.e. new arguments in 2AR, false claims about dropped arguments).
