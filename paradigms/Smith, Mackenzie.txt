  I competed in LD throughout high school at Jack C. Hays. I'm currently a freshman at Cornell University on the Speech and Debate team as well as the Mock Trial Association. I have ample experience in public speaking and policy/political advocacy.
Concise arguments, presented clearly will get my ballot. I can understand spreading and will flow it, but you will lose speaks if I have to ask for clarity.
Traditional arguments are preferred, I like to see V and VC linkage throughout, and IMPACT IMPACT IMPACT! Tell me why I should care that your case achieves justice better.
I flow loosely and based on what you tell me to do. After the 1NC I won't be searching out anything to flow, tell me what to do!
Rebuttal speeches should be orderly and go down the flow, I won't flow it if it's not clear and you will not get my ballot.
All of this said, I can sit before you and determine who is the better debater, speaker, etc. by the way in which you carry yourself and deliver your arguments, I hope to give that person my ballot each round.
