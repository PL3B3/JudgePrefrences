Fairly high theory threshold- receptive to reciprocal abuse or reject the argument, not the team.

More likely to vote on literature based procedurals like T than other procedurals.

I like kritiks that operate in the fiat world or make framework arguments that are relevant to the topic literature. I will vote for performance, but I do think its important to explore new literature in critical theory, so please have recent link work.

I am in depth on all the topic lit and high school and college circuit kritik lit.

Any rate of delivery is fine, I'll say clear if I can't hear you.

I will probably want to read cards after the round in very competitive debates.

As far as tag team, I defer to the teams- if one team wants no tag i dont allow tag. Jumps should be in time or reasonably rapid. Jumps should occur, completely, before the speech if this is agreed by teams to preserve equal access to unredacted portions of evidence.

I lean towards seeing all arguments as conditional.
