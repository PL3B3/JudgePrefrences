  I am a fairly traditional LD judge from Schaumburg High School (IL). I prefer a slower, conversational speaking style because delivery plays a role in regard to overall persuasion; however, I feel strongly that value and criterion are required and paramount elements of a persuasive and successful case. Additionally, I highly favor cases with empirical and analytical evidence. Voting issues should absolutely be stated in final rebuttals. I encourage friendliness, wit, and charm.
