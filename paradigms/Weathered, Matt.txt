  My name is Matt, I split my three years of debating between policy and LD at alta high school in Sandy, UT. This year (09-10) is my first year judging since i graduated two years ago, and I haven't officiated too many rounds as of yet.

My thoughts on debate:
I can't say that i have a specific paradigm, and i am definitely not up to theorizing about what debate "is". Thus, in order to make your reading of this at least slightly fruitful, here are my feelings on some of the technical aspects of the activity that the home page asked me to discuss:

Speed: I can keep up with it to a moderate degree. if you go too quickly, i will give you a verbal indication
Theory: These arguments are fine, but if they are not well explained, they are just obnoxious.

Anything else, ask before round.
