  Short version: - parent judge - don't like theory - loose patients with discourtesy in round - I will not fill in argument impacts for you - I give lower speaks I have never given a thirty - NO KRITIKS - if you run theory run something else 

Long version: I am very much like a parent judge. I do not like theory. If you are going run any kind of theory argument you must run something else. I want to hear the argument not the jargon. I don't mind spreading. If I can't keep up I will call clear.
