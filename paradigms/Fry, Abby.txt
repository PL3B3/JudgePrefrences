FW-I am generally persuaded by arguments on why the aff should have to read a topical plan. Arguments like idea testing and TVOA tend to minimize the aff’s offense and I’m probably not the person you want in the back of the room if the aff wants to for impact turns to Framework. I usually leave the room after debates like these wondering what the aff does so a strategy that impacts that out and has sufficient defense might be a way for the affirmative to get my ballot in a debate like this

K-I have not read very much critical literature and this was not my thing in high school. This means use buzzwords with caution and don't assume I know what you're talking about.

T- I believe fairness is the best impact and controls most others you can think of. The quality of interp evidence is very important and should be debated on the merits of how it impacts predictability, arbitrariness, ect. Topicality is always a voter and never a reverse voting issue.

Disad-Disads are great, do impact calc and turns case early.

CP-I think counterplans have a lot of utility and that they should usually involve non-plan action. Condo is good.
