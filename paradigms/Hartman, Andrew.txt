  I debated public forum for one and a half years at Mount Si High School. I went to state twice, and attended the Tournament of Champions, where my team placed 9th out of 54 teams. The purposed of this information is not to build my ego, it is meant to give you some idea of what I like.

HOW I VOTE: I will vote based on what you say in the final focus. Nothing more. The final focus should give me a way to look at the round, and tell me about the important issues.



I would enjoy to see debates that include the following:

Evidence analysis (calling for cards). Dig through their evidence and find holes. Every card has a weakness, and finding it will impress me. Be sure if you call for a card to actually use it!
Reasonable speed. Your speaker points will be very high if you can speak at a quick pace and give good presentation.
Weighing. Go beyond explaining why you win or lose points, explain why those points you won matter most. Even if you think you've won all point in the round, you rarely will on my flow.
Humor. I enjoy some lightheartedness in the round, and if you make me laugh you'll see your speaker points go up. DO NOT let it get in way of the debate, though.
Responsiveness. This will make my choice MUCH easier when I sign my ballot. Don't simply tell me your opponent is wrong, tell me why!! For example, explain why their rebuttal is non-responsive, explain why their argument is wrong. PLEASE DO NOT end clash after the rebuttal speech. You should keep arguing up until the final focus, not simply restating your case.


I do not want to see the following:

Spreading. Just don't. Seriously.
Hounding for evidence. I enjoy seeing people use evidence effectively, don't abuse this by calling for things you don't have to.
