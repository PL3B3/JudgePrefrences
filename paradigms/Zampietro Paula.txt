  I debated at Gulliver Prep for 4 years. My coaches were Stephen Pipkin, Robert Holmes, and Gus Eyzaguirre so a lot of my views on debate were influenced by them. (This isn’t going to be comprehensive more like a quick few tips so if there’s something specific you want to know either see their philosophies or email me at pzamp94@gmail.com.)

A few quick things:
1) I prefer da/cp debate, but I’ll listen to and vote for anything as long as its clear and well explained.
2) I can be persuaded to vote either way on conditionality, but make sure the debate is clean and not blippy and full of “buzz-words”.
3) Flow. I will too.
4) I like topicality, but these debates can go downhill very fast. Make sure you explain why your interpretation is better for debate. Don’t just say “limits” or “ground”. And have relevant evidence that actually supports whatever you’re saying. This is generally a good thing for other arguments as well.
5) Speak clearly. Being fast isn’t more important than being understandable.
6) Impact calc is important.
7) Have fun and don’t be an asshole.
