  I was a policy debater in high school for Monticello High School in New York. In college and grad school I briefly coached LD and judged a few times. I only judge sporadically at this point, so please do not assume I know more than the wording of the resolution.

I have no particular preferences for either LD or policy. I will vote for any argument that wins the round. Critiques, theory, etc. are all fine. Also, speed is fine.
