  Hi, I'm Vincent. I debated in high school and three years for UGA - never was very good at it.

I've historically massively preferred kritiks for my own debating style, but this doesn't preclude my listening to policy arguments and I have a decent amount of exposure to policy arguments debating for Georgia. Nor does it mean that reading a kritik in front of me is an auto-win. It just means that my value system frequently finds itself aligned with kritikal leaning debate and I am much more conversant with the terminology.

Otherwise I don't think that I have strong proclivities.
