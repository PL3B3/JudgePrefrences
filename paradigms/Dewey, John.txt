Background:

Claremont High School 2006
Art Center College of Design (BFA in Fine Arts) 2011

I was a debater / speech student at Claremont High School for 4 years from 2002-2006.

I've been out of the debate community for a while now, so I'm not up to speed on your topic specific acronyms.

I enjoy both traditional policy and kritik/performance debate. My training in Fine Art / Art History involved a lot more study of postmodern/modernist philosophy than it did in classical philosophy, so i'm more familiar with postmodern K lit than I am with most other types. I still have a pretty strong foundation in enlightenment / modern philosophers.

I'm open to any type of argument / strategy, just try to stay away from arguments like 'racism good' (most '___-ism good' arguments of this type aren't a good idea in front of me)

Because I've been away from debate for a few years now, please speak slightly slower than you would in front of your judges that are at every tournament during the year. Especially if you get me during round 1 or 2, as my ear has to re-acclimate to spreading. 

Any other questions, feel free to ask me pre-round.
