  I'm a parent judge and more traditional type. I'd like to see the debaters engage and clash on topics and issues, because I believe that's the best way to reap the educational benefit of the debate activity. 

I'm open to all kinds of creative arguments as well, including theory debate. However I think there should be certain [[#|degree]] of risk involved in these creative debate techniques. Just throwing out a copycat of theory shell won't get you pass a round, if there is no obvious abuse from you opponent and there's no evidence that you can't defend your position without invoking the theory.
