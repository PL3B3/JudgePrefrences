  Background: My name is Brittany Bolger and I am a Policy Debater at the University of Central Florida. I debated in the Varsity division throughout high school mostly as an LD debater, but also as PF and Congress. 

I have a strong preference for arguments that are clear and well extend across the flow. 

I don't mind spreading, as long as I can clearly understand you, and I will say "clear" if I can not. I also prefer to have speech docs in front of me as well so an email chain is preferred. 

Theory: I don't mind it, as long as you realize its your burden to help me understand it and lay it out for me to weigh. 

Cards: I hold cards to the standard you tell me to unless the credibility is disputed by the other side.

I also want to see clash in a debate. That is the whole point of this discursive activity. 

Also, please be responsible and track your own prep time. I will be doing it as well but don't count on me to do it for you. 

Lastly, a role of the ballot in your last speech is pertinent. Tell me, the judge, what to vote on and what to weigh (impact calculus). I go into these debates with a clear mind and only weigh what you tell me to.
