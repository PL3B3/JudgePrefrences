  I have been judging for more than two years as a debater's parent. I am a mechanical engineer by training and have a graduate degree too. As a debate judge, I am looking for clarity, facts and logic used to support the assigned arguments. Good speakers are always helpful, but not everything to win. Fairness is the key to me on giving out the points as I understand debaters are working very hard to prepare their debate. I strongly encourage debaters are not giving not easily even when you do not have a good starting point. Persistence will lead you win over the audiences.
