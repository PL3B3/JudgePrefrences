  I did two years of policy and LD, respectively. Anything goes, really. I believe in tabula rasa judging.

I’m willing to listen to kritiks, theory, and any other types of arguments but tailor them for LD as necessary.

The Value/Criterion debate is very crucial. Whichever value/criterion I choose to accept, based on debaters’ argumentation and warrants, will absolutely dictate how I judge the round.

Make sure the arguments you make are sound, well articulated, and always explicitly relevant to the value debate. Tell me the most important voting issues in the round and why I should view them as such.

The round is yours so do with it what you will, so long as you leave me a clear lens with which to evaluate the debate.
