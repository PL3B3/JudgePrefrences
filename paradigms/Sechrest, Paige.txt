  My debate experience is three years of LD and parli in high school as well as a year and a half of NPDA. I'm open-minded in terms of kritiks and weird arguments, although I won't evaluate those impacts first unless you tell me why I should. I am comfortable with theory in policy debate, which means that if you have me as a judge in LD, be on the safe side and slow down and explain your arguments well; assuming you do that, I'm willing to vote on those arguments. I am willing to vote on potential abuse if you tell me why I should. I'm pretty fine with speed - I don't anticipate it being an issue, but if it is I'll say "clear." I try to be tab - I want you guys to do your thing.
