Experience: 4 years of policy debate in high school. Debated at the NAUDL National Tournament
 
General stuff: While I’m familiar with policy debate as a whole, I have zero experience with this year’s resolution. I don’t know any details about China, so both the aff and the neg need to do a good job contextualizing their arguments and explaining them. More specifically, the neg needs to make sure that their links are VERY clear. Personally, I’m more of a policy debater than a K debater, but I’m willing to vote for anything. However, if you ARE running a K you need to make sure that you explain it very well.
 
DAs: Just make sure that your links are specific to the aff! I love warrant heavy uniqueness and link debates.
 
Ks: Just be clear with your explanations. You need to be able to explain your arguments to someone with little to no background knowledge. I’ve definitely run Ks before, but I’m really only familiar with cap, anthro, and ecofem.
 
T/Theory: I’m willing to vote on these, but you need to either a. prove in round abuse or b. do a really good job explaining why potential abuse matters.
 
Speaking: I’m generally good with speed, but I’m a little rusty. I haven’t heard spreading in a while, so start slow and then speed up. Don’t just start your speech at your top level speed. Also, be loud and clear. I will say clear, but not more than once or twice per speech. Remember faster doesn’t equal better! Also, there’s a fine line between being assertive and being rude. Try not to cross it.
 
Flashing: I don’t take prep time, BUT don’t steal prep. You’re not being sneaky. Trust me.
