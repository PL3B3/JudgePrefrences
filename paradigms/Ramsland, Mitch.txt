  I debated for two years for the Hopkins LD team. I've also judged rounds every year since entering college.

I judge like most college students, and will listen to any position you present to me with an open mind. I have trouble handling speed these days since I haven't judged on the circuit for quite some time. This is important because I will not yell clear, and I will not extend arguments if they are not clearly written on my pad from your first speech or rebuttal. I have very little preference on how you win the round, but I will not preclude the AC or NC or vote off an apriori if it is not well developed and clearly won on the flow.

Any other questions you may have can be asked before the round.
