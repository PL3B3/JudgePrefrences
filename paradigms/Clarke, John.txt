  I am a former CUNY debater who recently graduated. I was in the college circuit for at least two and a half years and have some experience as an open debater. I am currently coaching CUNY. I use to run close to every argumentation when I debated so I vote on any argument, as long as you give me a reason to vote for it. My favorite argument is theory, but you will have to show me how that particular argument was impacted in the round. I'm not so much a fan of framework; a debate round becomes boring for me if it comes all the way down to framework, but that doesn't mean I won't vote on it if I feel it was not answered properly by the other team.
