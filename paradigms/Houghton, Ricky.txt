Strike me if you spread, because I will NOT be able to understand or flow you. I am most familiar with the value/value criterion model. I will make a better decision if the framework is really clear. If you are going to do anything policy-like, pref me low because I am not familiar with policy. DO NOT RUN THEORY. Also I see theory as a call for judge intervention, so if you run it, you probably won't be happy with the decision. I value politeness and professionalism in a round. I vote off of the flow, so go line by line if you can.
