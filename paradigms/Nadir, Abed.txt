  I’ve watched a couple friends do debate while in Community college. Honestly, it makes as little sense to me as life does.

I don’t understand reality. It makes no sense to me. However, television does. I would therefore request that you make the debate round all in terms of tv and pop culture references.

Thus, I like to think of debate rounds as mini lawyer films. I will therefore imagine the participants in the rounds as the prosecutor and the defense. During your speeches, please dramatically bang your fists on the tables and pace around the room in circles as if you were pleading insanity for your client. Insert classic lawyer lines into your speech, such as “I can neither confirm nor deny that” and “My client has no memory of that.” These will earn you more speaker points in round.

I prefer references to Quentin Tarantino films and will give bonus points to those who do creative skits while the round occur. These may involve krumping, dressing up as Christmas trees, or acting like there are imaginary stairs in the room. Also, I would definitely prefer if you dress up as people of famous film origin. They can be of any time period, or of independent films. I keep an open mind to what I watch. 

If my friend Troy is in the room, please do NOT wear a LeVar Burton costume. I will automatically vote you down if you do so.

And of course, the best arguments are META-ARGUMENTS. Make sure to bring up how the debate round would change if it were a tv show. Try to integrate romance into the round, but make it quick. I don’t have all day. If you want, I can bring a priest with me and a George Clooney impersonator. Please use tap dancing whenever possible.

I will vote for whoever links the round best to television. (Note: television encompasses all movies and television shows)

Note: I will be filming these rounds for my movie.
