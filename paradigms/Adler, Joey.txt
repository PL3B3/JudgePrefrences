  I have been involved in every form of debate except Policy. So I have seen it all! Or so I like to think =P. I will be judging Public Forum mostly this year so I supposed I should tell you a little bit about what I am going to be looking for.

What I ask is that you can logically argue your points. The whole point of your case is to convince me that your right and your opponent are wrong. If your arguments are not logical then they do nothing for you. I also look for good analysis of the arguments your making. In general make sure you understand the argument your presenting and that its logically sound.

Your case should have evidence to back up your arguments but not fully driven by it. Evidence will not only help convince me but also help strengthen your case against your opponent cases.

The point of debate is to have a clash, so make sure that there is an argument. Very key to winning is to make me believe your opponent is wrong and your right.  Basically make sure that you are organized, your arguments make since, and that you actually debate your opponent.
