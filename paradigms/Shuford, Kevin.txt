  I am a Civics and Economics Teacher at Enloe High School, and have previously studied law. 

This is my second year judging LD debate, and I have only done so in the North Carolina circuit-which means I am used to traditional, values style debate. Do not run a value of morality on me and give no justification and move on. If you are going to speak fast, do it at your own risk--I am not accustomed nor plan to be accustomed to any type of spreading. 

Secondly, be very clear regarding your arguments, be slow and explicit on contention tag lines and outline to me why your impacts are relevant in the round. Make it apparent that these impacts will actually happen, as I will not vote off obscure links such as links to extinction. I want a clear debate showing the applicability of the aff world in society and not an entirely hypothetical one. 

Make the clash very obvious. I don't want any type of progressive debate including theory-if there is abuse in the round, then read the abuse as if it was in your rebuttal. I need to have a clear way to decide the winner. 

Speaking: Speak slow and clear, I want actual debate and not just argument spewing. I generally will give mid to high speaks as long as you are being clear to me and your opponent. Do not be sarcastic, use foul language, or be abrasive to a first time debater--i'll probably give you a 24 for that. 


Finally, have fun! Debate is an intellectual and ENGAGING activity that everyone should be included in and ought to feel part of.
