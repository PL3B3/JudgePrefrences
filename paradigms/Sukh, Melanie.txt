  Would prefer debaters speak at a normal pace - very fast speech is difficult to digest. Simply conveying more information in a shorter period of time won't help if I can't process it. Courtesy and decorum at all times Debaters should let me know if they want time signals, I'll be happy to oblige I'm a bit of a stickler on timing, debaters should plan to manage their time well as I will cut them off when time runs out It bears repeating that a few well thought out arguments will always trump many insubstantial points - i.e. I'm looking for substance, not bulk If debaters can't refute their opponents criticism of their points then in my opinion they haven't made their case. I'm looking for cases/debaters that can stand up to a challenge.
