Experience: 2015-2016 is my fourth year judging Lincoln-Douglas Debate; I am the parent of a debater who competes on the national circuit.

General:

I learned everything I know about debate being the parent of a progressive debater, so while I can understand your arguments and spreading (if you're clear), please keep this in mind. I am not well-read in philosophy, nor do I keep very detailed flows. I will probably just flow the tags or the gist of your arguments, so be convincing and tell me a clear ballot story.

Overall, I prefer more traditional arguments. I can understand some speed, but only when you maintain a strict clarity. You can run K's, counterplans, other progressive elements, but please just be clear and explain the argument to me after you've read it. As a parent, I don't understand all the jargon and may not know how arguments function unless you tell me.

Theory:

I believe theory is for checking abuse. If you want to run theory, you must show me why your opponent is being abusive and why you should win. If I do not understand the abuse story, I will not vote for theory. Please keep this in mind.

Miscellaneous:

Weighing, collapsing down the the important issues in the 2AR/2NR, and generally refraining from a messy debate will both help me decide the clear winner and help you as a debater.

In general, be polite to your opponent (rudeness of any form is strongly discouraged) and ---especially because debate is a speaking event--- present your arguments well and be persuasive.

If you ever have further questions, feel free to talk to me either before or after a round.
