  Classic/Policy Judge: Debated Policy for 2 years, debated LD for 2 more, and qualified for States every year. Now I help coach team debate for Rancho Bernardo High School.

I highly detest debaters who use jargon and speed as a crutch. Intelligence is dressed in word economy and purposeful organization. Don't fit a ten minute speech in six minutes. Explain your position succinctly without simplifying or sacrificing the power of your argument.

You are here to debate. You. Not your evidence. Not your philosopher. All the research you did to prepare for the round is to help you craft YOUR case. Do not let the evidence or your philosopher debate your case for you. It will be obvious during cross-ex. If your warrant is just two sentences, your argument is weak or you clearly do not understand your claim. Please feel free to supply two or three warrants to strengthen your point.

Refutations deserve the same attention as contentions. Claim-Warrant-Impact.
Extensions should expand the debate, not rehash what was just said.

Rebuttals are reserved for crystallization, so do not just flow the round. I already have the flow in front of me. Review the Weighing Mechanism and Voting Issues. Always be working toward the end game.

Definitions/Topicality/Kritiks: Debaters never invest enough time in them. If you run "a priori", it better be the first thing you say every time you stand up and you better commit at least a full minute each time. That being said, there is nothing more brilliant than a well executed "a priori".

Know that I am well acquainted with the topic. Uniqueness will get you far.

Disposition: Never insult your opponent. Don't waste our time telling us what points were dropped. Misrepresentation will not be tolerated. Hyperboles, exaggerations, and extreme words make you sound unreasonable. The debater closer to the center almost always wins. Humor trumps all.
