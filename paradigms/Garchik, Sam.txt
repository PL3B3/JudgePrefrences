  I was a mediocre policy debater in the early 90s for two years. I like constitutional warrants. I can handle flow, but I prefer argument and persuasiveness over speed.

Don't make me feel like I'm choosing between Clinton and Trump. Use some sophisitcation to convince me think I'm the dumbest guy in the room. Even though I can understand it, I don't like overly complicated jargon (ie the phrase "Non-Inherent T-Shell") that's exclusive to debate. On the other hand, I used to run a lot of counter-plans in policy, so go big or go home with the squirrel and K. Plus, it warms my heart when a team can link a nuclear war impact to a contention. 

I really like a lot of debate clash, specifically about evidence. I don't always ask for evidence, but when I do, I ask to see the entire, original, uncut card. I am not a fan of teams throwing knee-jerk requests for evidence at the opposition. I also think its a good idea to have all evidence printed out. I don't flow cross, so if you get ideas for an argument, bring it up in speeches. 

Lastly I've been doing this for a few years. Let me judge the round and determine the pacing of the experience. Please don't tell me what to do outside of the rhetoric within your speeches. And for heaven's sake, be respectful to people, both within and without the round.
