I believe in traditional LD, which includes value and value criterion. If your cases lack these, you still must answer your opponents. If you have a cases structured different than the typical LD case, you MUST tell me where it is to be flowed. I will buy any argument, just remember to warrant it. 
Be careful about speed, I can handle it, but there is a such thing as too fast. I have seen really good debaters lose because they went faster than their judge had asked for. 
Finally, I always appreciate humor in a debate round, and I dislike rudeness. If you are rude, it will make it really difficult to vote for you. Your speaker points will be docked, and you might lose the round. Just remember to be polite and courteous to your opponent. Both debaters should enjoy the experience of being in the round.
