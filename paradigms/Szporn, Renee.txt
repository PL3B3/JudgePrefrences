Background: I was a policy debater in high school. I am currently a high school debate coach at Princeton High School. I am a special education teacher and I have a masters degree in special education from Rider University. I am currently a doctoral candidate in Educational Psychology at Rutgers University.

Debate Philosophy:
I like fewer well reasoned points. Sometime you see a deliberate plan throw as many arguments out as possible and hope the other side can't
speak fast enough to counter. But I would prefer fewer well-reasoned arguments spoken at a reasonable speed.
I've seen some people try off-the-wall arguments to attack a case. While an argument that depends on what the meaning of the word is is will leave your opponent
flat-footed, cases built on non-standard interpretations of the topic usually leave me unsatisfied.
I am most impressed by a well constructed defense to an unusual attack. This shows either a great deal of foresight in anticipating an unusual argument, or the
ability to think on your feet.Speak clearly and try to make eye contact with the judges. That shows you are aware of the environment around you and not just
reading from a teleprompter. If you can learn to make eye contact, then you can read the general response of the room to your argument. This feedback will show
you which arguments you should emphasize and which are not taking hold.
