  Hi I debated for San Marino HS for four years on the local and national circuit, graduating in June 2014. (Currently a freshman in college.)
Arguments: 1. Anything goes. I won't drop you for making any specific/'offensive'/stupid/silly argument or kind of argument.

2. That said, if you're not making the warrant/impact of the argument clear, I'm not evaluating it. For any issue you want me to be voting for you on, I hope to hear why it matters and why your argument is true in your last speech.

3. I like to hear framework debate > other levels (theory/pre-fiat, contention level) but that is just a preference and won't impact speaks or my decision. I'm letting you know because it was the layer of debate that I was most comfortable with in HS.

4. If one side weighs arguments/explains argument interaction/crystallizes etc and the other side doesn't, I'm gonna go with the side that did. If neither sides gives a complete picture of the round, or the priority of arguments is unclear even after weighing, I will reason through it myself while keeping my weighing consistent with what has been said.
Speed: I was never the fastest debater, and there were rounds where I simply couldn't keep up. After half a year out of debate, there's no way I've improved. Don't go at your top speed, please. And if your less-than-top speed is still too fast, I will call 'slow.' If you are unclear I will call 'clear.' I will do it once or twice and then stop if you haven't gotten better.

If you can win a debate against someone with both of you at 350 words per minute, you should be able to win it at when you're both at 250 words per minute and at 150 words per minute.
I don't have a set range for how I would give out speaks, but I will average at 28.

Bonus - I will bump you to 30 speaks if you include a clever League/Starcraft/Hearthstone reference or analogy (and don't mess up too badly elsewhere, of course).
