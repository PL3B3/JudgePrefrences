I debated for 3 years in high school (policy and public forum).

Speaks - the basics: speak clearly and loudly. That's all I ask. I'm fine with speed, but if you start to spread unintelligibly, I'll only warn you the first time. Any unintelligible arguments beyond that point will not be flowed. 

Cards - don't just read cards; explain them. If you read cards without knowing what they're saying, don't expect me to fill in the blanks and just give you the round.

Totally cool with K, counterplans, T, whatever you want to throw out there, but PLEASE do not get petty with Topicality and only run Theory if you feel like it is really necessary.

I'm a very unbiased judge - I'll vote on anything as long as it is argued well.
