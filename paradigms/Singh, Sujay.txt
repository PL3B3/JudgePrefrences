  I debated for Del Mar Independent and Torrey Pines High School for 3 years on the circuit. I've taught at VBI LA and NSD. I coach and am conflicted from Lynbrook and Christopher Columbus JN.

Debate how you want to, whatever you do best is what I want to see. The way I write my ballot is how you tell me to, granted you still make arguments (with a conclusion following from a premise) and that I can flow you. 


Trigger Warnings
Please give content warnings before the round/your speech.
If your opponent didn't do that and anything in round is making you feel legitimately uncomfortable, knock 3 times on your desk loud enough so that I can hear it and the round will be paused.

Speaks
I assign speaks based on efficiency, strategy, argument quality, and altogether how much I enjoyed watching you debate.
Youâ€™ll get less than a 27 if you say something offensive. I will try to average a 28.5. 


Have fun and good luck!
