  I'm a parent judge, and I have been judging Lincoln Douglas for about 2 years. However, I don't have much experience, so here are a few things to keep in mind:

Please don't run theory. I'll have no idea how to evaluate it, so it will only confuse me.

I appreciate a debate of the topic. Simpler philosophies are fine, but I don't much of any philosophy, so more complex ones will be very difficult for me to evaluate. On the contention level, please have plausible arguments. I don't find arguments like "the topic leads to nuke war, nuke war causes extinction" to be very plausible, so I won't find it as a persuasive argument.

I enjoy good clash, so please do very clear weighing.

Fast speech needs to be understandable, so please do not go much faster than conversational pace. No "spreading" please. Also, please speak very clearly and persuasively, as I believe those are important qualities in LD.

Lastly, please don't press me on the decision - I'm a parent so I don't have much experience, getting extremely heated and flaming me is rather rude, and I can't change the ballot so you will just make yourself feel bad once you realize that were yelling at a parent.
