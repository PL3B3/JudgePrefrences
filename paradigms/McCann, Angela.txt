  I am an honors/AP English teacher, and I've been judging the following speech and debate events since August 2015: LD, PF, Congress, Duo Interp, Extemp, OO, and Informational. With debate, I appreciate a well-organized, traditional, yet insightful argument; spreading is discouraged as I may miss your pertinent points. Please remain professional and focused in order to prove your case in a mature and convincing manner.
