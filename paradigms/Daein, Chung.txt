  I am a parent judge and this is my second year from judging Policy and LD.
Please refrain from spreading, especially when you get into more complex arguments, will be harder for me to keep up with.Please make sure you define all obscure words and explain them clearly.I tend to weigh on 'countering' so please do your best to knock out all of opponent's arguments.Being rude will make you lose speaker points, and if excessive, I will vote against you. 
I will not disclose a result.
