  I am a tabula rasa judge. I want the debaters to establish the parameters of the debate and to tell me where to vote. Please be mindful, if you do not tell me where to vote, I will default to my own mechanisms. I'll listen to any and all arguments, and I will vote on any argument. You weight the round for me. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask.
