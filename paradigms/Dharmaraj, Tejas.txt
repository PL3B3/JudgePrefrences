  Updated for 2017 ASU Tournament:

I debated LD for 4 years for Chandler High in AZ, and I had some policy experience there as well. I'm now on the parliamentary debate team at Johns Hopkins, but don't actively compete. If you have questions, refer to Christian Tarsney's paradigm. If it's something specific, shoot me an email at tejas (dot) dharmaraj (at) gmail (dot) com. I expect debaters to have read the paradigm before the round so we can help run the tournament in a timely fashion.

General
- No judge is completely tab, but like most judges, I try to be.
- I'll rarely call for a card unless it's heavily contested in round/I think you're blatantly misconstruing what it says.
- Will actively dock you for disclosure theory unless it's "must disclose plan text."
- Shaking your opponent's hand is encouraged. No need to shake my hand.

Etiquette
- Flash docs or pass papers. Having your opponent look over your shoulder is not an acceptable substitute for flashing/passing papers. Bring your own flash drives/AirDrop/etc.
- Be respectful
- Good humor and eloquence are appreciated
- I won't disclose speaks

Speed
- I'm fine with it. Start at 75% of your max and ramp it up.
- Don't go any faster than you can be perfectly clear. If someone walked into the room and asked me what you just said, I should be able to repeat your last sentence verbatim.
- Iâ€™ll call clear once before docking speaks. When I call "clear," slow down and maintain a slower pace for the remainder of your speeches. If you fail to slow down, then it's safe to assume I'm missing things.
- Side note: if I'm not flowing at that very moment, it doesn't necessarily mean I didn't catch what you're saying. You might have made your point already.
Reminder: slow down for tags, author names, interps, texts (plans, CP, alt), and for dense, nonintuitive arguments. Take a brief pause when you switch between flows on the line-by-line and pause to differentiate the end of a card and the next tag. 

Framework
- Framework is comparative.
- For philosophical debates focused on normative framework, show the differences in ethical paradigms and make convincing analytical arguments. For empirical debates, make lots of weighing arguments and good evidence comparison.
- Please read framework with your Ks and DAs, I won't default to any ethical theory.
- If you both spend half your speeches arguing justice vs. morality

Theory
- I don't mind strategic use of T/Theory, but still making a convincing abuse story.
- I default to competing interps, RVIs, and drop the argument unless you convince me otherwise. Defaults are just that, evaluatory frameworks that I will defer to in the absence of a reason not to.
- I meets are terminal defense.
- Cross applications from K to theory are interesting/should be made if possible. E.g. argue that the conception of fairness or education is framed from the dominant powers perspective and hence should be rejected in favor of something else.
- I'm pretty unlikely to vote on NIBs bad theory, especially if it's run on a single NIB. You have to keep in mind that meta-ethics and pretty much every layered bit of defense and offense functions like a NIB in the round. However, I'm more open to "Multiple NIBs bad" and the higher the number, the more open I am.

Ks, K affs, etc.
- I was a K debater: I enjoy well-run K's, and I hate poorly run K's.
- Slow down if it's dense or unusual.
- Have a real K alt.
- Micropolitical resistance probably isn't what you think it means.
- I enjoy good RotB args.
- Pretty well-versed with various K lit but it's still your job to explain it from the ground up.

Perms
- Are strictly a test of competition, not a shift of advocacy. Not sure why I have to include this, but this seems to be an issue at every tournament I judge.

Have fun, and make the round educational and enjoyable for all of us.
