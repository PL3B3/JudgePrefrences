  
I consider myself very traditional, but open to most arguments. Unless otherwise convinced, I will evaluate the round based on the preferable standard and who better impacts back to that standard.
I debated policy in high school and college. Coached over 15 years.
Delivery/Speed
I do believe a well developed argument is more important than persuasive skills.
I don’t mind an increased paced round, but find it hard to follow an immensely super fast round. I am old. If I can’t flow the argument, you will not win it. I do resent speed used a strategy to simply win when it is unnecessary. I will say clear or put my pen down if you are too fast.
I do like a good tech.nical round. Please reference arguments to the flow.
Argumentation
Pre-standards: There must be a clear reason as to why it is a pre-standard and developed.
Other: I am open to K, T, CP, DA, and theory. Theory should only be ran when there is real abuse occurring.
Post-modernism: Don’t assume I am familiar with your author. Given that clarity is imperative.
Rebuttals: Weigh arguments and give me a clear decision calculus. Don’t make me work – you might not like the work I have to do for you.
