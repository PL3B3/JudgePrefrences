  I debated in LD for The Bronx High School of Science for 4 years on the national circuit. I graduated in 2015, and I qualified to the TOC in my senior year. I currently coach for Des Moines Valley High School. 

Paradigmatically, I'm pretty similar to Carolyn Lau and Daiya Massac. Abhi Ellisetty See them, although I will post a longer paradigm shortly, because there may be some differences, so here's the short version for now. 

Short Version:

- In terms of the arguments I like to hear, I will rank them as follows: 
Kritiks > Larp > Framework > Traditional Debate 
- Don't run moral skepticism against a K. Just don't do it or I will give you the worst speaks ever. 
- Slow down on tag names and cards
