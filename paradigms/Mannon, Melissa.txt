  I debated for three years in Texas. My area was fairly traditional (stock issues debate) but I'm very open to the progressive style. I have exposure, but limited experience with spreading/kritiks/counterplans. That said, I want to learn about them. Above all else, I want to hear good arguments.

Specifically:

Topicality: great. Neg has to win the standards debate, and that there's some reason to vote on the argument.

Theory: if you're going to run it, run it to win on it.

Disads: love them. Have good internal links.

Kritiks: I'll listen to them. I don't have a lot of experience with them, but I like them. If you run it, you'd better understand it.

Counterplans: I'll listen to them. Sometimes they're great options, but don't run them if you couldn't potentially win with it.

Notes:

I like good case debate. If an argument blatantly doesn't make sense, then point it out to me. 

If you can tell that I'm not interested in what you're saying, don't spend five minutes on it. 

Warrant all of your arguments--make me believe you, and you'll win.
