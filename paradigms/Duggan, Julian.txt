I was a PF debater for two years, debated at NCFLs, UPenn Liberty Bell Classic, and GMU Patriot Games Classic. 

Philosophical, esp. moral, arguments welcome/preferred. Make the causal links clear, stay in framework. I like an easy flow. Presentation not as important as argument quality.

I don't mind speed, but don't go crazy. I'll let you know if you're going too fast.
