  I am a current junior at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, NY. My HS experience was in Policy, debating locally in the Denver Metro area, and in the western/midwestern portion of the national circuit (Berkeley, Alta, Omaha, etc). I went for the critique on both sides throughout high school and have a good understanding of most popular K lit. Despite being most versed in critical debate, I will vote on any argument if it is debated well and is non-oppressive (this includes small procedurals like ASpec, etc). I have no patience for anti-black, anti-queer, settler-colonialist, etc. speech and this will be reflected in the ballot. 
Competitive equity is very important to me. I have no qualms voting on disclosure theory if there's a significant resource imbalance. As with any argument, there still has to be an impact.

I tend to evaluate truth over tech.

Please be to the round on time. All CX should be open. Clarity is crucial. Sign post. Flashing/email will not count as prep unless its egregious. I would like to be on the email chain: dlevin1@gm.slc.edu.

I'm usually pretty generous with speaks, but I'll have a higher standard for varsity rounds than JV or novice.
