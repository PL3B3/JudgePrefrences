  I'm not a big fan of speed as I believe debate should be a listening activity. I'm not very familiar with theory but if you break it down for me as a regular argument that would be great. Please make it explainable and weigh it so that I can have an easier time understanding how the arguments engaged. K's should be explained very thoroughly. I have two years of experience judging Lincoln Douglas but it has been in the JV division. The bottom line is if I don't understand it, I'm not voting off it. Your job as the debater is to explain the arguments you make.
