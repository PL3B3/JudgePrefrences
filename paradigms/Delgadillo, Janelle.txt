  I'm kind of rusty on my flowing, and a little out of the loop on the topic since I haven't coached/judged for a while, so you're gonna have to take it easy on me in terms of speed and topic-specific jargon/concepts.

I debated in policy and did IEs for three years at Hunter High School more than 3 years ago, and judged around in Utah for about 2 years after that.

I'll hear out just about any argument, as long as there is some sort of framework for me to figure out how it fits into the round.
Otherwise, I'll sort of default to a "traditional" policy framework.

I'm not sure what paradigm issues are of interest, but feel free to ask questions before the round in the room or shoot me an email beforehand and I'll do my best to give you a clear picture of how I'd evaluate certain arguments you're considering running, etc. I'll update this page throughout the tournament based on the kinds of questions I get asked.

If you have any questions about previous rounds feel free to email me at janelledelgadillo at gmail dot com
