  I believe that Lincoln-Douglas debate is an exercise in effective communication, argument, and defense to the lay person. I'm looking for reasonable arguments, convincing defense, and professional, polite attitudes. I'm not a fan of kritiks, but when I get them, I look for how the debaters adapt to the change in the nature of the argument. Please speak at a moderate speed. If I can't keep up, then I can't flow your arguments. I usually judge after a long day of teaching, and it helps if you speak at a rate that a tired brain can follow. 
I basically choose the debater who defends their case most logically, efficiently, and professionally.
