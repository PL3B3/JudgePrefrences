  3rd year varsity debater at West Bloomfield High School in Michigan

i will listen to pretty much anything y'all have to say and i will adapt to whatever y'all wanna do -- i am good for both policy and k debate. i am not against listening to any arguments or style of debate. i truly enjoy well done K/CP debates but am totally down to listen to a really awesome T or DA debate.

k affs -- totally fine, like i said before i will listen and adapt to any style/args you wanna read

k's -- these are pretty awesome. I'm usually really good for k literature, do NOT take this as me saying you don't have to explain what you're saying. i still expect you to explain every argument you're making in order for me to vote on it.

da/cp/t -- all of these are also fine with me, i really like case specifics for all of these arguments. i usually won't buy potential abuse as an argument i don't think reading t is potentially abusive -- feel free to read it but i think it needs to be proven really really well in order for me to give it as much weight as you want it to

theory -- i really am not a huge fan of theory, but if it's completely dropped ill probably buy it for whatever reason. but if it's explained and impacted really well then we will see what happens.

i think that all arguments need to be well explained for me to vote on anything -- that goes for any style of debate

tech > truth 

-- side note DO NOT be obnoxiously rude, i WILL dock your speaks, i think there's a fine line between sassy and rude

don't call me judge (please and thank you) -- my name's Madde and i promise i don't bite :)
