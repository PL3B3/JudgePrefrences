  Although I am a "parent judge", this will be my fourth year judging Lincoln-Douglas debate.

Here are just a few of my preferences:
1. Speed is fine as long as the arguments are clear. I will motion to you in a round if you are going to fast.
2. Speaker points are a reflection of both content and delivery, but with more of an emphasis on delivery. There has been one time where I have awarded fewer speaker points to the winner of the round.
3. Please stand during the round.
4. I prefer that the debaters refrain from speaking to me once the round has begun. If you have any questions, please ask them before the round begins or after the round is over. 
5. I will not disclose at the end of the round.
