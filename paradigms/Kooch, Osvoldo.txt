  This is my 6th year judging. My son was a state and national LD debater and my daughter is a current Varsity LD debater. I am a parent judge who follows arguments (I flow), thinks critically and expects students to be able to do so too. I judged 5 rounds of PF on this same topic @ Logan, so I've heard the standard arguments. I like debaters to have clear communication, good evidence and examples, and to be civil during their rounds. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't seem to me like they focus on the main question being asked in the resolution. Clash is central to BOTH sides of the debate. My pet peeve is shout-over in crossfire. Give and take! Make it clear where you are going with a question.
