  Background: I was a Lincoln-Douglas debater for three years at South Anchorage HS in Anchorage, AK. My circuit was mostly traditional, but I have attended national tournaments such as NCFL and Arizona State. As a result, I have a working knowledge of certain national circuit concepts. I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania that occasionally judges LD and PF.

Lincoln-Douglas Paradigm

How I Evaluate the Round: I start by looking at the framework debate and seeing who wins that debate. Then, I evaluate the contention-level debate through the winning framework and determine a winner from there. I tend to focus on the issues that both debaters focus on in their final speech. I'll buy anything as long as it's well-explained and properly warranted and impacted and whatnot. You can expect good speaks from me if you do a good job of debating the framework. If you prefer the contention-level debate, that's cool too. Just make sure that you do a good job of weighing arguments for me. Also, when you extend arguments, make sure to reexplain the warrant and the impact when you do so. Blippy extensions and arguments are not your friends.

Definitional Debates: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Please try and avoid these at all costs.

Cross-ex: I pay attention to cross-examination pretty closely, but I won't take CX into account when making my decision unless you bring it up in your speech later.

Speed: I'm not the greatest at handling extremely high speaking speeds, to be completely honest. You can definitely talk quickly (I usually talked around 250-260 wpm in high school), but I probably won't be able to properly flow a full-on spread. I will yell "clear" if I think that you are either going too fast or are just unclear. Please slow down for taglines and author names at the very least. Also, please don't use speed to exclude your opponent from the round. If you do it, I'll nuke your speaks because the debate should be accessible to everyone who's involved in the round.

Kritiks: I'm more than willing to buy them, but please don't go overly fast if you're going to run one. I need to be able to actually understand the argument that you're making, and it can be kind of tough to do that if you're going extremely fast. I'm not really well-versed in K literature, so please do me a favor and slow down so that I can actually understand your argument. I won't vote for a K if I don't understand it.

DAs/CPs: I'll buy them as long as you explain them well.

Theory: I'll buy it as long as it's not frivolous theory. Only run it if there's an actual abuse that's occurring in the round. Make sure that you have voting issues when you run theory!

Speaker Points: I tend to be pretty generous with speaker points. My general range is anywhere from 25-30 speaker points. I tend to average between 28 and 29 speaker points. Generally, I calculate speaker points depending on how good of a speaker you were, how smart/clever you were in round, your use of CX, and your organization/use of voting issues in round.

Above all else, have fun! If you have other questions, ask me before the round!
