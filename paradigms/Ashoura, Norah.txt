  Do what you want.
Things to know:
a) Go at whatever speed you'd like. If you spread, as long as you're clear and slow it down for things like authors, tags, and any strategically placed nuance you plan to extend, you're golden. 
b) Don't run theory (outside framework justifications) unless there is abuse (if there is,run a proper shell with clear voters so I can drop that debater)
