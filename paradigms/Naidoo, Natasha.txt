  I'm a former policy debater currently in graduate school. In the past I was quite involved and coached for a while, but its been a few years and I've scaled back to occasional judging.

Generally speaking I'm tab, but I do have a slight bias towards T and K's, meaning that I do believe that T generally comes before the vast majority of framework arguments because it is the gateway into the round. And that I was a K debater and am very comfortable voting for K's so long as they have well articulated alternatives. That said, I am very open to all sorts of arguments, tag team, and speed (so long as its clear), and have judged everything from out rounds at bid tournaments, to local debate workshops. I prefer judging policy because I have the most experience in it, but I’ve also judged LD, Parli and all the IE’S. I'm happy to give you my ballot so long as the argument is well supported, (it can be crazy, but if you have cards, go for it!)
