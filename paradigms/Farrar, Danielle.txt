  I am primarily a philosophy and flow judge. I think speed is good as long as it is coherent and articulated. I will vote primarily on your value and value criterion clash and case structure. Off-time road maps are unacceptable. Drops of whole contentions are important, but drops of single facts or details are not as important. As for time, I will time the round, and it is okay for you to time yourselves as well. I have strong preference if you sit or stand to speak. Please stand to read your case and rebuttals.
