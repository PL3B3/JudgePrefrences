  I was a debater at Dexter High School in Michigan, and I'm now a freshman at Berkeley and a coach for Harker.

I'm open to any argument, and I don't have any preferences that can't be overwhelmed by good debating. However, I'm most familiar and comfortable with policy positions.
Although I'll vote for anything, I would prefer to see debates in which teams defend topical plans. Negatives should feel free to go go for kritik arguments, but I'd prefer that teams talk more about the plan/advantages than their feelings.
