Kim Lee
3rd year judge

Speed: If you speak quickly, you have to be clear. I prefer slower speakers, and cannot follow spreading.
Value/criterion: There should be some clear standard for me to judge the round off of. 
Use of evidence: Analysis is fine, but many arguments need empirical evidence.
Jargon: Should be kept to a minimum
Topicality: Only argue topicality if necessary
Counterplans: Fine
Critiques: Critiques are okay, but I would rather judge the substance of the contentions
Definition debate: Be practical and fair with definitions
Theory: In the case of severe 'abuse', it is understandable. Not otherwise. 

Do not be abusive or too abrasive within rounds, treat your opponent with professional courtesy.
