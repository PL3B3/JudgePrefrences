Coach at Hebron High School, Lewisville ISD.


Number of Years Judging: 12 years.

Here's my academic background. I have a BA in Political Science, another BA in English Lit (both from East Central U.), and a Masters in International Relations with a focus in Counter Terrorism from Norwich University. In CX this lends me toward the policymaker paradigm. However I am really cool with kritiks, I can deal with theory arguments, but things have to be really abusive for me to vote on something like Dispo bad. Bascially sell me on the argument. I am cool with speed, and if I can't hear or understand you, I will let you know in an obvious way. Basically I am good to go with many things. About the only thing I don't like to vote on is topicality. I am more into getting a policy comparison or kritikal (critical) alternative that I can use to vote on. I will vote for topicality if it is really abusive, but I will really resent it.

For LD debate, I am pretty cool with anything. I am used to the junk they run in CX, so the junk you cover in camps does not bother me. I am very well versed in philosophy, so run what you will. I will enjoy it.
