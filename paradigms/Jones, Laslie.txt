Experience- I have been involved with speech and debate since 2001. In high school I did policy debate for one year, and L/D for 2 years as well as extemp and congress. I competed for two years at the University of Alabama and have judged many high school tournaments for the past 5 years both local and national.

Philosophy - While I have policy debate experience, I prefer the more traditional style of L/D debate in terms of both speed and arguments. In the end, I will weigh what the debaters present to me in the round. I value the educational aspect of this activity and so I prefer to hear a discussion about the actual topic instead of a dialogue about the trivial.

If you have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
