Policy and LD:

I have returned to debate after some time away. Over the last couple of years, I have judged mostly public forum. We lived in Maine for nine years, so not a lot of debate. But, I have judged a smattering of policy and LD rounds over the last few years. Now that you are frightened, let me be specific.

Overall, I believe that rounds should be judged based upon the arguments presented.
• First, that means that clarity is paramount. Obviously, my pen time is slow. Roadmaps are good. Labeling, numbering, and differentiating arguments is necessary. Watch me. Listen. You will be able to tell if you are going too fast or are unclear. Some speed is ok, but clarity is best. I am a college professor of communication. I strongly believe that debaters should be able to communicate well.
• I prefer a policy debate to a theory debate. Theory is ok if it is explained and applicable. But, remember that I have not heard a lot of theory debates recently, so it is your responsibility to explain, apply, and weigh.
• Critical arguments are ok, if they are well explained and argued. Since I have not been judging a lot recently, I do not know much of the jargon or many of the assumption of the arguments. It is your responsibility to explain. Having said that, my area of research is feminist and critical. So, I have some background with these issues. Go down this path only if you will bear the responsibility to explain and weigh without a lot of theory/jargon.
• Framework arguments can be very useful if well explained and incorporated into your overall argument strategy.
• Last, and importantly, weigh your arguments. It is your job to put the round together for me. Tell a good story, which means incorporating the evidence and arguments into a narrative. And, weigh the issues. If you do not, at least one team will be unhappy with the results if I must intervene.

Finally, I believe that debate is about critical thinking and civic engagement. Better debaters are those who engage arguments, partners, opponents, and judges critically and civilly. Be polite, smart, and even aggressive, but don’t be impolite or a bully. I prefer not to see “tag team” cross x. Debaters should be able to ask questions, answer questions, and explain positions and evidence. And, have fun since debate should be fun.


Public Forum:

I have judged mostly public forum over the past couple of years. This year I am working primarily, although not exclusively, with the Blake Public Forum team. Basically, I believe that public forum should be an event that is adapted to and can be judged by any interested citizen. A couple of specific issues in terms of judging:

• The crux of public forum is good solid argumentation delivered well. Solid arguments are those that address the resolution, are well organized, are well reasoned, and supported with quality evidence that is explained.
• Good analytical arguments are useful but not sufficient. If you make an argument, you bear the responsibility of supporting, explaining, and weighing the argument.
• It is vital to weigh your arguments, which is best to begin before the final focus.

Certainly, since public forum is about the citizen judge, it is important to be smart, polite and even assertive. But, do not bully. And, enjoy the opportunity for engagement on important questions of the day.
