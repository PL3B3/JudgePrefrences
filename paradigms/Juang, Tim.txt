  I debated for Blake Debate in LD and Policy between 2008-2012 on the local and national circuit.

I'm open to any argument as long as it is well substantiated, clearly extended on the flow, and thoroughly analyzed/weighed in the rebuttals.Speed is fine.I default to rejecting the argument, not the debater.I will not vote on an argument I do not understand.Evidence quality matters.I'm relatively well-versed and receptive to critical argumentation.Speaker-point factors: Civility, humor, and having fun!
I try my best to not intervene.
