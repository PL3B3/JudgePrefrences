  I would not call myself the most progressive judge in the world. Theory is not up there on the list of things I like to see in rounds. I have a very high threshold for abuse so don't run theory unless you really think its warranted and give me a good justification if you do so. I'm more okay with speed, so long as you signpost well. I'll let you know if I can't understand. I like it when debaters make the round clear for me; give me a clear framework - V/VC or whatever you want to use to structure the debate but just link back to it.
