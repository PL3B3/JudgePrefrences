I judge primarily on the line by line. I'll use whatever paradigm you want but I'll default to a policymaker. 

Ks: I love Ks. I will listen to any argument as long as it's warranted and is clear.

T: I will default competing interps. You can win reasonability though. I have a hard time hearing T arguments a lot of the time. Go slower on the arguments to make sure I catch them. I have really bad hearing so I can't understand if you're going too fast.

Speed: You can go however fast you want make sure you're clear. I will yell CLEAR two times, after that I will stop flowing.

CPs: Must be textually competitive or have a solid net benefit. I don't like counterplans that are highly technical. I dont like multi-plank counterplans. You need a clear reason why the CP is better.

DAs: I'll vote on any DA make sure the link is clear and warranted.

Condo: There's no difference between one more or less condo advocacy than exists in the round. A ridicoulous amount of condo advocacies (like five) makes condo a voter, otherwise it would have to be dropped. 

Speaks: It's not just sounding good, it's making clear and warranted arguments. 27 is my lowest speaker point I'll give. I'll give the average speaker a 28. If you're just real bad (offensive and racist,) I'll give you like a 20 or something. Don't call "all muslims terrorists". 

Language Ks: there would have to be a warranted reason to why I should drop the team and not the argument. "You guys" is different then racial slurs however, it's subjective and I don't want to have to evaluate things like this. Just don't say offensive things. 

CX: Be aggressive and assertive, don't be a douche. There's a fine line. Being funny is good.
