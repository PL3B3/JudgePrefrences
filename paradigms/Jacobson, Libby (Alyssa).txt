  I currently attend and compete on the Model United Nations team for the University of Miami.
I debated for four years for MVLA. Three of these were in LD debate, while my last year was in Parli. 

Speed-Please use speed only if you really have that much to fit in. If you use speed and have three extra minutes then you didn't need it. Clarity is also key. I can flow quickly as long as you're speaking clearly.
Theory-I prefer theory run when there really is a violation. When answering a theory shell, please provide counter interpretations. 
Weighing-I prefer when my decision is clear because you have compared your arguments to your opponents. Weighing is always very helpful. Make sure your arguments are justified and explained thoroughly as I don't use blips to evaluate the round. 
Kritiks-I would really prefer if you didn't run them. Most end up being nonsensical. 
Speaks-I assign more based on strategy and quality of arguments. But, if I can't understand you or you are being severely rude then you will see this reflected. 

Please feel free to ask any further questions.
