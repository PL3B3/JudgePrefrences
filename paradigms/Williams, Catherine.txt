Went to Alpharetta High School
Policy Debate for four years 



T: Like it when there is impact work and analysis done, if not it is messy, I default to reasonability

CPs: Tend to lean neg on questions of CP competition , see below for theoy, i refuse to judge kick, needs a clear net benefit

Ks: I get most K lit besides high theory (strike me if you read high theory) I dabbed in identity ks in high school but by no means should I be your 1 in an identity debate. my favorite k debates are neolib, security, fem 

DA: DA outweighs and turns case analysis is extremely important and will be rewarded
Oceans update: the topic DAs can be contrived and silly - if a 2A spends 30 seconds and just makes analytics - do not assume that you should go for the DA, it probably means the DA was bad or doesnt apply or the aff solves the impact

PTX: I am from Alpharetta, I love the DA - but know which group your DA is in the context of (GOP, Tea Party, Middle Dems, Leftist Dems, etc.) 
update - I major in political science if the ptx scenario is contrived and illogical (as most are) don't waste your breath

FW: i come from a team that loves framework and I get it - but I ran a plantextless aff my senior year and now framework really feels like whining - at the end of the day it's about who creates a better educational space fairness should not be a word said by the neg

Theory: condo is good, any cp probably isnt abusive enough to reject the team, must have solvency advocate, I will not vote on ptx theory ever - except a well developed disad non intrinsic debate because the disad is not intrinsic at all, vague alts is probably just a reason to reject the alt

Speaker points: look to my coach Mr. Smiley - a 29.2 means that I expect this to be the best speech at the tournament, a 30 means you should win top speaker at the TOC

If I think you are stealing prep, I will start my timer without telling you

Prep stops when the email is sent or the flash drive leaves the computer

Bonus:
Don't be rude - I don't tolerate speaking over partners

china topic - I am not too involved in the lit base - but t-qpq was an arg read when I debated in high school it absolutely should be in the 1NC and I'm very bias towards it
