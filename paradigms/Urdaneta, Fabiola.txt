I don’t debate anymore, though I do judge every so often. To be honest, I don’t have enough experience
in judging to tell you specific ways in which I judge a debate. Yet, I will say some general things that you
probably already know:
1) Please be as clear as possible – I mean this more with reference to your arguments than your
speaking. I understand that debate is a game and speaking fast is a tactic, I have no problem
with that. But amidst reading cards and blocks, you do have to make a contextualized argument
with a claim and clear impacts. Preferably, this includes qualified evidence that you explain and
compare to your opponent’s evidence. So, you can argue whatever you want, just please make
sure you explain why you think that’s important.
2) Have fun and be nice – it’s an inherently stressful and tense activity, I understand. But, relax
and try to enjoy it. It helps your credibility to not be so stressed out and it makes it a better
experience for the rest of us in the room.
One last thing--don’t be concerned about reading something I will or will not like, just do what you feel
comfortable with. I do come from a very research intensive debate background though, so if you’d like
me to value certain things over argument and evidence just let me know.
Good luck!
