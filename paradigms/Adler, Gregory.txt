  I have one cave eat--

If you read evidence (cards) so fast that I can not understand its content, I will not evaluate that evidence. I'll rephrase that--- I need to understand your evidence when you read it or else in my mind you have not made the arguments or points from that evidence and therefore it would be unfair to pretend as if you had or to read through the evidence to create these arguments for you. I need arguments to be communicated to me in round. 

Other than that I am open to both policy and critical arguments--- I have debated both.
