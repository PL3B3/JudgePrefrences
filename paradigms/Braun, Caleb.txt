  I debated for 4 years at Joshua High School. I'm okay with speed just make sure you're clear. Also, if you expect me to get every single theory or topicality argument, you should probably slow down and make it clear when you're moving between arguments. Kritiks are fine, although I will say that I probably am not well versed in the literature and it's fairly annoying when teams answer questions about their K incorrectly. Defend your alt well and you should be in good shape. Alternatively, if you are aff you should probably attack the alternative because most alts don't actually solve the criticism. I will evaluate topicality debates and framework debates however the more persuasive team tells me I should. That being said i'll generally default to competing interpretations and policy making respectively. Essentially I'm cool with anything, (although I haven't seen too many high school teams that can argue extremely abstract positions very well, so i'd prefer that you at least defend the resolution and such) but if you can defend your position well, go for it. Being funny is always a plus, but don't be a jerk. Otherwise have fun and feel free to ask more questions.
