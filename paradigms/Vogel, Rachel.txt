  I debated for Lamar High School from '05-'06, and Carnegie Vanguard from '06-'09.
I enjoy critical debate but I have a low threshold for arguments that preclude a lot of opponent's offense, so if that is your strategy make sure it is well developed and clearly extended. I vote based on what you tell me to vote on, so make the reasons to affirm/negate clear in your last speech. Good weighing and interesting arguments will get you higher speaks.
