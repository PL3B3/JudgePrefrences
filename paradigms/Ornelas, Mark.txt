Given the recent political climate for judging in college I have drastically revised my philosophy.

First, I debated at Damien & debate at Gonzaga; both are very much flex teams and have a ran a large variety of arguments. I will vote on things that are communicated to me as something I should vote on. I will evaluate all forms of debate, and will evaluate them as the debaters tell me to in the round. You should be able to read my facial expressions to know if I am buying your arguments. Have fun and good luck.

Now speaker points: I will evaluate them in the context of the Ross Smith video (http://vimeo.com/5414305). My general range is 26-30.

Ethics: Clipping, Fabrication of Evidence, Seriously Mis-citing of evidence, False Disclosure and Stealing Prep will get me to drop you almost immediately if I deem that you did any of the above. Your speaker points will go as low as the tournament will allow me to give them. Any other punishment that the tournament imposes is up to them. I also reserve the right to stop the round due to any overly offensive ad hominem against the other team if it makes me uncomfortable in the round. If there are extensive rude remarks, I will not drop you unless it is egregious, but I will your speaker points will be extremely low, and I will speak to your coach. I will almost never do this, but I have know certain circumstance on which I have heard of rounds where this was appropriate (for the former, and I have done the latter).

Prep: If you don't need to use all of your prep, don't. I like to get our early as do most other judges. Most tournaments run late, so I'm sure the tab room will appreciate a if we finish a few minutes early. Also a way to get some extra points from me.
