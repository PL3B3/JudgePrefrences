Position: Math Teacher, Capital City PCSYears coaching/judging: 10

Overview: I debated at Stuyvesant High School for 4 years (as well as coached and judged), and then sort-of at Cornell. I attended debate camp at UTNIF and Northwestern. I currently teach at Capital City PCS. I appreciate when debaters know what they're arguing, rather than relying on running arguments solely because you know that other teams don't understand the argument.

Comments on specific argument types:-Kritiks: If you run a kritik, you must explain the alternative. Not explaining the alternative means I weigh it less. Framework is good, but please clash and explain terminal impacts. -Topicality: I default to evaluating competing interpretations. But T really should come down to evaluating impacts and if you explain the internal links, I am more likely to vote for you.-Disads: Impact Calculus: please compare impacts!!! Explain the internal link story. -Theory: I've debated the spectrum and found points to appreciate on all sides. Well constructed, well formed, and well-extended arguments are a compelling reason for me to vote for you. But don't run some 3 second argument and expect I'm going to vote for you on that. Your cards are a tool for you to explain your arguments, not a blurb you read to cover your bases.-Counterplans: A counterplan that the other side proves to be theoretically abusive is illegitimate, and I will not vote for it.
Pet peeves: 
Don't be a jerk.If you slur while spreading, I prefer you just speak slower.Please give a roadmap before you start your speech. Please tell me to switch flows.Open c-x is fine but don't dominate your partner's open c-x.Don't steal prep time. I take prep time super seriously. When the timer is done, your hands need to be off the computer and you need to start giving a roadmap.
