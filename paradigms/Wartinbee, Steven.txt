  I debated 4 years LD for Loyola in LA, qualifying to the TOC my senior year. I'm fine with speed, theory (RVIs), K's, whatever you want to run as long as you explain it clearly, and how it should determine my decision. Ask me before round if you want to know specific preferences about types of arguments/styles of debate, because while I'll try to be as objective as possible I'm not going to pretend that certain things don't tend to IRK me.
