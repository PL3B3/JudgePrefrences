  I've been in the debate field for 4 years. I was at Esperanza High School during those years. I did Congress, Parli, Pofo, and Extemp while in High School. I have yet to judge on the topic being offered at VBT.

Spreading is a minor issue with me as it is most people not constantly exposed to it. I won't vote down due to spreading but I will vote down due to poor spreading. If you are not coherent enough to be understood, perhaps write a more concise case that doesn't require you to spread so fast.

Other than that, I will accept any argument as long as you can persuade me to do so. Theory, topicality, any off-case arguments: I will accept them all if you can offer good reason.
