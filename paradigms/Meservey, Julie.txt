  Hello and good luck. I am the wife of a debate coach. So debate has been around me for awhile but I have no formal training and have only judged one other tournament. I am looking for good communcation skills, strong support, clarity, and good clash. I will attempt to flow or at least try to take notes. I have learned about LD debate and look for the value criterion debate. I do not like speed and am excited to learn more about the topic.
