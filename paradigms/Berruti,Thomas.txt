  I debated on the circuit for 4 years for Bronx Science. This is my second year being a judge. Some things to keep in mind:

- I think K debates can be really interesting. Just make sure you clearly explain the argument. I’ll get really annoyed if you read a K and you clearly have no idea what it says.

- Theory is fine as long as it’s not overly obnoxious ie “Aff can’t have multiple standard justifications”. Even if it is really obnoxious, I’ll still vote on it, I’ll just lower your speaks. I default competing interps but reasonability good arguments are fine.

- Don’t be dumb. Being dumb is bad.

- I personally think offensive counter interps are offense. However, I’ll be receptive to arguments that say that they’re not.

- I’ll vote on narratives but I think a lot of these positions have really shitty ROTB arguments. If you think you can make a good ROTB argument for your narrative, go for it.

- I’m fine with larping.

- Regarding tricks, I’m fine with them as long as they’re not obnoxious. For example, I’m fine with you having one contingent standard. However, if your 1AR A-strat is to extend a bunch of theory blips out of the AC, I won’t immediately drop you, but don’t expect a 30.

- I’m fine with more critical frameworks. However, don’t run them for the sake of running them and make sure you explain them.

- I really don’t like people “triggering” presumption. I’ll vote on it, but you’ll receive lower speaks. If your strategy is to fuck up the round so much that I have to presume, you suck. Though extending presumption as a way to evaluate a difficult round is fine.


If you have any questions, feel free to talk to me before the round.
