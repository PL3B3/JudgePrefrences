  I was trained in LD debate when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Ben Franklin and I broke at Emory. That means that I was trained in Kantian theory (mostly the Categorical Imperative and Rawls' update of it with the veil of ignorance) social contract theory, and utilitarianism, mostly Mills. In addition, I was a debater at a Catholic high school, which means that Augustine is real for me. Since that time, I went on to earn a Ph.D. in English. I've read a lot of postmodern and Marxist theory, which means I'm at least aware of people like Butler (whose Gender Trouble I read a long time ago). While I'm not an anti-foundationalist, I'm familiar with the works of those who are, such as Foucault, whose Discipline and Punish I've written about in scholarship and the Chronicle of Higher Education. I'm probably most familiar with the work of the Frankfurt School thinkers, such as Marcuse and Adorno.

In terms of what I'm looking for, I want arguments pulled through (I won't do the work for you and finish your thought). I want clarity and signposting, and I value most what I went into debate for: clash.

I understand theory under reasonability, and I think of theory as check on abuse. I'm familiar with policy arguments, but you have to tell me how they function in a round.
