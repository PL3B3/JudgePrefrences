Number of Rounds Judged on this year's topic: 5
Number of Years Judging: 1

On a scale of 1 to 7
Topicality: 7 (Stick to the resolution; it's there for a reason.)
Evidence:6 (Warrant what you say; use authorities, I will also accept your own analysis.)
Performance: 6 (Persuade me that you are correct, though I look primarily to your warrants.)
Standards: 6 (Preferred, but not necessary so long as you're clear about where you're going.)
Speed Reading: 2 (I can understand you, but I don't enjoy listening to it.)
Counterplan: 4 (General refutation is adequate; I don't need a counterplan but I do need to see why your side is preferable or why your opponent presents a less desirable world.)

I enjoy philosophical debate, as well as sociological and economic analysis. The more original the ideas the better, though I won't vote on that. While I appreciate hypotheticals I consider myself a realist, so solvency is important in argumentation. Quality is more important than the quantity of arguments; one well made argument is superior to a large number of underdeveloped ideas.

If you have questions about anything I haven't covered in my paradigm, feel free to ask before the round begins.
