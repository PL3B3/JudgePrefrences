I am a traditional, lay judge. 

I look for a well established value premise and an appropriate set of criteria to evaluate.

I must see a structure and logical progression of your argument with specific supporting evidence. 

I like you guide me with well placed “sign posts” and key words. 

I look for crystal clear concepts and razor sharp vocabulary. 

I do like clash and look for a listening ear followed by thoughtful responses. I want to see the wheels turning and your ability to think on your feet in defense of your case. 

I do not favor speed talking. I will attempt to flow your arguments but will cease if the path of your presentation is unclear.

I will judge the round based on overall presentation by both debaters. Insignificant dropped arguments are not enough to give a loss. An argument’s weight, impact, and well reasoned linkage to the resolution’s value context will have a superior influence on my vote.

I like eye contact and relish passionate, persuasive delivery. 

Of course, good manners, courtesy, and respect for your fellow debaters is essential.
