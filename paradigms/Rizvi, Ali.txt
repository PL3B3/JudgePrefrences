Currently debating for UTD

TLDR: just ask tbh

T and FW: If the Aff explains why their counter-interpretation is better, then they are T. If the Neg wins their interpretation, they win. And yes, reasonability is a thing. When it goes to FW, impact it out. Will I evaluate K’s of T? Yeah.


CP/DA/Case: Yes, please. These are really good strategies. You would be surprised.

K: There is a difference between buzzwords and explaining arguments. If you can’t tell the difference between that, you probably shouldn’t run them. If you say the alt is "buzzword buzzword noun buzzword adjective buzzword" and the aff says that is not even a sentence, that will probably be the rfd.


Other stuff: Tech over Truth - if they had a really bad argument and they just beat you on it, then yeah you deserved the L. I am pretty fast, as long as you are clear. Clarity over Speed always. The last two rebuttals should tell me why I am voting for you. If you sit down after the 2nr and realize there was minimal DA ow Case argumentation, you should not be surprised how the debate will turn out to be. Have interps when you read theory please. I don’t understand teams who don’t. Also, if they just drop t - you can make life very easy for all of us by just extending t doing the bare bones, I will sign the ballot. 

Speaker Points: The more you make me laugh the higher speaks you get. Also, good arguments and strategy = higher points.
