Preferences:

1) Speed - I prefer faster rather than slower, but do not sacrifice clarity for speed. If I can't understand you, it's not going to help you win the debate.

2) Value / VC Clash - Value clash is a must. I will weigh the round heavily on who wins the V/VC clash, so please make this one of your voters.

3) Evidence - I want to see analytical, empirical, and/or philosophical evidence. Your arguments mean a lot more to me if they are well-supported rather than your own assertions.

4) Last rebuttals - I prefer the NEG to cover the flow and then present voting issues. If you prefer, give me voting issues as you go down the flow. I prefer AFF to spend all 3 minutes on clear, solid crystallization and voting issues. I think line-by-line as this point is ineffective.

Be polite, professional, and have fun! Looking forward to judging.
