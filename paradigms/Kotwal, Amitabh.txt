  I am a traditional judge. I do not like speed, and if you aren't articulate I will lower speaks.
 
On framework, make sure to provide comparisons and reasons to prefer overall. I would like to see clash, but if there isn't 'EXPLAIN' why.
 
On contention level, don't forget to weigh. I will take weighing into consideration more than random extensions.
 
If I don't hear something in the first speeches, extending it in the last speeches won't matter. So be comprehensive and understandable.
 
Speaking points will be based on articulation and style. Make me laugh, and I might give a little more points ðŸ˜Š.
