  CX- please establish a framework for me to evaluate the round and a reason for me to vote for you inside that framework.


LD- i believe debate provides a space to learn argumentation and critical thinking skills. during the round, regardless if you have a value, criterion, counter plan, disadvantage, kritik, or theory argument, provide reasons why that means you should win the round. 

there is no such thing as a 'reverse voting issue', only voting issues. if you think you ought win the round because your opponent ran an argument, you will have to be very convincing.
