  Hi I'm a parent judge judging for Shrewsbury High School

I am a novice judge and have judged a few time before. I don't like sped and I cannot flow the spread. I will say clear to slow you down. I would like a debate about the resolution. I cannot evaluate theory arguments nor can I evaluate kritikal position. Stick to stock substantive arguments and cases with clear reasons to vote for you. I will vote for the debater who persuaded me to vote for their position. I am still conscious of dropped arguments however and will take that into consideration. 

In short, 
no theoryno kritikal positionsno spreading
Please do the following
clearly explain what's important in the roundclearly extend your arguments fullyclearly tell me how your responses take out the argument
Have a good debate and have fun
