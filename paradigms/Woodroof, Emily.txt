  LD Judging Paradigm
Emily Woodroof

Background
I was an LD debater in high school, and I now teach debate (as well as logic, rhetoric, and philosophy) at The Oaks.

Paradigm
I evaluate the arguments left standing on the flow according to the best-defended framework to determine who made the better case for or against the resolution. Drops are only important to me if the debater clearly impacts the significance of the drop for the overall strength of their opponentâ€™s argument. In my decision, I will prioritize arguments mentioned in voting issues, but will also do my own flow analysis. I will not vote on factual, logical, or philosophical inconsistencies not mentioned by the debaters. Finally, I prefer traditional LD, but will not categorically vote against a progressive debater.
