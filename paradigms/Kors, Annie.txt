  I am a Junior US History major at Yale. I debated LD for four years at Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles. I qualified to the TOC for three years, and broke my senior year. This means I'm familiar with / comfortable with the tech and flow aspects of circuit LD, and all that fun stuff. I don't have a lot of strong preferences so I'm going to keep this nice and short.

- DON'T be mean and DO be clear.
- I default to evaluating based on a comparative worlds paradigm but am more than willing to listen to arguments against that and will evaluate the round how I am told by the debaters.
- I have a high threshold for skep/ridiculous theory/general sketchiness/blippiness - all that this means is that I will have a higher standard for warrants for arguments than perhaps people who run those things regularly might prefer, and I will be receptive to substantive responses to them. I will vote on those things, but you will fare better running them in front of me if they have solid warrants.
- I really like substantive debate, so if you wanted to have a good substantive debate that would make me very happy.
- I ran/debated critical stuff a lot in high school and like it when it's done well, but that does NOT mean that I 1) necessarily understand the dense critical literature that you're referencing 2) will impose my understanding if you haven't made it clear in round OR 3) will automatically love the fact that you've introduced a pre-fiat level
- K debaters: you will be better off in front of me if you have a concrete alt
- I like debate, so have fun and be smart and do your best and everything will be good :)

Final Note: If you say something blatantly offensive, or that I think would/could make the debate round an unsafe or incredibly uncomfortable space, I will have no qualms about dropping you (not just your speaks) on that basis alone. I sincerely doubt that this will ever be a problem, but I want to give fair warning. If you think this will apply to you, just strike me, please. I'm happy to discuss before round if you have questions about how this applies to arguments, but the point is that it really shouldn't.
