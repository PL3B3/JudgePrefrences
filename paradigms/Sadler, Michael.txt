I do not debate for Weber State University but I did do policy debate at Davis High School for 4 years. This is my first year Judging, so I haven’t fully developed my philosophies. What I do think has developed through my debate experience.I’ll really vote on anything if you explain and contextualize it well enough. (if they concede and you didn’t do enough work to justify the vote, I’m a little hesitant)I’ll vote on T if the 2NR is winning the T debate at each level. They really need to be non topical or at least shady in their topicality if your going to go for it in the 2NR (duh)I'm okay with theory, but be winning it at each level, to do that there kind of needs to be real abuse or a real violation. I’m hesitant to vote on a process CP. But am more willing to accept the negative’s conditional advocacy as long as there are not to many of them.I don’t have experience with performance but give me a reason to vote and I will.I like a good K but that doesn't mean I won’t vote on a CP/DA. If you do run a K, explain it well enough to justify the vote.
I make the majority of my decision out of the 2NR/2AR. The more clear the reason to vote for you the more likely I am to vote in that direction. This makes clarity, structure, and contextualization to the round important. A good line by line makes it easy for me to keep a clean flow as well as a clean vote. In final, I will be very disappointed if I have to make links myself and fill in your blanks. If I had to do this, I probably wouldn’t, and you probably would get voted down.
