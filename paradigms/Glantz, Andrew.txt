  I'm a senior Lincoln-Douglas debater at Brentwood School in Los Angeles, CA. I've debated for four years and have qualified to TOC my junior and senior years with 3 and 5 bids respectively.

I'm ok with most things and will vote off the flow.

Speed: I'm ok with speed as long as it's clear. If you are doing something not stock then go slower. Go slower on framework- I will have a higher threshold as a judge for understanding arguments the first time they are made.

Theory: I'm good with theory but won't like a bad theory debate. If you're going to run it then do it well. I'm open to anything but I guess I default to competing interpretations, theory is not a RVI, fairness and education are voters. But not really- give me some argument for anything and I'll lean that way.

Kritiks: I don't like K's- if you run them in front of me, note that I think they're stupid and unless you run it really well and explain it in a coherent manner I'll probably not vote for you.

I like clash- do it and you'll also get good speaks. Be responsive and don't be repetitive. Read my facial expressions and see if I'm flowing to see if you should keep explaining the argument or if I got it.

Feel free to ask me any specific questions before the round. I'm open to anything except openly offensive arguments. Have fun.
