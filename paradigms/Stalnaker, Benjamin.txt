I debated almost exclusively on the local circuit in southwestern PA for 4 years, qualifying to Nationals three times, CFL's twice, finished as the second best LDer in the state.

That being said, I'm open to anything! I am a philosophy major, and I am familiar with a lot of critical literature. However, I expect you to speak at a speed that a normal human could understand, and I prefer some sort of value/criterion structure. If you want to try policy args, or crazy kritikal args, or theory you can go for it. All I ask is that you explain clearly and use these sorts of arguments to have a round, not to avoid one (meaning you don't make arguments inaccessible to your opponent or advance arguments unrelated or tangential to the resolution). I vote off of the flow, but I will only flow what I can understand.

Speaks-- 0-25 I don't expect to give out these scores, please don't make me. 
25-26 you still need some serious work
26-27 I do not think you were that good
27-28 could break. i'm not a gambling man, so I wouldn't bet on it
28-29 solid performance. i was not upset
29-29.9 you are very good. continue in this activity.
30 i would like to take you out to coffee and pick your brain.
