  Experience: Did PF @ Westwood High School for 4 years.

PF Paradigm: 
-I’ll listen to any argument you make as long as it is warranted. 
-Make sure you do impact calc and analysis because I don’t want to do any work for you. By the end of the round, it should be clear who is winning the round. If it’s not, I’m gonna do my own work and the round is out of your hands. 
-Read credible evidence. 
-I’ll vote you down if you try to do anything sketchy

Speed: Moderate speed is okay as long as you enunciate.

Speaks: Be clear. Be polite. Funny = better speaks. GoT references = better speaks. 

Other: For extensions, you have to extend more than just the tagline.

I am best friends with Keaton McDonald.
