  I am a parent judge and have judged LD for the past three and a half years. I also judged policy at NFL Nationals in 2013, so I have some experience with spreading and circuit debate. However, you can talk fast but do NOT spread. It will take me more effort to understand you and I may not grasp everything you have said. Also, do not just read evidence—make sure to spend time analyzing whatever evidence you think is key. Make voting issues clear and have developed link stories, not just big impacts.

Do not run K’s or theory, please.
Make sure to be polite and have fun debating!
