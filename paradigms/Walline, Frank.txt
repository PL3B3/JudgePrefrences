  I did C-X for four years in high school and was pretty successful, just keep in mind that I debated in Idaho and I'm not completely accustomed to judging on the national circuit. 

I don't care what you read, just tell me why it's important and I'll vote on it. I like good impact calculus and I love hearing a kritik if both you and your partner know what you're talking about. I tend to vote for the team with the best strategy, but I'm open to any framework you may wanna read. Topicality is cool if you can prove an abuse scenario, otherwise i really have no reason to care if the aff is untopical. This is your round, do what you want with it. Just don't be mean, especially to your partner. If you have any other questions, just ask me before round I'd be happy to clarify.
