Rounds judged on this topic: 0; I don’t have a lot of familiarity with oceans stuff, so try to avoid topic-specific acronyms and realize I don’t know what the community has decided is T vs not, etc.
 
Brief history
Debated as a 1N/2A at most of the major national tournaments while in high school reading heg affs and extending things like the politics disad all four years. Very limited exposure to critical literature, but I’m not necessarily opposed to those debates – just explain things instead of banking on me having a lot of background knowledge on your author of choice.
 
Guidelines I’ll follow regardless of the content of the debate
--no prep for flashing
--speech times are non-negotiable and I’ll only vote for one team at the end of the round
--if I catch you clipping, the debate will continue but I’ll drop you and give you crap for speaks. If the other team catches you and forwards an ethics challenge the debate stops and becomes about whether they can prove it or not.
 
Argument stuff
--Besides having a serious soft spot for specific case debates (a 2N that knows the other team’s aff really well and deploys a neg strategically because of it is super impressive and will be rewarded with good speaks) I don’t have a lot of strong preferences I’m aware of.
--I’m generally more familiar with a debate about the consequences of the enactment of a topical plan, but I’ll listen to other things (I’m willing to vote for framework but certainly don’t default to that). Just be forewarned that no matter how well YOU think you debated it, if I don’t understand your argument at the end of the round I’m not going to vote for you.
--I don’t feel strongly on theory other than SLOW DOWN on it. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not a perfect flow and people tend to buzz through theory blocks like their judge is a machine. I need to be able to draw a line on my flow through the debate from speeches like 1AR to 2AR, etc. to actually put weight in your arguments.
