  I love to see a good Value/Criterion debate! Impact your arguments back the the V/C. Also, please give clear voting issues and weigh them in the context of V/C as well. I'm fine with speed, though I prefer moderate speed to an extremely fast one. I'm not a huge fan of Critiques. Besides that I'm pretty chill. Just be polite, have fun, and make good arguments :). My debate experience is in Varsity LD and Oratory for 3 yrs in high school.
