  Preface: The items documented below are my personal thoughts, feelings and ethics as I was taught competitive debate. There are those who may disagree with some items, that is their right. However, show respect by communicating directly to me about those items in a professional and educational manner. I am open to an open dialogue and am willing to adjust any item as long as it is support with facts and not personal opinion.

Paradigm overview: I am a “traditional / conservative” stock issue / policy style debate judge believing there are rules, duties, and obligations of each speaker in the round. I tend to reward those debaters that follow the traditional speaker duties that are outlined in every basic HIGH SCHOOL debate manual. I am a firm believer in direct clash / refutation. Debate rounds need to be based on the resolution and not entirely on the educational value (fairness) of the opponent (see Political Disadvantage below). I want to see a round that documents status quo harms, what the affirmative is going to do to solve those harms and the negative defending the status quo or presenting a non-topical counterplan. With that mentioned, ultimately, my decisions are based on what is presented in the round which is fair to both side. If the negative wins one stock issue, they win round due to the affirmative's failure to satisfy its burden of proof. Additionally, I am a firm believer that the judge is NOT the third team/competitor in the round. Avoid using phrases like, "If you don't buy this....than consider this...." type of statements. This only inserts the judge into the round and allows them to input their thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, etc. into the round and vote accordingly. Finally, I am becoming more concerned with I see debaters attempt "tricks" they have learned from senior team mates and college workshops when they have not learned practical debate theory, rules, ethics, and practices. This is an educational experience that has unlimited advantages but the debater must first understand why we do what we do and how to do them properly before they attempt the tricks. Winning a round or tournament, is great but it's not everything. You must first learn to ride a tricycle before you move to a Harley.

Judging Paradigm:
Speed: I am fine with rapid fire as long as the speaker is understandable with sufficient sign-posting. Basic rule is I must be able to flow the speech. I will not prompt the speaker. Basic communication rules of style / delivery is also applicable in debate. Speaker points will be reduced.Arguments: I prefer direct clash in a round in contrast to having an affirmative case and a negative case that is not linked to the affirmative case. As a judge, it is not my responsibility to apply the negative case to the affirmative case outline. Negative teams tend to run briefs on an affirmative case with no direct clash with the expectation that I will apply the argument. Briefs are a good tool but do not take the place of direct refutation.Counterplans: First must follow the principle of not being topical. Otherwise, I am judging two topical affirmative cases in the round. The counterplan is an automatic admission to a harm existing in the status quo. The difference, the negative team can solve the harm in another and better way than what the affirmative team is presenting. For example, if the resolution states that the federal government should do something but the same outcome can be done by allowing states to do it. Counterplans are one of the most difficult and mis-understood items in competitive debate.Disadvantages: A disadvantage must be linked to the affirmative case, show significant harm and have a significant impact. I have noticed that once a negative team hears what the topic of the affirmative case, the negative team stops flowing to open files, etc. and pull their negative briefs they have regarding that topic. They then read the entire brief but offer no direct clash or link to the affirmative case.Cross-Examination: I am not a fan of open cross-examination. Only the two speakers that are scheduled to participate should participate. Partners should remain silent and not interject themselves in the cross examination they are not scheduled to participate. I am also not a fan of utilizing prep time for additional cross examination. Contestants must follow the rules of the event and how cross examination is scheduled for that particular event (LD, PF or CX). Do not accept FLEX CROSS-EXAMINATION. Reasoning: There is specific time allocated for CX, additional questions outside of that time interferes with opponent and their prepping.Political Disadvantages (aka – unfair to negative team): Unless the negative team can show how an affirmative case that satisfies its burden is unfair to them specifically, I typically will not accept this argument. The disadvantage must be specifically applied to the round and not be a generic disadvantage that can be applied to every affirmative case the negative team hits. If the affirmative team satisfies their burden of proof, then the negative team must be prepared to defend the status quo, this is not an unfair burden, it is their responsibility. This is the foundation of competitive debate. All debaters must be prepared for anything at any time.Kritic: As a judge, I evaluate all arguments placed into the round and vote accordingly. Like any argument, a kritic must be applicable, unique and have a significant value in the round. Being an existential indictment of the opponents position, it needs to satisfy the same requirements for me to vote on it. The burden is on the debater, not the judge, to decide upon its appropriateness. The debater must defend the indictment as well as the overall impact of the kritic.Laptops: Over the past few years I am becoming less of a fan of laptops in a round but there is basically nothing that I can do about it except to say, if laptops are being used they need to be fully charged prior to the round, should be an extension of the debater and not become a liability and on the correct screen(s). I would also recommend that the 1AC be printed for presentation to the negative team / judge upon request instead of giving them the laptop.Flashing Time - Unless there is an excessive amount of time used, I will not count flashing during a team's prep time. However, I reserve the right to ask a team to begin prep time if there is an issue, problem, devise malfunction, etc. of the flashing process. This will be a judgment call on my part to maintain the flow of the round as well as fairness to the opponent.Pet Peeves: (1) If a debater asks me how I feel about something, I tell them and they then proceed to do the exact opposite (i.e., rapid fire is okay if I can understand and flow it but the debater speaks so fast that the only thing I can understand are the five breaths they take in a constructive speech. (2) Rudeness (i.e., people up and moving around while a speaker is speaking, laptops being shuffled from team to team during a speech. (3) Opposing team loudly talking to one another while a speaker is speaking. (4) Prompting - once a speaker is on the floor, they are then on their own. Team mates should not prompt or pass notes during the speech. (5) Time-keeping needs to be done by one team mate at a time. I have been in rounds where all four debaters are using four different devices and it sounds like a holiday on Time Square when the all four signal that time has expired at four different times. (6) It is the responsibility of all debaters to be aware of and update their cases according to what is going on in the status quo.Voting Issues / Reason for Decision philosophy: I typically base my reason for decisions on a stock issue analysis. My rationale is based on the theory that the affirmative team must maintain its burden of proof responsibility. If the negative team wins one stock issue, they win the round. The stock issue analysis is based upon: Significance (quantitative and qualitative), Harms, Inherency (structural, attitudinal, etc.), Topicality and Solvency.Ballot Disclosure / Oral's - I very rarely disclose my ballot in a preliminary round. I found I usually end up in a debate with the loosing team and having to defend my position on every argument they ran in the round. If time and tournament rules allow, I will give an oral critique but typically will generalize on technique and style. If there are key issues that need to be discussed, I will review them in a "generalized" manner without disclosure. I am always available for questions after the ballot is tuned in and schedule permits."Executive Fiat" - There is no such item in competitive debate. Some teams have defined an Executive Order, issued by the President, as "Executive Fiat". There is a fallacy in this practice. Fiat, as defined by all debate rhetorical education documents, states that the affirmative plan will be passed by Congress (legislative branch). Competitive debate is policy" driven thus falling under the jurisdiction of the legislative branch of government. "Executive Fiat" falls under the executive branch of government, thus outside the scope of policy debate."Puns" - Can be cute and funny but for only 30 seconds or so. They must have a link and impact to the round. Once they take over and control the round, they no longer are cute and have lost their effectiveness.
Debate has been one of the most beneficial activities that I ever participated. It allowed me to develop my speaking, organizational and research skills that are still used today in my professional life. It is an educational tool that will open many doors that are not available to others. It is an educational tool that assists the participant in all educational endeavors. It is a source of self, family and school pride. The rewards of debate are as wide and open depending upon how much the debater commits to it.
