  I will vote on theory, framework, representations, epistemology, ontological violence, methodologies, realism, consequentialism, nuclear war, or ecological catastrophe. Either way I expect warrants to be extended properly and impact analysis to be stressed. If you want me to vote on a specific issue, put the analysis on the flow. Shadow extensions in the 2NR and 2AR are not going to cut it. Debate is a game of warrant comparison and impact analysis. Debaters tend to be unclear on the theory debate;thats not cool. Cross x is about making arguments.
