  Overview: I am a history teacher first and a Speech and Debate coach second. I am interested in seeing a good debate. A good debate is when each team has a clear roadmap and follows it. The teams also are focused on creating clear and concise contentions and not overusing jargon that only applies to their specific event and nothing else. Good, clear clash with a good weighing analysis and a decision criterion to evaluate the arguments is essential. Presentation skills are essential. These are "life skills": clarity, simplicity and power of persuasion.
Speed: Definitely not preferred.
Miscellaneous: Please time yourselves and do so cooperatively. Be well-dressed and professional at all times. Assertiveness is great--but rudeness is very bad. It's a thin line, but one that you must learn as a "life skill."
Speaker Points: 30s will be extremely rare and so will anything less than 26.

30- Well done, you're definitely one of my favorites
29- Great presentation, good arguments, I enjoyed the debate
28- You are doing a solid job but could improve
27- You have not reached your potential or are being somewhat rude
26- Entering the "you're unprofessional" zone
25 and below- This should not happen
