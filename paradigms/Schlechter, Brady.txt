  Debate experience/background: I did four years of policy debate for Huron in high school. I stuck to the local South Dakota circuit. Currently I am the head debate coach at Vermillion High School.

General paradigm/philosophy: I consider myself to be a stock issues judge, but if you can give me a legitimate reason to vote another way, I'll consider it.

Speed: I am not a huge fan of speed, though I understand it's a part of the activity. On a scale of 1-10 I consider myself about a 6. You need to be clear, and take the time to persuade.

Topicality: Generally, I have a huge aff bias on T. As long as case is reasonably foreseeable, I tend to vote Aff. Please make the use of this argument strategic and not just a useless time-suck that does nothing for you in the round.

DAs: I can enjoy unique, interesting, and well-researched scenarios. I'm generally skeptical of links so you'll need to do a lot of work there. If you are going for this, impact calc is a must. Additionally, I really don't like to see generics, they generally don't lend themselves to good debate.

CPs: Counterplans can make for interesting debates, but I won't even listen to a topical counterplan, so don't bother. Otherwise, give me a good CP and a reason to prefer it over the Aff, and I'll be happy to listen.

Kritiks: I feel that the confines of a debate round usually are not conducive to a thorough exploration of K arguments. Still, if you do it well, I'll listen. If you do not understand the literature behind the K you are running, then don't run it in front of me. I may not know or understand the specific author or the philosophy very well, but it is really easy to tell if you don't either.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
