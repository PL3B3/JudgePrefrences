  What’s my background?



I’ve debated for fouryears at the University of West Georgia. I’ve researched and debated a wide variety of arguments, from politics to race-based criticisms. I have qualified to the NDT multiple times, and won several national college tournaments. So, you can be assured that I possess rudimentary mental faculties. Breathe easy.

What do I think about arguments?

Meta is vital – The last two rebuttals need to impact arguments, perform evidence comparison, and write my ballot.

Topicality – I can be easily convinced that topicality is an a priori voting issue, but need debaters to warrant their claims and provide impacts to abstract concepts like fairness and limits. I am open to criticisms of topicality, but they also need be impacted before they become relevant.

Disadvantages/CPs – I have a love for a well DA/CP or DA/Case strategy. I am familiar with most disadvantage and counterplan genres. Please explain and contextualize your impact.

Kritiks – Don’t be shallow! Explain the criticisms, make specific link and impact extrapolations, and if you have an alternative, please explain it.

K affs – You don’t have to read a plan, but you should be more than prepared to defend that choice.

Theory – Theoretical arguments should not be blippy, because if I can’t hear it, I can’t flow it. Secondarily, theory arguments should be impacted clearly and explicitly.
