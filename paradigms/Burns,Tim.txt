  I have judged for the last 3 years

I like evidece that either supports your position or dislodges your opponents positions.
I prefer fewer strong solid arguments, over many weak arguments. One or two strong arguments that are well presented and well defended are more convincing than many arguments that may not hold up to scrutiny.
Specific examples can strengthen and clarify a point, the opposition can generally provide an example fitting within your context that disproves your argument.
I am looking for the debater who will convince me why their side should win. I believe you should speak clearly, I need to hear you and understand you, to flow it. I do not do well with speed.
Do not be rude to your opponent.
