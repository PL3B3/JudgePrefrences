  There isn't a whole lot I need to say.

I debate for Pace. I know the topic.

When you're debating:
SPEAK CLEARLY - I'll warn you if you're unclear, and if you don't improve, I won't be able to flow you
Don't be an ass in cross-ex - I don't care how agressive/wonderful you're line of questioning is, let the other person speak
Don't be blippy on theory/T - I especially like good T violations, just persuade me with normal, coherent sentences: I won't vote on simply buzzwords

A few notes:

I only decide debates on evidence when the argument in question has been debated relatively evenly by both sides in speeches/cross-ex with spoken words.

Kritiks:
When going for a K, don't read a big K overview - Just explain the terminal impact, then throw in your other tricks on line by line.

Performance/K affs:
I'm very unlikely to vote on an aff (esp. K aff) without a Topical plan text.
If you are a performance/narrative team, actually debate - you're purpose is usually sound, but I'm not convinced by an 8-minute non-responsive rant

Condo:
More than two worlds and I will likely err affirmative.

I'm not perfect. I'm guilty of some of the above myself occasionally. Just be smart.
