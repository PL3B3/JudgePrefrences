  I am a parent judge for Harrison High School in New York. I have limited experience in debate from when I was in high school, but am not up to date on debate, and am likely to hold traditional views on everything in the debate round.
  
 I will flow what I can, but you will need to speak at a slower rate than usual. 
  
 Please signpost.
 Please speak slowly and clearly.
 The better the speaker, the better I understand.
 Please time yourselves.
  
 I will vote for the debater who persuades me more. You should not pref me unless you are highly persuasive.
