  I am an old school LD judge. I look to a framework emphasizing traditional value debate. I believe the primary purpose of Lincoln Douglas Debate is to teach students how to effectively communicate and persuade an audience. However, I will not vote against a progressive debater if she seeks to win by persuading rather than confusing her opponent. I generally gauge a speaker's effectiveness by her implementation of Aristotle's rhetorical triangle (ethos, logos, pathos) in the thoughtful appeal to a value, criterion, and supporting contentions.
