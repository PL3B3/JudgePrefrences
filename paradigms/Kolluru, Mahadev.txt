  I have been judging LD and Speech events at different Bay Area competitions including Santa Clara and Stanford over past 2 years.

My philosophy is very straight-forward:

1. Participants can ask Judges their preferences before the debate starts.2. Debaters need to be courteous to and respectful of their opponents - no personal attacks.3. I am OK if debaters want to spread, though am not a big fan. Participants are free to ask this question before start of competition.4. Debaters can make any relevant points substantiated with evidence to support their argument, within the guidelines stipulated by the competition organizers.5. Prefer debaters to summarize their viewpoints supporting their AFF/NEG stand, before concluding their argument.6. I do follow their debate flows, and monitor dropped lines of thought. Will not readmit dropped flows, in accordance with contest rules.
