  5 Easy Steps to get a W:

1) Don't spread. I can't process it. Please don't do this to me.
2) Have a well constructed case. How does your cards relate to your value? Why is your value important?
3) Use your time wisely. I refuse to follow the LD time format. I think it is inefficient after hearing so many off topic cross examination questions. I give 16 minutes for each person.
Plan ahead on what sections you want to spend more time on, and what sections you want to spend less time on.
4) Pick out unreasonable generalizations & impacts. I am really picky with these. It is your job to pick out some of the unreasonable claims your opponent is making.
5) Have fun. Sell it to me that you really like debating. Be aggressive, yet respectful.
