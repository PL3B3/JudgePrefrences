  I am a first year debater on the Binghamton Speech and Debate Team. My partner and I won our first novice tournament. Since then I have been debating mostly in JV, and I have debated in Open once so far. 
Although I am new to the debate community, I believe I have learned a lot. I view the spaces where debates take place as educational environments, not just for the debaters but also for the judges and spectators.
I approach each debate with an open mind and will judge accordingly to the role of the ballot and how you frame the debate. The one thing I will ask, however, is to slow down when you read your ROB and framing arguments.
Although I specialize in critical debate, this does NOT mean I will not vote on framework, counterplans, disads, etc. If you paint me a clear picture and impact out your arguments then you have my favor! 
Although I am very detail oriented, I like it when teams can give me the “big picture;” it makes my job easier and the debate smoother for everyone.
I will award high speaks to those who take the time to make their arguments clear and warranted out well. This includes… slowing down on analytics and taglines. 
I do not tolerate discriminatory or abusive language because I do not believe such language to be educational. I may lower your speaks up to -1.5 points and will strongly consider voting for the opposing team.
