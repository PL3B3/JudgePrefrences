Event: CX

Judging philosophy:
1. Speed is tolerable as long as the speaker can be understood. If I cannot flow the arguments, it will be impossible to evaluate their meaning or significance.
2. In general, arguments must link to the arguments of the other side. Generic arguments that can be made about any case are not valued as much as arguments that are made specifically to the opposition's case.
3. Topicality - only when there is a clear violation.
4. Theory-based arguments are acceptable.

I debated CX when CX was the only form of debate. While I continue to be involved with the CXers on our team, I have not directly coached it for a few years. I flow and will rely on the teams to make sure their arguments are clearly formed and supported.
