3 Year Circuit LD Debater, San Dieguito Academy, currently 2 Year policy debater, Cornell University.

LD Preferences:
-Speed is fine, just be clear
-Blippy is frowned upon, but I do realize that it is LD, and Blippyness often cannot be avoided, HOWEVER do not expect me to fill in the blanks for you. It is to your extreme disadvantage to give a blippy second rebuttal. See the big paragraph below on how I vote for more of this.
-I vote how I'm asked to.
-Policy arguments, K's, Theory, all fine with me.
-I default neg, but hate doing it.

Here's how I vote. I judge the round according to which ever standard or voting mechanism I'm asked to, whether that is a value criterion, competing policies, theory, or w/e. I then vote on the most convincing argument that links. Note the word convincing. If you go top speed in your last speech and fail convince me that your offense is better than your opponents, it is likely you will lose. Do not expect to win on an argument that you spend insignificant time on. I am aware that the 2AR is short and that the 2NR is crammed into the 1NR but realize you still need to explain to me clearly how your offense operates. If you can't clearly articulate your argument it would be interventionist of me to vote in your favor, since I would have to be doing the logical work for you.

Speaks start at 30 and work their way down for problems I see with the debate. I use speaker points as a measure of debater skill rather than speaking ability, since speaker points are often used to calculate breaks and outround brackets.
