  As a Speech & Debate Coach, I can appreciate all of the events - but I would be lying if I didn't admit that LD is my favorite to judge because of the wide net it casts for an argument...while you obviously need to have case construction grounds for your argument can come in the form of philosophy, theory, empirical, etc...and since there are so many abstract concepts to substantiate it usually makes for surprising arguments!

I do not have a preference in regard to cases...traditional and tech case constructions work - as long as they are done well.

In your cases there should be some kind of framework used that's systematic for your argument...spikes/theory/k's/basic case elements should be checked that they work well together if you are layering them...I wouldn't describe myself as a tech judge because even though I will flow I don't believe the flow is absolute (sometimes there are discrepancies in what has been extended/turned/proved precedence)...

I'm comfortable with spreading - if there is an issue with understanding you I'll make sure to let you know...but please keep in mind that there are certain parts in LD cases that hold up well with speed and other areas that don't (i.e. - if you need me to understand how a philosophy or theory applies then allow me to absorb each part before cutting/rushing to the next part because those are building block arguments, so missing one part can make the whole thing fall).

I will not read full cases...it is YOUR job to communicate your case well, but I will check cards if needed.
