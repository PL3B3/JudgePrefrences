  I am a former University of Kentucky policy debater. Here are a couple of thoughts I have about debate:

My partner and I personally loved debating with a disad/CP strategy. I like watching debates where two distinct plans are compared and contrasted, especially when disads are included in the discussion.If an affirmative isn't topical, then I have no problem with you running T. I'm actually willing to vote on T if you are able to clearly explain the affirmative's T violation and specifically describe why the affirmative shouldn't be debated-- simply running through a block of general T attacks will not win you T. (This also applies to arguments like conditionality.)I'm comfortable judging kritiks, but you better be comfortable explaining them. I will not let cards make an argument that you can't defend in cross-x or in later speeches.I don't like disrespectful debaters. Please keep debate fun for everyone!
If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me before round.
