  TOC '17 Update:
 
1. I don't disclose speaks, but I will average a 28.5 at TOC. (This seems to be the median from 2016.)
2. I'm much less ideological nowadays. Though I still enjoy truth-testing, philosophy-heavy strategies more, I will do my best to make sure this preference only manifests in higher speaks.
3. I've judged twice this year, so I'm rusty at flowing. Many debaters are too unclear for me to flow. If you're in this group, you'll know because I will continually yell clear until you actually become clear. If you don't become clear, your chances for winning will tank because I rarely call for cards or backflow.
4. A few of the top debaters are too fast for me to flow when they're line-by-lining at top speed. I'll miss like a third of the arguments here. Unless you're as fast as these debaters, you only need to worry about being clear for me to get everything down.

General
 1. I don't flow arguments if I can't parse out an argument from what's said. The less warranted your argument is, the less likely I will perceive it as an attempt at an argument.
2. You need to fully explain warrants during argument interaction even if your argument is conceded.

Defaults on Substance
 1. Intuitions matter
2. Truth testing
3. Presumption goes aff. Permissibility goes neg.
4. I default strength of link weighing. If that fails, it's probability.
