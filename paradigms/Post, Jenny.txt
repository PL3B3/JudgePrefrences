  In high school I debated for Johns Creek and am now debating at UGA.

Overall:
I am partial to both policy and K affs, as long as they are well explained. Be confident, but not at someone else's expense. Try to make strategic arguments, (off the wall Kritiks and obscure theory arguments should be extremely relevant to the round if they are to be read). Speed does not bother me, but I will let you know if you are being unclear.

I will write more later :)
