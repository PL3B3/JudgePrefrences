  My Background:
I have a background in policy debate, I competed and Coached it. I also competed in Parlimentary Debate. I have coached most types of debate including LD and PF

Overview:
I am a TAB judge. I will not do the work on any argument for you. You need to give me reasons and voters on why you win that argument and why it matters.

Speed: I usually do not have a problem with speed. If I cant understand you I will either yell clear or put my pen down. Slow down for taglines. At the same time make sure your opponent can understand you. If they yell clear and you dont slow down then I will stop flowing.

Positions:
I like and will hear every position just make sure its warranted

Speaks: Usually if your doing your job high speaks come with it. A huge way to lose speaker points is to get rude your points will heavily reflect it.

Any specific questions just ask.
