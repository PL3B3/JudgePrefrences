  Don't expect me to flow and extend your arguments for you if you drop them through rebuttals.If you can't articulate well, you should be compensating by flowing well (not by throwing in the kitchen sink as fast as you can).If you can't speak fast with clarity, don't speak fast at all.Don't read a script if you can't act the part once you take your eyes off of the screen.
Critical theory is not a weapon used to obfuscate the argument beyond your opponent's capability to keep up. If you do not remain coherent in your framework, I will not flow your case.
That said, run anything and I'll entertain it. Don't be a patronising, pompous child about it.
