  To begin, I am a first year judge with a son on Brighton High's debate team. I am not experienced in the debate field but I have become familiarized with the community through my son and recognize good arguments when I see them. I prefer a traditional debate with very clear arguments for I feel progressive debate takes away from the community as a whole. To go into some specifics, as far as cross examination and crossfire go, I do pay close attention but I will ask that if you would like to use something from the CX you need to bring it up in your next speech. Beyond that I look forward to hearing your arguments and will give the round to the best debater overall. Good Luck!
