I am fine with speed, but if you are spreading you had better be clear. If I can't understand you I'll just put down my pen.

I will love you if you signpost well. Rounds are best where you go down the flow and address your opponents arguments directly on the line by line.

I enjoy a good policy round, but am fine with critical arguments. However, if you don't know what you're doing with your K and cannot articulate it well, then you may as well not run it. Same goes for theory: I enjoy a good theory round, but all too often I see it run as something where you're just flinging stuff against the wall to see what sticks. Don't do this.

I am tab and will vote on anything you say is a voter. However, your arguments better be cogent!
