  Past Experience: Debated 3 years at Jenks High School, national and local circuit.
Currently Attending The University of Texas, but no longer debating.

Philosophy: I'm pretty laid back about everything, I have no major preferences for different types of arguments, as long as you can explain and demonstrate an understanding for the arguments (specifically Kritiks) you are making. Just be clear when you speak, and have fun. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me.
