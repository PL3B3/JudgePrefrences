  I’m a student at UC Berkeley. I debated LD for Saratoga for four years both on the local and national circuits. 

Edit (1/17): 
If your opponent is going slow, please do not spread. Debate needs to be an inclusive and safe space.

Debate is your space to make arguments that you are passionate about, I will vote for literally anything you have prepared for the tournament. Being completely tabula rasa is impossible, so here are a few things you might want to know about my background in debate. 

Speed: I was never the best at flowing and I have been out of the activity for a while which means I have not heard someone talk really fast in a while. That being said, feel free to go fast- I will call clear or slow if necessary. Best solution is probably to start slow and gradually speed up. 

Theory/T: I default to competing interpretations and drop the debater. I also default that you need an RVI to win off theory (I’m not sure if offensively worded counterinterps are still a thing). I’m fine with paragraph theory in AC as long as I can actually understand what it means before the 1AR. If I didn’t flow a small spike from the AC I will reevaluate it as a new 1AR shell. 

Kritiks: If you are a k debater by all means go ahead and read your k. I am not too familiar with the literature, so some sort of summary after each card/somewhere to help me understand the premise of the arguments would help a lot. In terms of debate in general, all arguments should link to some sort of decisions calculus which tells me how to vote. 

Speaks: Speaks are based on your strategic choices and how nice/respectful you were in round.
