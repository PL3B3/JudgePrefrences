  I’m Connor Yeackley, I’m a freshman at Florida State University, and I did debate for four years at Wellington High School in West Palm Beach. I went to a bunch of national tournaments, including NSDA nationals thrice (twice in PF, once in World Schools).
I like to think I can flow pretty fast, but presentation and clarity still matter to me. If I stop flowing, you should probably slow down.
I tend to like more traditional arguments, but if your links and warrants are all good, then I’ll evaluate anything you want to throw down. Also, if you want me to consider an argument as a reason to vote for you, then it has to be part of summary and final focus. You don’t have to extend terminal defense through summary though, that can just be in final focus.
I tend to be very lenient with speaker points, because I know how it feels to not break because one judge in one round thought you deserved a 25. That said, if you do something that offends me to an extreme degree, speaker points are where I will punish you. This means any kind of abuse, rudeness to your opponents, and misrepresenting evidence and arguments won’t be tolerated in a round that I’m judging.
Basically, debate the best you can, learn something in every round, and we should have fun!
