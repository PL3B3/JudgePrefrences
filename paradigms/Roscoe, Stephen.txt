  I am a parent of debaters, with ~ 1 year judging experience. Didn't debate in high school. As long as you are respectful of your opponent, I'm not too concerned about your style, but if I don't understand what point you're trying to make, I'm not going to give you much credit for it. I can listen as quickly as you can speak, but clarity is all-important. Also, I don't flow that fast.
I have decided debates on framework, but generally I don't.
I am looking for well-reasoned and supported arguments, good signposting will help you.
