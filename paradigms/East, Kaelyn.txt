I am a mainly traditional LD judge that is going to be primarily looking off of the clearest impacts of the round and how they relate to the value and criterion. I can handle speed up to fairly fast. I will listen to some non-traditional arguments as long as they are well explained. I am mainly going to be looking for clear argumentation and impact analysis.
