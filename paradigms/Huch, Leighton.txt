  I participated in LD for 4 years at Bettendorf High School in Iowa, and I now do parli debate at the University of Chicago.

I’m open to various types of argumentation in the round, as long as the position you take is explained clearly, both in terms of content and function. I’m fine with speed, but if I look confused or stop flowing (which is unlikely), that is a definite sign that you should either slow down a little or speak more clearly.

I judge on the flow, but you need to make it clear what you are winning and why that matters. You should be sure to weigh. Clash is good.

While I’m open to pretty much anything, I’m disposed to believe that theory should only be used when real abuse has happened in the round. That doesn’t mean I won’t give you the theory argument if you win it, but your speaks will probably suffer a little. If you think theory is a voter, you need to explain why.
