  My name is Escarlet Escobar, and I am currently a student at the University of Kentucky. I have been debating ever since the sixth grade, and even went to nationals in New York City. I've judged at several tournaments for the Nashville Urban Debate League. In a debate, I like to see an organized speech. I also love to see a passionate debater, who knows what they are talking about. I don't mind spreading, but just make sure you are clear. Wish everyone the best of luck!
