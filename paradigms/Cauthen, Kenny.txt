  Judges Name: Kenny Cauthen

I am a third year debater at the University of Texas at Austin. I am absolutely
fine with everyone going as fast as they want, but make sure to be clear and
allow me some time to write everything that you say. Please don't blaze
through theory blocks and don't expect me to get every single thing you say.

I try and divorce my ideological biases from debates the best that I can. I
tend to mostly debate the K in college, but that doesn't mean you should
drastically alter your strategy when debating in front of me. I would much
prefer you debate what you do best than trying to read some random strategy
that you think I might buy. I will do my best do adapt to your style so just
make good arguments.

Topicality and Theory- This is where I feel the least uncomfortable making a
decision. It's not that I don't understand the arguments, but instead I just
prefer listening to them the least. That being said, if you are going to go
for these positions in the 2NR round please "go for them" and don't just shadow
extend them.

CP's- I tend to err neg on counterplan theory, but will vote the other way if
the affirmative does a good job and invests enough time into it.

Kritiks- This is where I most comfortable simply because I have read most of the
literature. Make sure that you can explain how the alternative is competitive
with the aff. Don't just assume I know everything about your argument. I
prefer to see in-depth link analysis instead of the negative just reading more
evidence in the block.

Other than those things have fun and feel free to ask any questions you may have
about my judge styles.
