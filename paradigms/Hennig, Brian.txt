Topicality: running T is fine, just make sure there is a clear link between the violation and the aff case. Aff if you can prove that the neg's violation doesn't link or your interpretation is better you will win T.

Kritik: Please know your kritik. If you don't know it well or don't understand it...don't run it.

Counterplans: running a CP is fine. Net benefits is all I'm sayin' here...

Disad: Disads are fine, but please don't have your impact be nuclear war or human extinction. These impacts have been claimed for the past 25+ years, and we've yet to see any nuclear war or the human race becoming extinct.

Remember, above all this is a speaking event. If you don't make your points clear and present them in an understandable fashion then I can't weigh them in the round. Also, I'm not going to win the round for you, make sure you point out things you want weighed in the round. You should be clear and to the point on these.
