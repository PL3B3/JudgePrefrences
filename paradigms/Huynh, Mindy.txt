I'll try to make this short and concise so you can get everything you want in just once glace.

I debated 4 years in high school and currently attend UC Berkeley as a sophomore. Although I don't debate in college anymore, I still help coach my high school team once in awhile. Truthfully, I don't care what you run as long you explain your arguments and frame your debate at the end of the round (the 2NR and 2AR). If you don't tell me how to evaluate it the round, I'll do it my own way which involves my own take on evidence and the arguments you make. Clash, don't just repeat taglines and ignore your opponents
arguments.

I was a 1A/2N in high school and so I guess you can say I might have a little more expectation for the 2NR and also more strict with new arguments in the 1AR/2AR. Though in high school, I tend to be more critical, I don't mind other types of arguments. For kritiks, I need you to build a story and isolate the specific links to the aff instead of repeating mumbo jumbo back to me.

Speed: I'm fine with it. I'll flow the best I can but if you're unclear, then I won't be able to put it on paper.

Speaker points: Give it accordingly to your performance, but one thing I hate are rude debaters. You'll see your points flying out the door.

Any specific questions, ask me before rounds.
