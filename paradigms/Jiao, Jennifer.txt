  Hi! I'm Jennifer. I debated in high school at UC Lab and am now a first year at the University of Chicago. As someone who does not debate in college and is not coaching any high school teams, I know little about this years topic. 

Some things that might be helpful to know ~ 
1. I read mainly critical race/gender arguments in high school and that is also probably the literature I know best. 
2. This doesn't mean that I hate DAs or CPs but probably does mean you have to do more explanation on the way they interact with each other during the debate. 
3. When evaluating debates, I lean towards the side of tech then ethos. I don't like having to intervene, which probably means you want to spend time explaining how to frame the debate or impacting out arguments.
