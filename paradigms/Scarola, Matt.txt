  It's been a while. I debated for 4 years at Syosset HS ('00–'04) with moderate success, coached at Lexington HS during college (most actively from '04–'06), and taught at a few debate camps (between '04 and '08). But I'm in law school now, and since 2008 I've judged at only a handful of LD tournaments.

Please explain the decision-making structure that you want me to use to evaluate the debate, and tell me why I should be using that structure. I'm willing to vote for almost anything (including arguments with which I disagree strongly), but when rounds are unclear I tend to err against arguments that I think are both blippy and silly. 

Feel free to ask me any questions before the debate.
