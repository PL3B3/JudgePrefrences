  I vote on the flow. If an argument isn't warranted and impacted, I tend to quit flowing it. I'm willing to accept out-there arguments and kritiks, but I don't accept that a kritik or fringe argument is automatically preferable over something I've heard every round just because it demonstrates your knowledge of Hegel. I will flow speed, but, just like all human beings born with normal aural capabilities, I can only flow what is clear.
I have a long list of pet peeves, but the most important are:
-I HATE long roadmaps. I understand that you're probably going to start at the top and move down--anything different should be signposted anyway. 
-I will not extend through ink unless you clearly explain why I should.
-I almost NEVER give oral critiques unless forced.

Also, I don't think I could be called a point fairy by any standard. If I give you anything over a 28 you should feel blessed.
