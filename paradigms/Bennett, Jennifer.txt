  Hi! I debated for three years in high school in both LD and PF. I prefer more of a traditional style of debate, but I am comfortable judging other means as well. Whatever you are doing, just let me know before you begin your speech.

A few things:
Road maps are very important so I know where you are going.Speed is fine- just make sure I can understand you.I'm fine with spreading but not for the sake of it. Make sure all of your arguments are warranted and not just empty claims.Be polite to your opponents- I know we get caught up in the moment but I'll know when you've crossed a line.I'm fine with you asking to see your opponent's case- that doesn't give you an excuse not to flow, but I'd rather your cross-x not just used to clarify points in your opponent's case.If you extend an argument but do not extend it in your next speech, I will not count that extension. Also, if you are going to extend it, explain why, don't just say extend. (that means you need a claim, warrant, AND impact)I don't require voting issues, but would prefer them. Don't give me 10 voting issues, pick a couple that you feel were important in the debate and why you feel you won those particular items.Clash is important, I'd rather the debate get down to one or two arguments, rather than each other's entire cases. Make sure to weigh!Theory: Not the biggest fan, but go for it only if you feel it is appropriate.Kritiks: Will vote on it, only if you can really sell it.Explain your cards and philosphy clearly.If you say something is nonunique, you need to explain why.Overall, I want to see a legitimately good debate, not cheap ways to win.
You can ask me questions before or after the round, I'll be happy to help as best as I can!
