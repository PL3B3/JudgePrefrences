  I competed (and coached) in Value LD, Policy debate, parli, and numerous speech events throughout middle school, high school and college. 

I do my best to not fill in any blanks for the debaters. When choosing the winner I will be looking at my flow. Thus giving me clear voting issues throughout the round is very important.

If I am judging value LD I expect there to be a value clash and for the value to be pulled through on the flow throughout the debate. 

I do not appreciate speeding or spreading, especially as a tactic to outpace your competitors.
