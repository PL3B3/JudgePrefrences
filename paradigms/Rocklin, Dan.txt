  Background: I debated for Iowa City City High for four years in high school (2a/1n). More recently, I've coached for St. Paul Central since 2007, judging about 10 tournaments each year.

Theory: I guess I default to an offense defense framework, i.e. if you win the voter debate and that the theory issue is net worse for debate then I think you win the argument.

Topicality: I went for T args a bunch in the 1nr when I debated, and I might be more inclined to vote on it then your average judge. Things you need to win to win topicality- they don't meet your interpretation, your interpretation is better for debate, competing interpretations or T is a voter for some other reason.

Kritiks: I don't think I'm particularly anti-K or pro-K. We ran them a bunch in high school, but don't assume that I have any familiarity with your particular K. Also, it's frustrating when there's no framework debate.

Other things: I like it when debaters have fun and aren't mean or snippy at each other. I try to be as flow-oriented as possible, but I'm probably not the greatest flow in the world (which isn't to say that I'm a bad flow, necessarily), so be aware of that.
