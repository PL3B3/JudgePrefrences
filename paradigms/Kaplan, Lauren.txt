  This is my 8th year as an assistant coach at Maine East High School - a school in the Chicago suburbs. I took a break for a few years but have been back for the last three years. I debated at Oak Park River Forest High School also in the Chicago area and for a year at Northwestern University before ending my own debate career. I judge about 10 tournaments a year.

I will listen to any position and vote on postions irrelevant of my own personal feelings on them. Personally, I prefer policy debates but do vote on other positions including kritiks and theory. If you want to win a position for me, you need to win it - I prefer to vote for the team that does the work. That means, win your link, win your CP solvency, and especially win your impact calculus. Specific counterplans or counterplan texts are preferable. If you want me to vote on Topicality, make sure that your standards are specific and well defended.
