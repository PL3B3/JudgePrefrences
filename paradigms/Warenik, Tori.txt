  I am a lay LD judge. I will flow in round as long as I can understand your arguments. I prefer traditional LD. Signposting and off time road maps are strongly encouraged. Make it easy for me to vote for you. Finally, personal attacks do not impress me so please refrain from them. I vote for the person whose argument stands strongest at the end of the round.
