  Hello, my name is Bram Sebio-Brundage and I graduated from SWHS with Victoria Beard (class of 2015). I was in Debate all 4 years of High School where I competed in HI, Prose, Poetry, and Extemp. I qualled for State in HI and UIL Regionals in Prose my Junior year of High School and have judged at many Novice Nights since then. Most recently I judged at Foster HS which was the first tournament of the year? (I believe) Anyway I'm qualified to judge PF, LD, DX, FX, DI, Duo, Duet, Prose, Poetry, and HI. If you get a chance, shoot me an email and I'd be more than happy to judge at your tournament all day both days. :)
