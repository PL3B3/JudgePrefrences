hi im aisha i did ld debate in high school thanks for looking at my wiki it means alot 
competed nationally and locally, was a filler in an HI round once so i also think i am a qualified interp judge
my facebook is Aisha Sheikh if my paradigm is no help to you at all

if you have any questions feel free to ask me
Short-Cut:
 1: Performance/Ks - (do not just read a generic K and expect to win, framing and clear alts are very important, non topical affs r cool too)
1: Policy Arguments - (do ur thing here)
2/3: T/Theory - weigh standards ( i dont prefer these type of debates as they tend to get messy but if are confident that going for 6 minutes of T will win u the round then do it)
4: Framework - (reading 5 minutes of FW in the 1ac is boring but if you want to do it well and make it interesting)
5: Tricks (do them if you want hopefully im not completely confused)

please include me in your email chains: aishasheikh989@gmail.com. Flashing is fine as well, but make sure the document is well put together.

i do not have any defaults bc the point of debate is to debate lol, so do as you please
* w high theory/FW rounds, i tend to get distracted easily so i would definitely explain the jargon when ur author says some important shit
* trigger warnings are important please include them*

random:
- Speed is fine. Slow down on authors/tags etc. 
- I am honestly open to listening and voting on anything, as long as it is clearly explained/extended/impacted. 
- i usually give pretty high speaks in general, unless i get irritated by a messy theory debate or an idiotic, racist/homophobic etc comment

BE NICE NOBODY LIKES A BULLY

- If I look confused during your speech I probably am
- if you are funny i will give u a 30 dont be a force
