  Graduated from Ankeny in 2012. Did LD at Ankeny for 4 years. Went to a lot of regional tournaments. Haven't done anything debate-related since I graduated, so...

speed: you probably can go a little fast, but anything above 300wpm is probably too fast

theory: please run it when there's actual abuse, I hate people who run it just for the sake of running it. That being said, if the opponent doesn't tell me why it's stupid/ridiculous, I will probably vote for it

kritiks: never really understood dense philosophy, run it if you can explain it to me very well

other stuffs: 
don't be an asshole please. I didn't do debate because I was particularly good at it, but because I liked the people in it. If you purposely start just being rude or a dick to someone, I will drop you and give you a 20. 
try to make it very easy for me to judge the round. I haven't done debate-related stuff for a really long time, so don't be expecting me to keep up with all the latest trends/weird stuff everyone that's the shit nowadays. Make my life simple.

TLDR: haven't done debate for a long time, be nice.
