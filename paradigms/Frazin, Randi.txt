  I have been judging LD occasionally for the past 2 years. I consider myself to be a very lay judge

1) Speed: Please do not spread, as I do not understand spreading. If you want me to understand the arguments your present and write them down to remember, speaking at a relatively good pace.

2) Arguments: Please do not use theory - K's, counterplans, etc. I value philosophical and and evidence clashes. Make the clashes apparent and tell me why you win the round.

Overall, I believe that it is more important for the debater to persuade the judge rather than out-evidence an opponent. Good luck
