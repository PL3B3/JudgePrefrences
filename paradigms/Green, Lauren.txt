  Feel free to run whatever arguments you would like in front of me. I want to see extensions of specific warrants, not just the author or the tag line. I am not the best at flowing author names so evidence should be referenced in another way as well. I won't vote on case defense.

I haven't judged in quite a while, so keep that in mind. 

If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask before the round begins.
