Constrained from judging: Glenbrook North - I debated LD during my four years at Glenbrook North High School.
I will make my decision based on arguments that link to the framework established in the round. I am indifferent to how this framework is established, as long as it is coherent. Weighing mechanisms are necessary to tell me why I should evaluate your impacts over your opponents'.

I will not vote on any arguments that I do not understand. Explain concepts thoroughly if you choose to run something philosophically complicated.

Be clear and warrant your arguments. If I am not flowing something you think I should be flowing, it means that you are probably not being clear or the warrant in the argument isn't explicit. Speed does not always make the debate more intense and you should not try to speak fast unless you feel it necessary to do so. In other words, substantive arguments are better than five blippy responses to each argument.

If you choose to engage in theory debate, you need to provide clear standards for why I should vote on theory. You should also explain why it is necessary to run theory in the round. Theory arguments must be warranted. I do not believe in judge intervention; so saying your opponents' arguments are abusive is not enough for me to vote for you â€“ even if I think it's true.
