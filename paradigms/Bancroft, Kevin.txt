  I've heard all your args before, here are the pre-reqs to a functional debate:
 
1.Clipping. 
A. Definition: You must be able to say "I read all the underlined" or "I read all the highlighted" when you hand a card over.
B.Marking: If you mark a card you will take prep after your speech to send a marked version of your speech doc to the other team. 
C.Clipping "even just a little bit": If you skip a word you are clipping. I will warn you with a "clear!", but if it continues I cannot give you a ballot. 
 


2.Speech Docs
A. Definition: Speech Docs make your evidence available to the team as it is read. 
B. Origin: In paper debate one would hand the evidence to the opponent after reading it. In paperless the only way to accomplish this same goal is to send the speech doc ahead of time. 
C. Incomplete speech docs: If you read cards which were not made available to the other team, then when you finish your speech prep will start until those cards are sent to the other team. 
D. Prep: Prep stops when the email is sent or the flash drive is pulled out of the computer. 


Debate background: I debated in high school(New Trier). I returned to the activity after getting some degrees and have been coaching/judging often for 7 years now. (was Niles West, now Chattahoochee)
