  I was a policy debater through high school, and am currently a sophomore in college. I expect a winning team to set up a coherent argument. This means you need to tell me what needs to be proved to win this debate, prove it to me, and tell me that you've proved it. I don't use tallies of any sort to pick sides; I will vote according to which side has convinced me that they have won. From individual speakers, I enjoy sportsmanship as well as competition, and wit will win me over. Also, I prefer excellent communication to an overabundance of words, so do not sacrifice clarity for rapidity.
