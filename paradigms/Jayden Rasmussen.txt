  I don't care what you want to debate as long as you debate it well and you genuinely enjoy that debate, there's nothing worse than watching 4 people argue about something they all hate. 

I also realize you only really come to these pages to find my biases towards arguments, so here goes. 
Criticisms - I like more nuanced criticisms, but I'll just as easily vote on state bad, or militarism bad or whatever hippie shenanigans you're reading. Now, you are just about always going to win a link, so for me it's better to do more work on the framework/alternative. 

Disadvantages - Please Please Please do actual impact comparison. Politics is one of my favorite arguments, and I like to think I'm pretty up to date with everything happening now, but you absolutely have to win the impact comparison to win the disadvantage. 

Counterplans - I'm not really a counterplan debater but if you think you can win it, read it. I'm also on the fence whether you need a solvency advocate or not or whether you need to have functional/textual competition, so don't be afraid of the theory debate around me.

Theory - One of the best parts about debate is that you can say it's bad/good while you are in the activity. Use it strategically, be a terrorist and get to an impact. 

As a final sidenote, sexism and racism are pretty messed up so don't be sexist or racist while debating, I have a really low threshold on these kinds of arguments.
