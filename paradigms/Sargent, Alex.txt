  I debated for 5 years through middle and high school, so I'm familiar with most of the theory and jargon LD debate. However, I'm not a fan of using theory or jargon as a means of winning. Theory should be use to clarify the round and make it more fair, not to back your opponent into a corner. 

I normally decide the round based on contentions and their refutation. Values are important as a theme for your case, but I will ultimately vote on how your philosophy fully plays out, as demonstrated in your contentions.

Dropped arguments aren't extremely important. Obviously, if you drop a major argument, that's going to count against you. However, I prefer to see depth of argumentation rather than covering every point shallowly.

Also, tell me why you should win. If there's a point you think is important enough for me to decide the round on, let me know. I'll take these into account.

Finally, I prefer a relatively quick speaking style, so long as I can still understand you. I am a very readable judge, so it should be clear if you're going too fast.

Best of luck!
