  I debated for Towson University. I did non-traditional debate. With that being said run traditional policy arguments at your own risk, but if I don't understand what I'm voting for, I'm very likely not to vote (this goes for K debates as well). 

If the K is what you like, do that; give me links and impacts and tell me how those impacts interact with everything else going on in the round (needs to be explained thoroughly). A good 2AR/2NR tells me how I vote and why I vote that way. 

Make sure you don't assume I have read your literature or know what you are talking about because that will affect how I judge the round, I won't do work for you. 

Framework/ROB comes first--unless debaters tell me otherwise.

I do not prefer theory or high theory debates, so run them at your own risk. If you run it, break it down, don’t assume I know what you’re talking about. 
In general, don't leave me to my own devices as my opinions on certain arguments tend to occasionally shift or be somewhat different than the norm. Tell me how to vote and I'll vote.

If you're spreading, make sure that you don't lose clarity and I'll warn you once but after that it will affect your speaker points. I would prefer you don’t spread.
