  I was graduated from the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School and I debated with the Walt Whitman team for the past 3 years. I competed at TOC twice and was an octofinalist my senior year. I am now a coach at Palo Alto High School in CA.

I understand most practices common in debate (theory, speed, etc), so don't worry about that. I don’t have a strong preference for which arguments you run- just do what you are comfortable with/good at. I’ll probably nod or look enthusiastic when I like your arguments and look confused when I have no idea what you are saying, so you should occasionally look up. Other than that just have fun.

Also, please be nice to each other. There is no reason to personally attack your opponent in round. I will give you low speaks and might even drop you if you can't be nice.
