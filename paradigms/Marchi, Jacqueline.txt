  I have three years of experience in high school debate. I was a policy debater for two years and public forum for one. I'm cool with tag team cross ex, just make sure that your partner doesn't dominate. I don't like kritiks, unless they are 100% on case. You can spread, but be clear. Don't talk too fast to where your opponents and I can't follow. I want it to be a fair debate. Most importantly, have fun!
