  I debated 2 years of high school policy for Houston County high school and am currently a policy/parli debater for Mercer University. Throughout high school I mostly debated policy arguments but have recently become more inclined to critical arguments. I feel this makes me pretty unbiased but ultimately I vote for which team is winning the round. Speed should be fine but make sure you are clear on tag lines/authors. Try not to let me decide what you run, your arguments should be based off your beliefs but most of all have fun.
