Faculty and Debate Team Advisor (7 yrs)

I am an educator not a debater. I believe debate to be an extraordinary activity that provides great opportunities for developing a specific skill set. That said, I have been judging policy debate for the past 7 years and am familiar with the topics and debate terminology.

I would consider myself a "policy maker" but will vote on anything as long as you make your argument. I believe it is your responsibility to compare impacts and explain how I should vote. If I have to do the work for you, don't complain about the outcome. A good debate should have clash. Just reading lots of evidence does not impress me.

On speed, I can follow almost any speed, but be aware that if you can not spread and be clear without gulping for breath and stumbling over your words, you should slow down.

Other misc...I believe in civility! I take offense to the notion that being a part of the debate community gives students the license to be rude, disrespectful or use foul language freely.
