I prefer good ol' fashion policy debate, you know, disads and counterplans and case turns, o my!

Topicality is about competing interpretations and is a voting issue.  

Counterplans - critical to negative strategy.  I will vote for a counterplan if there is a clear net benefit that the perm doesn't capture, while solving the case (usually).  

K's - not a fan.  You can run them, but you better explain the link and implication extremely well, and how it flips the case, etc.  I have been known to vote aff on 'Case outweighs' if the K is poorly explained.

Theory - Most of these debates have devolved into who can read their blocks and who drops each others answers - this is bad.  Develop your arguments and go for one or two winners.

Most importantly, have fun!!
