  I am a lay judge and parent of a former LD/current CX debater at McClintock High School in Tempe, AZ. I've been judging LD and speech events for two years.
Topicality
In LD, I like both sides to be topical but I will grant a little bit more lee-way to the neg. I think the topics that are chosen are well thought out and usually there are many interesting arguments that can be made on either side. I will be inclined to vote on topicality but it does need to be impacted out. Keep the T short but strong.
Theory and FW
Stay away from the heavy duty theory and framework arguments. You can bring it up but do not try to win the round on it.
Ks
I will vote on a K but it will need to be explained to a higher level and impacted out more than a regular argument for me to favor it.
CPs
If the aff runs a plan then it is only fair for the neg to be able to run a CP. Make it clear how they are competitive.
How to win the round
I appreciate a good summary of voting issues, but please don't try to bully me into voting for you. A little bit of spreading is okay, I mean a little bit, but I need to be able to understand what you're saying. Be nice to your opponents. Most importantly, convince me. I like strong arguments with lots of evidence. I'm trained as a scientist, so persuade me with evidence. It's really cool if you can use something/say something that's different from what everyone else is saying, but I want it to be topical or very strongly linked to the topic.
