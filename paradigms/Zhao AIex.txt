  I debated LD for La Canada High School and qualified to the TOC three times.

POLICY
Familiar with common kritiks like neolib, security, and biopower. Please thoroughly explain your links in the context of the aff.
I'm probably best at evaluating a counterplan/DA strategy, but obviously will listen to everything else to the best of my ability.
I err neg on condo, but don't default judge kick.
Know less about the topic than you do, so please over-explain acronyms and topic-specific jargon.
LD
I default to epistemic modesty when evaluating philosophy/framework debate. "Winning framework" does not mean that I will only evaluate impacts under that framework; I will treat framework as a weighing mechanism, making certain impacts more or less important than others.
I default to debate as a comparison of advocacies - you have to win offense to your advocacy.
Explicit extensions of every card in the 1AC are not necessary. Debaters only have to explain their offense briefly if it's dropped.

*Note: there's another Alex Zhao on the wiki -- I'm probably the one judging you.
