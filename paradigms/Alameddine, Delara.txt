  I debated in high school and I'm a pretty simple judge. I prefer a basic V/VC value structure (or a straightforward burden), but if you're going to run an alternative framework, just justify it for me and explain how I evaluate impacts. I can flow reasonable speeds and will warn you once to slow down if you're going too quickly, but don't abuse speed. Slow down for important arguments, tag lines, and cites. I'm not a fan of Ks and avoid theory unless there's very clear abuse. And have fun!
