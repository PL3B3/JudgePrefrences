  I have been judging Lincoln Douglas debate very occasionally for past few years. I have very limited experience judging upper-echelon varsity debate.
 I do "flow" the debate, and carefully follow my notes. I value clear, enunciated speech, and 200 words per minute is my maximum speed allowance. I like to see good clash, and excellent research to support any argument. Quality and emphasis of argumentative points are more important than volume. When assigning speaker points, I look for respect, fluidity, tone and courtesy. Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
