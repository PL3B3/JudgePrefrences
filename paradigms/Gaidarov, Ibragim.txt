  I am a parent of one past and one current competitor on the Torrey Pines HS debate team. I've judged preliminary rounds at a number of circuit tournaments over the last few years, though not last year.

Things that will go over my head: speed, jargon, and hyper-technical debating. I also don't feel very comfortable calling for evidence after the round, if that's of importance to you.

Some other things that describe me as a judge:
-Persuasiveness, both in the substance of your arguments and in their presentation, is the most important element of debate in my opinion. I won't like a round very much if it's just debaters staring at paper and throwing arguments back and forth. I'll be much happier if it's a communication- and comparison-focused debate.
-I have a very basic understanding of flowing arguments, but not close to as complex as what I've seen debaters do during rounds. This means that concessions will have to be very clearly pointed out during rebuttals with a reference to their original location during constructives, and that the most important part of the round for you will be the big picture decision calculus during rebuttals.
-I have a general understanding of stock debate and a minimal understanding of theory, but no experience with critical arguments and kritiks.
-When assigning speaker points, I look to the overall quality of debate done by each debater, both content-wise and presentation-wise. Please don't be a jerk doing the round, and l'll deduct points if you are. I won't give lower points than a 25, and my average is usually around 27.
-Finally, I prefer to give commentary on the ballot as opposed to giving oral RFDs and disclosing.

If you have any unanswered questions, let me know before the round begins. Good luck!
