  Issues and contentions should be clearly stated.

I look for solid, coherent analysis with well developed arguments throughout the round.

Finalize your conclusion with a causal relationship to your contentions.

Convince me your analysis and conclusion is better than your opponents.

I don't handle spreading well.

Ill manners and unprofessional conduct aren't appreciated.
