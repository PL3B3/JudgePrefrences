  I am tabula rasa. Speed is fine- just no hissing and spitting. In other words, if you don't enunciate I won't understand you. Sign post. Open CX OK, open rebuttal NOT OK. Will vote on T only if it is clearly untopical- FXT is of more interest. OK with K but Alts need to be actionable. Like the new iterative discourse discussions- I have masters in Decision Theory and am tired of kids screwing it up. Do your homework- read Ward Edwards to understand SEU model, then read the most recent decision theory text you can get your hands on to see how that model has been dismissed and replaced. This will generally translate to nuke war impacts being disregarded if you don't have hard probability and direct link to nukes. Once you get more than 1 or 2 links in, the probabilities will drop to almost non-existant, even if your great aunt Susie says it's so. Again, read up on current decision theory to understand this.
