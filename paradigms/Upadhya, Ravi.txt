Princeton 2017: I havenâ€™t heard spreading in 2 months, please start slowly and work your way up. Iâ€™ll say clear 3 times before I start dropping speaks. Also, I'm done being on email chains or being flashed. If I need to see evidence, I'll call for it. It's up to you to adapt to my ears.

Background: I debated for Montville Township High School for 4 years on both the local and national circuit. I never had much success on the national circuit, so take that as you will. I graduated in 2017. 

Plans/Das/CPs
These are the arguments Iâ€™m probably most familiar and comfortable evaluating. That being said, WEIGH, WEIGH, WEIGH, WEIGH, WEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH. The more weighing=the better speaks, obviously. I'm okay with conditional arguments


Kritiks
1. I can understand most K lit. HOWEVER, if youâ€™re reading something super super super dense, please explain explain explain. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll just know what youâ€™re talking about. 
2. Make sure to specifically link your opponent to whatever the K is. If you donâ€™t, I buy any no link args automatically. 
3. Iâ€™m cool with ROB/ROJ. Please read your ROB/ROJ slowly
 a. If you run a Counter ROB/ROJ, PLEASE WEIGH
4. Performance Kâ€™s are kool

Phil
Please explain, I is stupid

Theory/T
This is the argument Iâ€™m least familiar with. I can understand basic theory, but you need to understand a few things
1. I have no defaults. Itâ€™s up to you to tell me what I should prefer if voting off the shell
2. Please be slow when reading the interp. If I donâ€™t flow it, the round wonâ€™t be enjoyable for you.
3. Donâ€™t read frivolous theory pls (things like speed bad theory). 
4. Theory in the 2AR is fine if you justify why
5. Disclosure theory? K. But please be a good shell and don't run that vs. a lone-wolf debater.
6. I suck at evaluating T

Theory vs. K
Not my place to say which comes first, youâ€™re the debaters. 

Tricks on Tricks on Tricks on Tricks
Donâ€™t mess with me. A decent spike should be well warranted and at least 10-15 seconds. If it doesnâ€™t meet those general requirements, donâ€™t read it ðŸ˜Š

Speaks
Iâ€™m not here to make it tough for you to break, I know how important speaks are. Iâ€™m generally lenient on speaks. However, a couple of things you need to keep in mind. 
1. Itâ€™s either Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, letâ€™s make debate enjoyable. Making me laugh boosts your speaker points instantly. PLEASE LET ME ENJOY THE ROUND
2. Donâ€™t be a racist/sexist/ablest jerk. I will spike your speaks so hard into the ground, my cousins in India will be able to feel the earthquake. 
3. Donâ€™t be a jerk to a novice debater please. If you run theory or some weird argument they clearly donâ€™t understand, Iâ€™ll drop your speaks and might even drop you, so donâ€™t mess with that. I've already tanked speaks once this year for that, don't make me do it again. 

Misc.
1. If something that is 100% conceded is blatantly false, I will not vote off of it. Debate is as much about education as it is about other things. This is the only type of intervention I will do. 
2. Sit, stand, do jumping jacks, sing, I don't really care. As long as what you're doing is comfortable, I'm comfortable
3. Don't be rude to me if you don't agree with my decision. Every judge has a different perspective and it is YOUR responsibility to adapt to me, not vice versa. Just because you learned something new at camp, doesn't mean I know about it. Speaks can still be changed
4. Flashing is not prep time. However, if you take an unreasonable amount of time to flash, I will restart the prep clock
5. If you are going to spread like there's no tomorrow, it would probably be best to flash me
6. Out-of-round arguments suck. Plain and simple. I really don't want to hear it. Sorry not sorry
7. Clipping cards will make you hate me for what I do. Auto L 20
8. Claim/Warrant/Impact Extensions
