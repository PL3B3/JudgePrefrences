I do not like to hear kritiks in the debate. I prefer traditional/policy-making debate. I do not want debaters to go fast – you need to go slow enough for me to flow. I am ok with open cross-x. Make your taglines clear for me. I will vote on most arguments, including Topicality, Counterplans, and theory.
