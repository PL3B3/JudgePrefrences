  My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

LOL JK…

My name is Reed Karsh. I debated policy for four years at McDowell High School in Erie, Pennsylvania. I was the 2014 Pennsylvania policy state champion so I know what I’m talking about. Fair warning I’m a first year out and I haven’t had much experience on this topic so explain your acronyms and if you make reference to current policy on oceans explain it or else I may not understand. I can handle speed. I promise I won’t let my personal biases get in the way of my evaluation of the flow. 

I feel uncomfortable with the idea that I should tell you what to run and what not to run in round. Although I’d certainly prefer to hear arguments centered on a policymaking framework (CP’s, DA’s, etc.), I’ll listen to and evaluate your kritikal arguments, but I won’t like it and you’ll probably see me roll my eyes a few times if you read them – but because whether or not I enjoy myself in round is irrelevant, I promise I won’t let my personal preferences get in the way of my evaluation of the flow. I dealt with that too much in my career to do it to you. 

In short, I'll evaluate just about any argument you read. 

I like humor in debate rounds; it’ll help your speaker points. I loath rudeness. I will not hesitate to tell you you’re being rude, nor will I hesitate to make you pay on the ballot for your rudeness. Be respectful. Be comfortable in round. Don’t be boring.
