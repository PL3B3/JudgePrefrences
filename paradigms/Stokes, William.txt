Baltimore City College High School
University of Mary Washington

I went 3-4 at the TOC my senior year of high school, so take from that what you will.

Probably the most important things you need to know when I’m judging you:
I just started judging this year and am not that familiar with the topic. This means tone down topic specific jargon and go a little slower.Ideal 2NR strategies in order of favorite to least favorite:TopicalityDA and CaseImpact turnsCP and DAKCP with internal net benefitI believe defense is a 100% takeout, but can be persuaded otherwise.I find myself usually resolving debates around questions of the internal link. I think the causal link chain to the terminal impact is usually very silly, and I find myself more often then not voting for the team that points this out.I will vote on cheap shots if:The other team doesn’t say reject the arg and not the teamThe other team only says reject the arg and not the team and concede a reason that the cheap shot has caused in round abuseI find that generic political capital links are generally unpersuasive to me. If you are running a politics disad in front of me, you should either read a focus or horsetrading link or be ready to read a lot of cards on the political exists/doesn’t exist question.I view topicality through the frame of limits, with predictability the largest internal link to limits.I think that the role of the judge regarding the k is to compare the world of the alternative to a world of the affirmative. It is very hard to persuade me otherwise, and will probably only happen when one team or another drops arguments.That said, theory arguments regarding the k like vagueness are in my opinion very persuasive solvency takeouts.My views on theoryLegit: Neg fiat, PICs, One Conditional AdvocacyMaybe Legit: Word PICs, Two Conditional Advocacies, Agent CpsNot Legit: CPs that compete on certainty, CPs that compete on immediacy, international fiat, uniform 50 state fiat, and multi-actor fiat.
