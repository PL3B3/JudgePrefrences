  I am a first year judge with a son on Lake Nona High School's debate team. I am not experienced in the debate field but I have become familiar through my son. I prefer judging speech events. I look for professionalism, respect, and courtesy to begin with. The speech must stay within time constraints and the topic must be clearly stated and delivered. I look for passion in the body language, speech, and overall delivery. I take a lot of notes and work to give the speaker as much feedback as possible. Good Luck!
