  My name is Joseph Rogers and I am a student at La Salle University in Philadelphia.
I participated in forensics in high school and have had some experience judging debate rounds. I like having a clean traditional debate.

 I want students to talk about the resolution and how one justifies their support or negation of it. Persuasion is crucial to me as a judge and a future educator; therefore, "spreading" is highly unacceptable. If I cannot understand you, I am unable to judge you adequately.
 Persuade me to vote for you and list reasons why I should do so. 

Be sure to enunciate and articulate your words so I can understand them. Use language appropriate to the case, but do not use words just to seem sophisticated. The principles of public speaking are vital and should be followed carefully. I will pay attention to what you say and will formulate my own judgement based on that.
