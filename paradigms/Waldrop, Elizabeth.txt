  I am the interp coach for Pflugerville HS.

Please don't pref me if you prefer to spread and/or read progressive arguments. I do not know the majority of the jargon that debaters use.
I rarely judge debate but when I do I judge PF, so PLEASE keep that in mind.

If you want me to make the right decision, you should debate in a very slow and traditional style. I will weigh arguments but I judge mostly on presentation.
I value good speaking skills and persuasion.
