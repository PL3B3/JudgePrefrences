  I am an LD debate coach at the high school level. I teach in public school as well as at the University of Utah debate camp in the summer.

I am fine with both traditional and progressive LD debate.

If it is traditional, I look for the strongest value/criterion argument. The argument must be supported through quality evidence. The flow of the argument is important but not usually the deciding factor. There should always be a link from any impact back to the value/criterion.

If the LD case is progressive, it must make logical sense. Speed is fine as long as it is understandable for both me as a judge and the other debater.

In both cases, there should be more offense than defense.

I appreciate punctuality, formality, and respect. Prep time starts the second there is a stall in round. Technology is fine as long as it doesn't slow the round in any way. Look at me when debating, not your partner.
