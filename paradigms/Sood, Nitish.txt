  Background
Four years debating at Alpharetta High School, Policy 
2N for four years 

Rounds
Quick Overview: Read anything – within limits (Death good, suicide rhetoric good etc will affect your speaker points) and I am not a very good judge for affs without a plan text or obscure Ks. That being said, if those are the arguments you like to read, don’t shy away from them, just be prepared to provide more explanation than you might otherwise need to. 

Ask me before rounds or email me at Nitish.Sood1@gmail.com if you have any more questions.

Quick version:
1. Be Nice and respectful!
*There is a difference between being assertive and being rude. Don’t cross that line or it will affect your speaks. 
2. Impact Calc Framing¬- This is the most important to me. Tell me how I should look at the debate. Definitely have it in the last rebuttals but start it earlier. Explain the impact, compare it with other impacts, and definitely definitely have framing issues! Framing issue debates are too often skipped or undervalued in my opinion.
3. Tech o/w Truth all the time – if the other team out-techs you even if they’re wrong, I will vote on it. Second, I think you can read any argument in debate but certain arguments like death good, racism good, suicide rhetoric good can be beaten very easily (I have a low threshold for beating them).
4. I am not the best judge for obscure Ks or Affs without a plan text, as I err towards a policy standpoint. I’ve always debated more policy-oriented and I just don’t have experience judging non-traditional arguments. 
5. Evidence Comparison- I default to how you’ve compared the evidence in your speeches. I try not to call up cards, so how you explain your evidence is how I understand it. Tell me why your evidence is better and why I should look at it first. 

T:
- Maybe my favorite type of debate.
- The 2NR and 2AR should do two things-
1. Explain how the negative’s vision of debate via their interpretation is bad and vice versa for the affirmative.
2. Impact that in terms of T’s terminal impacts. If I don’t hear a terminal impact, I don’t have a reason to vote for either side. 

DA:
- Love DA debates.
- Clear impact calc. 
- Turns case is always good, but only specific turn’s case. War turns the environment is not a good turns case. DA’s that access the internal link of the aff are the best.
- Subpointing makes flowing a lot easier – if you do this your speaker points will be rewarded. 


CP:
- Specificity is best- The more specific the better for you- make sure it is competitive.
- Multi-plank counterplans: can be abusive but I tend to err neg in counterplan theory, remember I was a 2N.
- Cutting counterplans from the 1AC is a fantastic idea, and I love teams who are able to do this. 

K:
- I am not very familiar with K literature; any traditional Ks like neolib or security I am familiar with, but if you are those one off Death K’s or K’s that make me rethink my existence I am not the best judge for you.
- If you think the aff should get to weight their case, it will be an uphill battle for you. 
- Link debate is important – pulling a generic K out of the backfiles and not contextualizing it to the aff makes it very difficult to win the debate. 
- I dislike 2NC’s that start off and just say a lot of “k tricks”- if I hear “Fiat is illusory”, “serial policy failure”, and “Floating PIK” in ten seconds, there’s a good chance I’m going to miss some arguments trying to flow those. 

Case: 
- Do some research and make it specific. Embarrassing the aff in CX is is great for speaker points. Love it.
- I encourage having DAs on case. 
*Please don’t be the team that just reads impact D- specific 1AC indicts and internal link defense will be rewarded. 


Non-Traditional Arguments

Framework:
-I think that the affirmative has to defend a topical governmental plan. I am REALLY convinced by framework arguments so please try to adapt to your judge- if you are unable too just know that it is an very big uphill battle for me.
- Framework makes the game work. 

Theory:
- DON’T BE BLIPPLY
- This needs to be impacted well by both sides of the debate
- Having more than 3 Conditional advocacies makes me err aff on condo. 
- Unless I see in-round abuse or potential abuse is insanely impacted, it’s a reason to reject the argument. 


Random
1. I love email chains. No prep time for flashing unless it gets annoying. 
2. Dont clip – automatic loss. 
3. If I don’t understand you because you’re not clear, the argument doesn’t exist.
