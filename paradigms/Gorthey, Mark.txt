  I debated LD on the local and national circuit for Westlake High School in Texas, graduating in 2013. I coached Scarsdale High School from 2014 to 2017.

I will vote on any argument so long as the conclusion follows from the premisesâ€“my primary aim is to operate under the shared assumptions held by both debaters, so I will avoid "defaulting" on any framing issue at all costs and will detest being forced to do so. I will evaluate arguments as they are presented on the flow, so I will always prioritize explicit over implicit comparison made between arguments. If you'd like me to be on an email chain, send everything to mgorthey@gmail.com.
