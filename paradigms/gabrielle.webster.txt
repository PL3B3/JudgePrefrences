Debate Experience: 2 years of Lincoln-Douglas, 4 years of Congress, and 1 of Public Forum for Foster High School.


Policy:
Although I have not debated policy debate in the past, when I am judging Policy I stay true to its judging paradigm provided by the NFL. Debaters need to be clear when presenting their arguments. Speed and intense philosophical arguments are not a problem as long as you are clear and explain enough for both me and your opponent.

 I will only evaluate arguments that have been presented in the round. I will not fill in the gaps for you; you must make the effort to win the round. As a general rule I do not accept new arguments in rebuttals. If you have a valid reason for making new arguments, you better tell me why it is warranted, and even then donâ€™t solely rely on them.
LD: 
The value is the most important thing within the round, you can't win without it. I don't like dropped arguments, and again I will not make links or fill in the flow for you. Speed is fine as long as your argument is clear. Remain cordial in CX and control the tone (volume) of your voice. 

Speech:
I am also an Extemper and Orator so the quality and content of speeches are equally important in all rounds including debates.
