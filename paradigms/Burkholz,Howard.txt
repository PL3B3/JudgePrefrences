PHILOSOPHY
Old school policy maker who likes speed and theory. Some say I am a T hack-probably!! Hates most K' but will always listen and vote on it if you drop the K or have good theory. Try right wing K's.

Very high standards of proof on internal links stories on politics and spending disads. After 25 years as a political consultant what did you expect?. I try very hard not to let my personal politics into my ballots-I stick to the flow as much as possible. I do tend to work a lot in rounds to put together a coherent rationale for my decision. I read alot of ev and try to put it together to resolve questions of of fact. The credibility of your ev is important. I have a strong preference for empirical evidence. Will usually vote for the team extending ,the most offense through the block. Tend to look first at probability in the impact calculus so intermediate impacts-death, child abuse, rape can outweigh a highly probabilistic extinction scenario.

In LD I am highly progressive-speed and theory are fine. I want impacts to the value premise-not just platitudes-show me the implications of the advocacy. For example does the aff rhetoric justify cruelty in the name of utilitarianism. Impact can be qualitative or quantitative. Give me something to weigh however you want to tell me to weigh it.

Pay attention to the criteria-I am generically an empiricist and am predisposed to measure stuff. The criteria is thus crucial to my ballot because it is the gateway to the decision calculus.
