"Extensions"

Experience: debated 4yrs in high school, judge several circuit tournaments

Style
Make arguments! Clash! Go for the line by line! Don't just say they are bad, explain why you are better than them. Do calculations. Don't get so lost in the line-by-line that you forget the big picture. Framework, voters, and paradigms are very important. 

Framework
Default on policy maker but it is up to the debaters to state what I should think/use. 

Kritiks
'Nuff Said

Theory
Clear violation/interpretation. T is Theory. 

Speed
Speed is fine as long as debaters are clear. Communicate. This is not a card off and who can read the most, if you read cards, but have no clash, how can I vote?
