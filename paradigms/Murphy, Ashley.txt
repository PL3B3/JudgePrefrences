  Run what you know/what you can do well. I am comfortable with a wide range of arguments so base your choices in the round off of what will foster the best debate. If you want me to vote for you, tell me what to vote off of and how I should evaluate it. Start impact calc early and make sure that you explain why your world is comparatively better than the one your opponent is presenting.

When it comes to argumentation, I value quality over quantity. There is very little skill required for card dumping. If you want to impress me, be strategic with what arguments you go for. Along the same lines, make sure your overall speech structure is fluid and logical.

Speed is fine but clarity is essential.

I'm not necessarily opposed to voting off of T but I'm fairly sure I haven't ever done so. You could be the first but I would advise against putting all of your eggs in that basket.

I won't nickle and dime you during prep time when it comes to flashing/sending out the email but there is a point in which you just look disorganized. Stay away from that point.

Overall, act with decorum. At its heart, debate is a persuasive activity-- while my ballot comes from the flow, your speaker points come from your ethos.
