  Background: I graduated in 2006 from Mission San Jose High School, where I did LD for four years. I'm relatively new to judging.

Speed: I'm okay with speed, but I do not believe it is fair for me to call your cards after the round if I missed something due to your speed. Go at a reasonable pace if there's something complex that you don't clearly explicate. The best case scenario is that you clearly explicate it though.

Theory: I've always found it incredibly difficult to resolve theory debates where nothing goes dropped without intervening in any way. I'm open to theory, but if I find nothing resolved out of the theory debate, I'll just move on from it.

"Wierd" arguments: I love "wierd" arguments, with the pretty much universal caveat that they must be well constructed. If comprehension of your arguments requires me to dig deep into my knowledge of philosophy from outside of the round, I'll be less inclined to give them weight. That goes for all arguments, whether you're using post-modernism or Enlightenment philosophy. Make sure everything is linked back to the resolution.

Speaker points: Don't be rude. Be a clear speaker. Have a clear structure to your arguments. Crystallize. Be entertaining to watch.
