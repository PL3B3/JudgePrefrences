Philosophy: My paradigm is very open when it goes to giving a ballot, but here are a few items that I look out for. 

1.Any argument will do. I am open to everything to you wanting it to be a stock-issue debate, to combining the speech times of all the speakers and having a round table discussion of the topic (it's happened). The only exception to this is an abuse argument; unless it is proven in-round I will not give you a ballot.
2. Topicality is enjoyable if run correctly. If it is clear then Neg is using it as a time suck, I will be more than happy to have the Aff run RVI's. That being said, I love the arguments that can be made in topicality and believe it needs to be a valid argument if made. I will vote you down on speaks if you use it clearly for only a time suck, but I will not drop a ballot for it.
3.Know your sources. If your evidence is falsified, I will drop your ballot. I like to look at certain pieces of evidence thouroughly to make sure that I can weigh the arguments. That being said, when I look at your evidence I'm not looking for it being invalid.
4. Speed is fine as long as it is appropriate, make sure you keep up the articulation and emphasize the passing of card-to-card. Going slowly through the taglines, authors, and dates are better for all of us. I will say "loud" or "clear where appropriate.
5. Critical arguments can make for an interesting debate, and a horrible one if done incorrectly. Please know what you are doing.
7. Weigh your arguments. You never know how I will weigh arguments on your behalf.
8. "Performance" cases can be a lot of fun, or the worst round either of us will have. I am completely okay with a performance Aff or Neg case as long as you are sure about your advocacy and don't deter from the debate.

Have fun and good luck!
