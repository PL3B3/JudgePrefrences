I did LD debate for four years, so I’m familiar with the jargon and structure. If you use CX-based cases (offs, theory, etc) make sure you explain them well; I’m familiar enough you can probably run them, but not enough that I’ll know what you’re doing without explanation.
I will weigh the debate as it’s presented to me—I’m happy to use values, criteria, resolutional analyses, philosophy, evidence, etc. Ideally, I’d like a clear debate, telling me what to vote on (i.e. achieving criteria/RA/other burdens as set) in the beginning of the round and following through on that in the final speech. I do flow, but if I didn’t catch it, it didn’t happen. 
I prefer a moderate, slightly faster than conversational speed, but I can flow faster so long as you enunciate and slow down on your taglines. NOTE: Spread at your own risk. I can flow pretty quickly, but keep in mind that I prefer a moderate speed and that I define how fast is too fast. I will say ‘clear’ or ‘slow’ once, if you request it at the beginning of the round. 
I will keep official time, but timing yourselves (and releasing me from time signals) makes it easier for me to flow well.
