Events Judged: Lincoln-Douglas, Public Forum, Congressional Debate

Voting Issues:
Topicality: Be resolutional; I can handle a bit of abstract reaching but it's just easier if it's resolutional.
Speed: Speed is fine as long as the speaking is clear. 
Value/Criterion: Framework is necessary to constructing a cohesive case and ultimately make arguments stronger. That being said, I don't really like when the debate is entirely an v/c debate.
Flowing: Its my job to flow and pay attention, just try and sign post when appropriate to make it a bit easier.
Use of philosophy: I love highly philosophical cases!
