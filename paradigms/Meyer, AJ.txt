  My name is AJ Meyer, I debated for Hopkins High School graduating in 2004 and qualifying for TOC that year. I currently work as an attorney and am familiar with most legal and political arguments made in debate. I have not judged debate in many years and you will be facing an uphill battle if you policy arguments like theory, plans and kritiques. Make sure you explain all your arguments clearly and explain why you win the round. I will try and be as tabula rasa as possible, but feel free to ask me any specific questions before the round.
