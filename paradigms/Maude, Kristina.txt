  I debated LD for Dowling Catholic High School for 3 years in Iowa. Instead of doing LD my senior year, I decided to focus my time on speech and PF.

General:
-Throughout my time in high school I competed on the local, state and national circuit. When asked if I was a traditional or progressive debater I would say probably more traditional. This doesn't mean I'm the equivalent of a mommy-judge, it just means I am more familiar with the traditional form of LD. That being said, feel free to run whatever you want in front of me, there is no argument I will not vote off of and I want to hear new arguments. Just know that I am not too familiar with the trends on the national circuit, critical literature and a ton of philosophy so just make sure you are explaining it well and giving me an analysis of the arguments and what is going on in the round. If I don't understand an argument or you aren't being clear about it, I wont vote on it.

-You need to have some sort of standard. I don't care if this is v/c or something else just make it clear.

- I'll evaluate anything that is well warranted, properly extended and impacts back to the standard.

- I am not a fan of hearing a bunch of reasons why I presume aff or neg apriori. If asked how I view the topic, I would say as a proposition that the affirmative has to prove true. However, I'll view other ways of interpreting it. It honestly doesn't matter though because that is the last place I want to vote and I will look for anywhere else before that.

Speed: I'm fine with speed, I can generally keep up. Just make sure you are being very clear. I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10, one being speed up I want to die to ten I have no idea what you're saying, I can flow about a 6 or a 7. I'll say clear 2 times before I'll consider dropping speaks. Please slow down for tags, authors, burdens, standards, etc.

Theory: If there is actual abuse in the round, by all means run theory. If this is the case, I will be more sympathetic to the debater running theory. Especially if you are baiting them to run theory because you know they may not be as well prepared for it. If you want to run theory just to run it, go ahead. But be warned, I am not very good at adjudicating theory and may not vote how you want me to. I usually tend to try and vote on a substantive issue if someone is not clearly running theory. 

Kritiks: I think K's are interesting and am open to hearing them. That being said I did not run them much in high school so I am not too familiar with them. I think there does need to be an alternative. If you don't have one, I would advise not running it or give me really good reasons why you don't need one. If you run a K, you need to make sure you're explaining them very well. 

Counterplans/DA's: They're fine. Yeah...that's really all I have to say about that...

Speaks: Speaks usually range from 27-30. If I enjoy the round, you're nice to your opponent, are persuasive and are making smart decisions you'll get good speaks. 30's are reserved for those who are strategic and make the round very clear for me. If you are a good debater you will at least get a 28.5. 

Random Things I May Be Annoyed With:
-Yes, I know I'm weird but I do prefer you look nice and dressed up. I wont drop speaker points but it may just make me slightly annoyed right when you walk in the room.

- Do not be rude to your opponent or act like you're better than them. Don't roll your eyes at them in cross or look at me expecting me to agree that your opponent is an idiot. It wont happen. I will drop speaker points really easily and if it's bad enough, drop you for it.

- Do not tap your pen repetitively during the round. That sounds super weird but constant tapping noises really annoy me and it will distract me from actually judging. Along those lines, if you can do the pen flip. Cool. Feel free. If you can't, accept it. And please stop dropping your pen on the ground, thanks.

-Don't argue with me after the round. You can ask me questions but arguing will do you no good, I wont change my mind. 

Other than that if you have any questions feel free to ask me before the round or at the tournament and I'd be happy to answer them.
