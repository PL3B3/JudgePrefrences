 Speed: Can flow spreading moderately yell, but will yell, "Clear!" as necessary.Off-Case Arguments, Disadvantages: These are fine.Theory (e.g., topicality, kritiks): I will accept these as long as there's (1) clear abuse established and (2) it's presented as a clear RFD in the NR.Generally, both AFF and NEG need to present clear advocacy and have position in the round, rather than simply affirming and negating.Judging paradigm: Framework. The AFF needs to have definitions and a clearly established, well-warranted framework in order to win. The NEG can challenge the AFF's definitions, framework, and contentions, but need only compromise one in order to win.
