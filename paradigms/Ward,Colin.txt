  I debated for four years at Oakwood High School and for 1 year at the University of Michigan. I have been judging high school debate for 3 years.

Disclaimer: I have not judged many rounds on this topic (2012-2013) and will be LOST if you spit a bunch of acronyms at me. I will make an effort to read some of the literature but it is the DEBATER's responsibility to communicate to the judge.

Style: I am fine with speed as long as it is clear and I don't really care about paperless. The way to lose speaker points fastest with me is to be arrogant and dickish in round. Tag Team CX is fine but i expect the partner who's CX it is to do the majority of the speaking. The fastest way to gain speaker points is to give me warrents for your arguments and to make me laugh.

Arguments: I am open to just about anything as long as it is explained well and I am told how and where to vote in the round. I am fine with theory and T and am willing to vote on these issues as long as they are impacted in round.I am fine with K's and ran them a fair amount during my time debating. My biggest issue with K's is why they matter and I will need clear impact analysis from both teams. Condo Cps and Alts are fine but you still have to win theory. If you are a performance team, I may or may not understand what you are trying to say, but it is your job to explain to me why I should vote for you.

Final Word: If you want to win my ballot tell me why your argument matters,give me warrants and a clear impact analysis at the end of the round.
