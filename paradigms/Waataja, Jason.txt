  I did policy in high school for four years.

I'll evaluate any arguments you advance, just do what you're comfortable with. Most of my preferences are pretty standard. Explain your aff well and your DAs especially well. Make sure you have an alt on the K. A dropped argument is almost always a conceded argument, but that doesn't mean you lose. Make sure you talk about your impacts in your last speech and make sure I know why you won the round. Condo will be an uphill battle with me for the aff. Dispositionality is functionally the same as conditionality.
