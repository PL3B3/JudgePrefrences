  I was an LD debater at Walt Whitman High School for 4 years. I attended the TOC twice. I don't care what kind of debate you do, but I am not well versed on complex philosophy and won't vote on something I don't understand so it may be in your best interest not to run that. That said, I have voted for complicated stuff before, so if you are good at explaining go ahead. Speed is generally fine, I will yell clear. I will vote on theory if there is clear abuse. I will not vote on theory that discusses out of round behavior (disclosure theory, etc). Don't be rude either- I'm not afraid to tank your speaks. Average speaks is around a 28.

I care a lot about warranted extensions. I will want to vote for you if you have good crystallization and weighing (also your speaks will go way up). No blips.
