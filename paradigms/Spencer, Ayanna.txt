  I am a student at Spelman College, a Dual Political Science and Philosophy Major. I was a debater for Fort Lauderdale High School, competing as a policy debater for three years and a Lincoln Douglas debater for one. I am very open to really any argument you'd like to make. I will admit I love a good critical debate, but policy oriented or traditional rounds are welcomed as well. Speed is not a problem, but I have not flowed in awhile so I suggest you start at a slower speed and build your way up. I have not judged a policy round on this year's topic (2012-2013) so I have no pre-depositions about arguments that are being run. High speaker points will be given to those that are good analytic debaters that pull away from pre-written blocks and conceptualize the round. Any further concerns can be asked before the round begins. Good luck.
