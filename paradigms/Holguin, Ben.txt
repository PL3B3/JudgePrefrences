Ben Holguin

I won't vote on non sequiturs. I won't vote on arguments I cannot explain to myself. If you're reading philosophy at more than 250 words per minute you're reading it too quickly. Speaks will go up dramatically if you manage to win in any of the following ways: i) speaking only somewhat quickly (i.e. no more than 250wpm), ii) finishing the 2n/2a within the first minute or so, iii) being very good at cx. Otherwise do what you want.
