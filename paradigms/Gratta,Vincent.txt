  I am a trained parent judge of PF, 

I will flow the debate, speed is only effective for 1st speaker, less reading and better presentation will garner more points in the flow for the entire debate. If I put my pen down it is a sign that I consider you to be "spreading" . 

I will time all debates. Please use all of your time. That goes for prep as well, it shows both practice and planning. I prefer speakers to stop mid-sentence when the timer goes off. 

Points will be deducted for new cards introduced after summaries. Arguments across the flow will be weighed favorably.

I appreciate an assertive tone and body language that is well delivered, but I do not like loud, aggressive behavior. Appearance does count and attention to detail will be appreciated.

I prefer to disclose and when time is permitting, critique.
