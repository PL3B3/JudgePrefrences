  I am a former policy debater. I therefore consider myself a flow judge.
I believe that the negative must do more than compete with the affirmative it should defend the negation of the resolution as the whole.
The debaters in the round are responsible for providing the impact framework I should use to make my decision and should then use that framework to COMPARE the implications of their advocacy to their opponent’s.
I should understand the value each debater advocates and how they access this value. I will vote for the most imperative value in terms of whether it subsumes or accesses your opponent’s value.
The most persuasive contentions include quality evidence and multiple examples.
Comparison of evidence is of the utmost importance in LD seeing as how I will not call for evidence after the debate.
