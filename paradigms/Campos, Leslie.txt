  Affiliated with the Law Magnet. Have not judged any rounds on the policy side this year (have only watched a handful), but have been judging for approximately two and a half years now. I consider myself as more of a policy maker, but I believe that stock issues are critical in the round as well.

Topicality: Mainly evaluate it based on Competing Interpretations. Don't vote on potential abuse, nor is it a reverse voter for me.
Critique/Performance: Not too strong on Ks, hardly used them when I debated. Not opposed to voting on them, but they must have an alternative and above all else be understandable. The deeper the K debate goes into the rhetoric/jargon the more likely it is that my mind will wander. Have never seen a Performance debate, but highly doubt that's the way to go with me.

If there are any more specific questions please feel free to ask me. If at any point I can't understand you in the round I'll let you know, but I'll only do that twice. If it continues then I'll stop flowing.
