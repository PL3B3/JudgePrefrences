  Hello, my name is Emily Foust. I’m am head of the forensics program at Arbor View H.S. I love speech and debate, and this is my first year coaching. In college I did parliamentary debate for all four years.


L.D. Debate Paradigm: 

General: Do as much work you can do to write the ballot for me (aside from signing it J). Be comparative! Give me analysis as to why I should look to “X” argument, before “Y” argument. Also, weigh your arguments for me; as I will not do any work for you. I will not flow blippy un-warranted spikes. DO NOT PREF. ME IF YOU ARE A THEORY DEBATER. I do not like to see theory debates.
Speed: My flowing abilities are relatively okay. But, my ability to comprehend speed is not so. Accordingly, if I am judging you, it would be in your best interest to speak at a brisk conversational speed (200-240ish wpm). If I do not understand you I will yell clear/slow/loud a maximum of 5 times (most likely 3, however). Your speaks will suffer the more times I have to say one of the listed terms. Additionally, if I do not flow an argument (probably because I had no idea what you were saying) I will not count it in the round.
Extensions: Need to have a clear articulation for claim, warrant, and impact.
Critical Arguments: If you choose to run them, do not assume I will understand them. Give me a clear implications of what the argument means for the round, and how that should influence my adjudication of the round.
Speaks: Speaks are reflective of how well I think you performed in a round. Generally, my speaks are pretty nice (Avg. 27-28).
