I am new to judging. 
Strike me if you spread; I will NOT be able to understand you. I am most familiar with the value/value criterion model. I will make a better decision if the framework is really clear. I am not familiar with policy at all so if you're going to run policy-like arguments, make sure they're extremely clear. DO NOT RUN THEORY. I value polite and professional behavior in round.
