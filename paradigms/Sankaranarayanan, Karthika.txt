  Hello, I am a parent judge. I have not had experience as a debater. English is not my first language, so please speak clearly, loudly, and please do not use complicated words. Do not assume that I know what you are talking about and convey your case in a clear manner. Please make it understandable and respect each other with manners and proper etiquette.
