  I did LD debate for four years at Coon Rapids High School. This is my third year as an assistant coach, and second year at Robbinsdale Armstrong.

I really enjoy a good value and criterion debate. Empirical arguments are great but how do I evaluate them when compared to other empirical arguments, I use the criterion debate whenever possible. I also enjoy debate rounds that look at the larger picture, not just the immediate question at hand. I want to know what the resolution is really asking, what is the deeper issues present in the resolution. I do not like it when debaters get side-trakked by stupid little issues or lose a sense of the bigger picture of the debate round. I don't want to spend 6 minutes in a 7 minute speech going over how your evidence is better. That doesn't answer the resolution in my mind and will make it a lot harder for you to win.

I'm defined as an old school judge. I want a value and criterion debate, philosophy doesn't scare me, and I don't like speed. I don't want theory, k's, or anything of the sort.

If you have any questions, just ask.
