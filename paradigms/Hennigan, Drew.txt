  My Experience:
Competitor in Student Congress from 2002-2004.Worked on the Florida Blue Key Speakers Bureau Debate tournament at the University of Florida from 2004-2008, specifically in Student Congress and Public Forum.Graduated from University of Florida in 2008.Post collegiate debate experience: Judge for FBK Speakers Bureau tournament for 3 years.Real world experience: Currently I am an administrative law judge for the State of Florida.
If you are reading this, I am most likely your judge for the Finals in LD at Speakers Bureau 2012.

What Iâ€™m looking for:
Be as clear and concise in your constructive as possible.Rebuttal is important.I will specifically be looking out for contentions that are dropped. Remember: this can win or lose a debate.
Do not speak fast JUST to speak fast.For me this comes down to clarity. I understand you have a lot you want to say, so if you do naturally speak quickly, and are clear, all is well. However, if you are fast and hard to understand it will affect my scoring. Additionally, if you are speaking quickly just to confuse your opponent and me, points will not go in your favor.
Be polite.
And lastly, have fun!
