  Quick Summary - Run whatever you want, be clear. It's your round, take advantage of it! Flow judge, give me articulated arguments. Kritiks are appreciated, warrants are awesome and irony/humor is compelling.
Background -
NPDA Debate - 3 years - Enough tournaments and practice to be very familiar with pretty much anything you can throw at me in the debate space.
Approach to Judging -
-I am pretty tabula rasa, within reason. I default to reasonability inmost debates unless there is some framework that asks me to change my perspective.
-I like high-probability, systemic impacts first and foremost. Give me real warrants and evidence I can weigh and you'll find my ballot favorable.
-I am a super responsive judge physically, so you'll know when I like arguments or if I don't get something. 
-I don't protect the flow. Calling point of orders is your job and don't be afraid to do it!
-I am a flow judge. I always walk the path of least intervention and won't extend or make arguments for you. Give me voters to refer to and it'll make my life easier.
-I like straight-up policy cases with advantages and DA's and the like. I love anything kritikal, advanatges or cases or whatever else.I am totally open to non-policy cases (value, fact) depending on how you interpret. I like topical and non-topical affs, but be careful with ID tix and other super generic non-topical advocacies. Essentially, you can do anything if you do it well and make it easy for me to follow.
-I need articulated impacts, and arguments in general. Taglines are not enough.
-I don't like arguments dropped in member speeches to be suddenly voters in rebuttals. I will let opponents POO on it.
-Let me know if there's anything I can do to make the debate space more inclusive for you. If you have any needs or preferences, I'm happy to accomodate.
Argument Prefs -
Framework - I will evaluate the round as you want me to as long as you win framework. I do default to net benes, but am totally open to other ways of viewing the round. 
Tricot - I don't believe that every round should be policy. I think that parli is already trying to morph into policy and so there is totally a place for other types of rounds. I will vote on tricot but only if the res asks for a certain type of round.
Spec -I think spec arguments are rough to win, but I'm open to them. Give me solid standards and proven ground loss and I might pick you up on it.
Topicality - I don't like time-suck T's, and I think that a lot of T arguments don't actually really impact the debate except to inhibit clash. I have a pretty high threshold for T. You need articulated ground loss usually. However, if you drop it, or any a-priori arguments, you're going to lose the debate. Just be careful.
CPs - Always a great idea. I think CP's are super underused and really effective. I like PIC debates and if you run a CP, you just need to be careful about mutual exclusivity. I don't have a problem with condo CPs.
Perms - Always go for the perm. I think the Opp has to really win the perm to have any shot in the round.
Kritiks - I am totally open to K's! I don't have a ton of background knowledge on many of the common kritiks, so you need to explain it to me thoroughly, but any form, whether it's performance, rhetoric or otherwise, I am totally cool with. Be careful of overly-generic links.
Performance Prefs -
-I personally can handle speed as long as it's clear, but if your opponents clear or slow you, I expect you accomodate them. Additionally, attempting to spread opponents out of the round will destory your speaks. 
-I couldn't care less if you sit or stand - it's your space, make yourself comfortable
-Partner communication is fine, verbally or through notes, as long as you aren't puppetting. I will only flow what the designated speaker says.
-I don't have an issue with sass or playfulness, but don't be mean to your opponents or partner. There's a fine-line between the two and if you have trouble walking it, I'd be nice to be safe.
-Use all your time if you can, but try not to be too repetitive. If you start getting too repetitive, I will probably stop writing and look up at you. If I do, move on.
-I don't think you need to yell or be overly angry to try and project confidence. At the same time, you do you.
-I will never mark you down for making jokes as long as they are in good taste. Keep me entertained if you can, either by good debate or good humor. Memes are what dreams are made of.
-If you are being sexist, racist or generally a jerk, your speaks will absolutely reflect that. You don't need to tread on eggshells, but don't be a misogynist, racist person.
