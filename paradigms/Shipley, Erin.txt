  I debated policy at New Trier for 4 years, but I am not familiar with the transportation topic, don't want to inconvenience anyone, just fair warning.

 I don't have strong argument preferences, go for what you're good at.

 T- This can be a great strategic choice as long as your standards/ground loss are explained well and you're winning the flow on a technical level.

 CP Theory- Multiple conditional arguments are usually legitimate, but I have no problem voting for conditionality bad if the Aff is winning it, contextualize the theory debate get specific discussing why different negative arguments are worse.

 K- No problems with a good K debate, but don't assume I'm familiar with the lit base. Make sure you're giving a good overview, it'll help me as a judge, and help with 2NR/2AR debates.

 If you have any other questions I'll answer anything in round.

 Thanks.
