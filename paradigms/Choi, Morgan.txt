General:
- I'm down for any style of debate, as long as its well explained. 
- Smart analytics can almost always beat a bad card.
- Link debates are a more important component than impact debates.
- Having framing issues is a big plus for evaluating the round.
- I'm pretty even on theory. 
- Don't be offensive / treat debaters with respect. 

Framework
- It can be a viable strategy (doesn't mean it should be your sole strategy though). 
- I don't lean any way.

Topicality
- Author quals / intent is a really big way I evaluate evidence when it comes to this. 

Disads
- they're fine, do what you want. 

Impact Turns
- a lot of fun. (A 1NC of just impact turns would be awesome) 

Critiques
- Do whatever
- Please don't have a 3+ minute overview, if you do, at least throw in some jokes / humor

Counterplans
- They're fine
- Specific PICs would be great

Theory
- 1 Condo is fine, 2 is questionable
- Perf con can be a legit voting issue 
- Really generic process CPs are probably abusive
