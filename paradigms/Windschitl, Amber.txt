  Experience: I debated for 3 years in high school and have 7 years of coaching experience. I currently coach at Robbinsdale Cooper High School in MN.

Decision Making Process: Make the standard for the round clear, tell me why to use it, and link to it. Make sure you explain things - I won’t vote on blippy or unclear arguments.

Impact all of your arguments and tell me which arguments I should look to first and why. Please weigh the major issues in the round. I love crystallization.

Theory: I’m not a fan but if there is actual abuse I’ll listen. I prefer arguments that are on topic.

Speed: I don’t like speed but if you’re clear I can handle it. If I'm not flowing that probably means I cannot understand you.

General Comments: Please use jargon judiciously. I also don’t like debaters who are rude, obnoxious, or mean and that will be reflected in speaker points (or even a loss for something truly offensive).
