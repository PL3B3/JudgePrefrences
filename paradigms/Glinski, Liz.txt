  This is my first year as assistant coach of policy debate at Garfield High School (Seattle, WA), and my first year of experience with policy debate. I have been a policy judge at four Washington circuit tournaments so far this year, so I am now reasonably comfortable with this year's topic. I consider myself to be a tabula rasa judge, meaning that I am comfortable with all types of arguments. I will equally consider policy or critical arguments on the affirmative or negative. Be sure that you are giving me strong criteria by which to judge the round, as well as good impact calculus and weighing of arguments. The more explicit you are in framing the debate for me, the less likely it is for there to be surprises about my decision.

That said, I do not have a strong background in critical theory so you should be sure to fully explain any critical arguments that you make in lay terms. I also appreciate if you slow down for me, particularly when making quick analytical arguments (e.g. theory) and for your tags.

Feel free to ask me questions before the round, to get more specific information about my thinking. However, I really do try to make the round about the arguments that you want to run rather than my own biases. Just make sure that you account for my relative newness to the activity, in terms of making sure that you fully explain your arguments rather than relying on debate abbreviations or catchy terms from critical theory.
