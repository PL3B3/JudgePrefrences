  This is my first time doing this so bare with me. For a short bit of background information I was a long term sub for 1 year (math) and I've worked as a para for several years teaching math to special education students (resource to general ed.)

First things first, no kritiks I rarely care to hear them. Secondly do not argue with me about burden or tell me that something is abusive I will usually disregard that as whining. Speaking pace is fine if you go fast but my general rule is if it becomes slurred to where words blend you are going too fast, I can not understand you and I am less likely to side with your arguement. I want evidence but not an arguement over evidence, I want aggressive questioning and trapping during CX because dominance there demonstrates good debate tactics. I want to see good clash especially where V/C are concerned (unless they are the same for both in which case who links better). I want to see all the points discussed during rebutal and hear the arguements logically simplified. I love logic and love simplification so if you can then please do. Do not refer to your opponent as "him/her" refer to as "opp case/aff/neg" and for the love of all things debate do not look at them. Last thing, do not tell me you win or why I am voting for you, if you did what you are supposed to I will vote for you without being told.
