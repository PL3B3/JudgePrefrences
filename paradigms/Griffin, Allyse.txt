 Judge type: Traditional, stock issues/real world policy but tab with kritiks/framework
 
Topicality: I love topicality, but don't kill the the value of the argument by running 7 t's on one word! I don't buy K's on a T unless other parts of the T are covered. I really don't like when theory is just used to answer standards arguments but I will still accept it as an arguement. With any theory combo or framework of competing interpretations, just get to the point and don't extend it across actually make an argument or I won't evaluate it at all.
 Theory: Not my favorite, just because of the lack of offense on the flow. Provide the offense and everything will be great! I accept all forms of theory, and highly recommend it for aff answers (don't let that be your only answer).
  
 * With both Topicality and Theory, a clear structure is absolutely necessary or I will be super lost and not be flowing.*
 Disads/Counterplans: Fantastic argument! I am up to date on my current events, so keep all inherency/uniqueness arguments really current. On the DA, cover all your bases, especially the link(s) since I buy 'zero risk' of a link. Impact calculus is a must! I will not evaluate your impacts with out them, if I don't evaluate a part of an argument to me it doesn't exist so then I'll be unhappy with an incomplete argument.
 Kritiks: I'm familar with the well known kritiks like Nietzche and Focault. Despite my knowledge of said kritikal arguments I'm unfamiliar with the literature because I don't want to be familiar with it. However, any argumentation will be accepted and Kritiks follow that guideline. Kritiks are acceptable as long as they don't have a plan attached, it then becomes a werid kritikal counterplan which will just not work out well for the negative. Clarity is really really really really important both vocally and in context. I need a K to literally be spelled out for me.Obviously do impact calculus, I feel the same way about DA impacts and K impacts. Affs can easily win me over by using real world arguments, unless the probability on the impact calc tells me otherwise. WARNING: The Alternative must be amazing or I will not value the argument.
 
Projects/non-traditional debate: Don't waste my time as a judge, your coaches time, your school's money, and your own time. The Aff must defend the resolution.
 Other random stuff:
 *Dropped arguments are true arguments, opponents don't need to harp on it.
 *There should be more debate on author quals and inherency on dates.
 *Be clear... don't sacrifice clarity for speed. WARNING: If I'm not flowing your not winning, this is a public speaking event please respect it.
 *I don't expect debaters to be best friends; however I will not tolerate rudeness.
 *I follow TFA rules, so prompting your partner is okay just don't be debating for them. I prefer no vocal prompting, please keep it quiet and written.
*Do not use the internet during a round, and I expect phones (exception: if they're timers) to be unheard and unseen.
