   
 I have been Judging debate for 5 years (in both Wisconsin and Kansas primarily) and I debated for 6 years (3 years at Kansas State) . I have seen and/or heard almost everything, and am willing to vote on all different types of arguments (provided you do the work to win that argument). I default policy maker unless you tell me to weigh the round differently. If you have any questions just ask me.
