I prefer policy debate to fact or value. Speed is okay if you're clear. I'm inclined to view logical defensive arguments highly, so "try or die" is probably not an argument to collapse to on the aff, and correspondingly, terminal defense/presumption is probably a decent negative strat in front of me. But ultimately, how and if I weigh impacts is up for debate in the round.
