  I’m going to keep this as short as possible for y’all seeing as I don’t feel my paradigms are worth two pages.

You do you.
Your arguments don’t matter to me as long you link back to the resolution.* As long as everything links, you can get as out there with it as you want. Just know what you’re doing.

*There is a high chance I will not weigh Theory or Topicality arguments unless things get real messy. So, basically, don’t waste your time with it.

Speed
I’m fine with spreading so long as you know your limits. If you don’t, I will ask you to slow down and it’ll get real embarrassing real fast. Be clear on your taglines and authors, like actually enunciate. Furthermore, slow down for arguments you think are extremely important to the round – the more I flow them, the better the round is for you.

Framework
I love it. Remember this. I will weigh the round how you want me to weigh it if you can win the framework debate.

Analysis
Don’t just walk in and expect me to accept every single card you read with no analysis from you. The concept of high school debate is education (at least to me), therefore I expect you to know what you’re talking about and prove that to me. 

Kritiks/CPs
Go for it. Please go for it.

IMPORTANT
1) LINK ALL OF YOUR ARGUMENTS
2) I absolutely do NOT do any work for you. If you fail to analyze your own arguments or provide reason as to why they matter I will NOT weigh them in my decision – no matter how clear as day they may be to your mom. I refuse to intervene in any way, you need to convince me why I should vote for you or else I won’t vote for you. I’m not going to bail you out. Simple as that.

To sum it all up, I’m a fairly easy going judge so long as you follow my paradigms. But then again, I suppose that applies to all judges. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.
