  Benjamin N. Cardozo ‘13 
Boston College ‘17

I debated on the circuit my junior and senior years of high school, and do policy in college now. 

Speed: Go as fast as you want but please slow down for tags, emphasize specific parts of the card that you want me to flow emphatically, and use variations in your voice. If you are incomprehensible, I will yell clear once and try to flow to the best of my ability from then on. 

Theory/Topicality: I default to competing interpretations. That doesn’t mean you can make arguments for why I should evaluate theory under reasonability; I am very receptive to arguments on every part of the shell. Justify why fairness and education are voters, and tell me specifically what you want me to do to punish the other debater (e.g. drop the arg or drop the debater). RVI’s are cool. I also won’t tank your speaks for initiating theory. I will boost your speaks if you are able to win the theory debate without the use of an RVI. 

Policy Arguments: I like policy arguments quite a lot. Feel free to run Plans, DA’s, CP’s, etc. I despise multiple negative advocacies and am very willing to pull the trigger on condo bad. 

Kritiks: I’ve become much more exposed to K’s on the college level and am comfortable evaluating them. With that said, make sure you have firm links to the 1AC and an alternative text. 

Micropolitical Positions: Advocating non-topical actions should be involved with their movement outside of debate. If you fail to do thisand your opponent points it out, you will have a hard time winning my ballot. Give me a very detailed and comprehensive role of the ballot story. 

How to Get High Speaks: Be nice to your opponent, especially if he/she is new to the circuit or less experienced than you are. Don’t be condescending during cross-examination. Stand up for speeches and c-x. Make me laugh. 

Ask any other questions before round, if they haven’t been answered already by this paradigm.
