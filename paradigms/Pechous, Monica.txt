  My name is Monica and I debated at Coronado High School in Henderson, NV for 3 years (2011-2014).

I debated in LD for the majority of my high school career but am also familiar with other debates.
As an overarching principal, I prefer meaningful debates with courteous and respectful participants. I want you to run arguments you are comfortable with and are good at. I will vote on what you tell me I should.

More Information:
LD
While I mostly competed in LD with the traditional value/criterion structure, I really appreciate and enjoy progressive debate. I like kritiks, however I am probably not familiar with a lot of the literature. Please explain carefully and emphasize what is important. T is fine in cases of actual abuse. I'm not sure where I stand with RVI's so feel free to convince me one way or the other.

Policy
I am fine with all args (cp, disad, k, etc.) Speed is totally cool but make sure you don't lose clarity. I'm not familiar with topic-specific acronyms so tell me what they mean for the first time. Impact calc is important.

for all events, tell me where to vote. It is your job to convince me what is important in the round and home in on that.

I generally don't give speaks below 27 unless you're awfully rude.

Basically, just debate how you like to debate. I'm really not picky ðŸ˜Š
