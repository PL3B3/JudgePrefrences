  The best way to describe my judging philosophy is "old school". I like a good value/criterion debate. While I don't think Topicality, counterplans, kritiks and other policy shells are relevant, I do not mind good theory arguments or a progressive approach. That is as long as they support the value.

Speed is not an issue, but if I can't flow it, I can't judge it. 

I like clash. You know, debate each other, not by each other.

Be sure to weigh your arguments. I need something to vote on. Don't assume I will extend or cross apply your argument just because you tell me to. 

Not the best philosophy, but hopefully you get the point.
