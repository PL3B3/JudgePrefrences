  Background- I havenâ€™t judged any policy debates this year. I only did one year of policy in high school. I competed almost exclusively in extemporaneous speaking for the most part. I typically do a good job of flowing.

I like impact analysis

Topicality is fun

Kritiks entertain me because I'm super into social criticism, but I probably won't vote for it unless you demonstrate solvency of the aff with the alt.
