  My experience in policy was UIL in high school. I went to state my senior year. After high school, I did Parli and NFA LD for a year at Ranger College. I have been judging most weekends since 2012.

On T, I prefer proven in-round abuse.

I'm fine with critical arguments, multiple advocacies are fine if you can hang with the theory debate.

Speed is mostly fine, slower on tags and cites. I will say clear twice.

I would say I'm mostly tab, but if I'm not given a specific framework I will default to policy maker.

I'm not down with the agro-debater attitude. It makes judging less fun, stresses me out, and makes this less enjoyable for everyone, so don't please.
