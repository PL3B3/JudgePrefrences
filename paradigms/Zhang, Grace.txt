I am open-minded to all arguments; in general, I will vote for the team that I feel made the best impact analysis and clearly broke down the round to explain why they should win. I normally call for cards after the round, so make sure your card(s) are actually saying what you say they are. That being said, I prefer it when I don't have to intervene, so if there is a particularly important argument that you want to make, please slow down and explain it/weigh it against your opponents' arguments rather than just telling me to circle it on the flow and read the evidence after the round is over. As a 2N in high school, I went for T or the K a lot, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I feel more inclined to vote for these arguments. Once again, persuade me with impact calc, tell me what the role of the ballet is, make comparative analysis, answer all your opponents' arguments etc.(I'm sure you've heard all these things before) and you should be fine.

Please do not be rude to each other during rounds, and have fun!
