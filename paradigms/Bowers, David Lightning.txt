General-I very much feel like debate is not about me, it's about you. That being said, I will try and evaluate the arguments that you've made in the context they've been made as best I can. I can only make clear choices where there have been clear arguments made.

You will probably not go to fast, but make sure that tags/authors are clear.

Theory--it is easiest to evaluate via competing interpretations, that means that impacts to standards is necessary. That being said, you should read T however you want, and go for whatever framing argument you think would be best.

DA--Impact comparison pls. Also internal link comparison. And, while I'm at it, when you're extending a card idk what "author in 09" means in the context of your argument, extend a warrant from the card and why that answers whatever they read. I will prefer not to do work for you.

CP--These are fun. I probably err neg on theory absent a compelling argument otherwise.

K--Also fun, I need to know what your argument means though.

Performance--These debates are incredible to watch, that being said I'm not nearly as well versed in these as other forms of debate, but am certainly willing to watch and learn.

If you have any additional questions please e-mail me at dbowers01@sterling.edu
