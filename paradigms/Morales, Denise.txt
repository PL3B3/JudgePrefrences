  Denise Morales – Arroyo Grande HS, CA

I have been judging Policy Debate judge exclusively at the high school invitational tournament level for the past 3 years, i.e., University of Redlands, Berkeley, Stanford, CSUN, Pepperdine, Long Beach, and Santa Clara.
I believe the purpose of the debate is to answer the question of whether the affirmative’s topical proposal is superior to the status quo and all competitive alternatives. I neither sit in the policy or critical camp; I can be persuaded one either way. I more of a traditional judge but I am always impressed by well reasoned arguments that cut to the core of the resolution or can support there position. I appreciate a solid case position that clearly links the standard, arguments, and impacts.

Topicality: I am open to topicality arguments but I don’t usually vote for them. Argue your point, defend it, and move on.

Kritiks: I enjoy a hearing a good kritik and have often voted on this. Clear, effective analysis and a good strategy is the key.

Theory: I enjoy theory which is followed by discourse and a plan of argument. I will vote on this at times.

I will look for CX to be used strategically to advance the round and I will reward the speaker with higher speaker points. I flow almost any intelligent well articulated argument that is supported. I am fine with speed and spreading. It is in the debater’s best interest to signpost clearly the argument tags and author/sources during cases and rebuttals.
