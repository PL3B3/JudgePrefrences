  I am the Director of Debate at Baltimore Talent Development High School in Baltimore Md.

I have been affliated with Baltimore debate for 10 or so years. I enjoy race focused critical examinations of the topic but consider myself as an arbitrator of the truth. I do not follow traditional norms and procedures of the activity and prefer a good in depth discussion and explanation of well researched evidence.

Excessive Debate Jargon, no good
Excessive Speed, no good
Over reliance on the flow, no good

I am familiar with debate and have judged many rounds but have found myself less motivated or inclined to do so because of the above statement. That being said i can follow a good discussion of the topic. Enjoy yourself and feel free to ask specific questions.
