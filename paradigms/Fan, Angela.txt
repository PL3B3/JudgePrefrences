I debated for Stuyvesant in New York City for four years, now at Harvard. Second year judging. 

UPDATE: I support any and all Nate Silver jokes, especially if they are #natesilverfacts related and reference problems in probability

1. I debated a lot of T but am not familiar with the topic, so I don't have preconceptions about what affs are big this year or what community norms have been set for acceptable affs.

2. My ideal 2NR is disad/case. 

3. I am familiar with K literature but am not read up on people like Wilderson because that wasn't yet a thing when I debated. I think affs should present some sort of plan, at least tangentially related to the resolution. I'm not good at flowing rap songs.
