  *I dislike speed. 
*Stating that you won the debate or that I must vote for your aff/neg because of whatever is going to hurt your chances. You debate and do not tell me how to judge. 
*Pointing out that your opponent violated tournament rules is fair game. 
*Game theory is more important than "debate theory." 
*Outfoxing your opponent is more important than your well crafted prepared talking points.
