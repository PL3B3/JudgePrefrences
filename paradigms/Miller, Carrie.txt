  I was an LD debater at Mount Vernon High School for three years and now am a freshman at UW.

LD Judging Paradigm:
I would consider myself a mixture of a tabula rasa and flow judge- I will evaluate arguments based on the warrants presented, but I really appreciate and prefer a structured debate with clean extensions and a logical impact calculus looking at the affirmative and negative worlds comparatively. With that being said, I will vote on theory provided it is ran coherently and really developed well throughout the round. I am particular about evidence - it needs to be used in a way that is congruent with what the author is saying and has to contain an actual warrant and not just an assertion. I prefer a slow round to a fast one, but if you need to incorporate some element of speed into your argument just warn me ahead of time and make sure to signpost effectively/let me know where I should flow what you're saying. Flex prep time is fine.

LD Speaks Paradigm:
Generally, I think speaks are pretty arbitrary and they never factor into my RFD. However, if you: are polite/amuse me/use clever metaphors/otherwise debate in an exceptional way, I will reward that in speaker points. I don't appreciate overly aggressive debate or unbridled arrogance. Just be confident and focus on winning the round and the speaks will follow.
