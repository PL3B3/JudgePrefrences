I debated for 3 years at Millburn High School in Millburn, NJ. I debated on the national circuit, but not extensively.

- Run whatever you want as long as your arguments are logical. If I cannot understand what you're talking about, I will not vote on it. 
- Speed is fine as long as you're clear, be reasonable.
- I like debaters to be clear about voting issues at the end of the round.
- If you have any specific questions about my preferences, feel free to ask me before the round.
