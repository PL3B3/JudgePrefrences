  I debated policy for four years in high school on a small UIL circuit in East Texas. I have one year of experience on the national collegiate circuit on the Stanford debate team. Speed is fine, as long as you're clear. I love kritikal arguments, but also will weigh traditional arguments equally in the debate round. Conditional arguments are fine, as long as you're using the tool to increase the depth and quality of the debate by narrowing your arguments, and not just being abusive to the AFF. On topicality, I usually default to competing interpretations. I run a kritikal AFF, so if topicality becomes an argument, both teams need to focus on why their actor or lack of one is better. I'll listen to CPs and DAs as long as your DA doesn't link to your CP. Other than that, I'm as tabula rasa as possible. Make the debate your own, and argue something you're passionate about!
