  Background: I am in my third year of collegiate Parliamentary debate. I also attended policy debate camp at ADI.

I largely think debate is a game and thus view it as a forum to advance competing strategies.

Kritical Arguments: *I am not well versed in deep critical theory, but as long you can cohesively explain your argument, I have no predispositions to you running it on the Aff or Neg. I am also just as open to framework but would prefer that it included arguments specific to the nature of the affirmative.

Disads and Counterplans: This is the debate I am most comfortable evaluating. I love a good econ debate or well-researched topic specific disads. If your counterplan is tricky, an overview in the rebuttals will make it easier to vote for.

Theory and Topicality: Willing to vote on theory or T if properly gone for. Not a huge fan of spec.
