  Did PF freshmen year of high school, LD for 3 years after that. I'm pretty much good with ANYTHING as long as it given proper substantiation. One thing I really hate is Friedrich Nietzsche and any type of theory that you try and generate off his work. Mostly because every time I see it done, it is done very poorly while generally totally misconstruing what Nietzsche is actually saying. Avoid theory based on his work if I'm your judge. Totally fine with anything else. Other than that, the most important thing by far: avoid blippy argumentation. If you make an argument, you actually have to tell me WHY it is important and WHY it's true. If you do these things, I'll easily pick you up.
