  Experience: Debated CX for 4 years at Law Magnet and graduated in 2002. I have coached CX primarily for the last 3.5 years. I have judged LD frequently on the local Texas (TFA) circuit and occasionally UIL.

Paradigm: I do not like policy arguments in LD. The structure of LD does not allow the depth of discussion needed to properly debate counterplans and disadvantages. Moreover, these arguments often detract from the question being posed by the resolution. I prefer to hear quality clash on the substantive issues contained within the resolution. Your VC must achieve your Value. Your case has to demonstrate this. I prefer clarity to speed and if I can’t flow you, I can’t vote for you. I will tell you once to be clear. Be polite to each other or I may feel compelled to lower speaker points.
