I am more of a traditional LD judge. I don't mind speed, but if you aren't good and I Ycan't understand you, you will put yourself at a disadvantage.

The first factors I look at when weighing a round are clarity, warrants, and impacts. If I have to do too much of the interpretational work for you, you lose speaker points and credibility

I am fine with alternatives to the standard case structure, but you have to provide major clarification and justification – I don’t do any of the work for you.

Debaters who stay true to their value/criterion and incorporate them throughout the round look much better than the ones who mention a standard briefly in case and then forget all about it.

Dropping arguments will always count against you, but if you merely “extend” or refer to an argument without a STRONG warrant, impact, and link, you’ve hardly done any better. I pay a lot of attention to warrant and impact, so the logic has to be tight and sound.

Do not lie about what your opponent has said and avoid being rude. Basic.
