  My Credentials - I competed in Student Congress as well as Extemp for 3 1/2 years during high school. Doing so on both a district and state level. In high school I have won tournaments as well as placed highly at many as well. Since graduating high school I have judged dozens of tournaments and assisted in teaching some high schoolers the rules and regulations of debate here in Texas. I also competed in UIL debate for years and did that on a district as well as regional level. 

Arguments- I am accepting of all arguments. When one does however make an overreaching argument they also accept the burden of proof. Thus, I believe debaters ought have the freedom to bring forth any argument that is topic specific that they think they can prove.

Topicality - Make sure that whatever argument you are making in any type of debate is relative to the topic at hand. If you wish to go off into left field with a topic then you must make sure that you relate your statements back to the topic at all times. If you go too far into left field you will not be able to recover from that and that is a horrible way to lose a round. Don't dig your own grave. 

Behavior - In a round it is important that you are courteous to all those those in the room with you, both opponent(s) and judge(s). I dont mind things getting a little heated in the room because frankly debate is meant to be just that...a debate, a argument, a confrontation of minds and mouths. But with all of that said i can all still be done in a respectful way.

Spreading - Simply put if you wish to spread during an argument just make sure that YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!! If you try to do it and fail you will potentially lose the round just off that because it is extremely annoying when someone doesnt attempts to do it and doesnt know how to do it.
