  Lincoln Douglas Judge Philosophy

I am sorry, but I am not able to handle spreading. It is vitally important that debaters clearly state their values, criteria, and how their evidence interacts with their arguments and other evidence. Kritiks are okay provided that you go slow and explain them, but you will probably lose me with a bunch of theory arguments.



Public Forum Judge Philosophy

I value clear and persuasive communication.
I prefer a conversational speaking pace over speed.
Crossfire is not a volume contest.
I will flow your round, but I will not extend, impact, or weigh arguments if you do not.

From the NFL Guide to Public Forum:
"...The clash of ideas must be communicated in a manner persuasive to the non-specialist or “citizen judge”, i.e. a member of the American jury. The debate should:

Display solid logic, lucid reasoning, and depth of analysisUtilize evidence without being driven by itPresent a clash of ideas by countering/refuting arguments of the opposing team (rebuttal)Communicate ideas with clarity, organization, eloquence, and professional decorum
