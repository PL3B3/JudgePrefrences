Most of you all will never read these things, and so I decided to offer my specific issue judging information in the form of haiku
  
 
Email:
 Put me on the chain
 Blackdebateguy at gmail
I don't read along
 
 Affirmatives:
 You should read a plan 
 Makes debates way easier 
 My hope on deaf ears.
  
  
 K Affirmatives:
 They win tons of round 
 Negs are two years behind affs
 On bad framework args.
  
  
 Cheating:
 Infuriates me
 If you can't win, and not cheat
 Just stay the hell home
  
  
 High Theory:
 I really hate it
 It would help if I was high
 But this ain't college.
  
  
 Kritiks:
 I like simple Ks
 Complex K's make my head spin
 I'll vote on the perm.
  
 Humor:
  
 I love good laugh
 But if you're not good at it
 Please, please, please don't try
  
  
 Framework:
 It kills me inside
 Other reason teams should lose
 Than 'you can't say this'.
  
  
 Counterplans:
 Love them when they're smart
 Advocacy is important
 PICs are fine with me.
  
  
 DIsadvantages:
 Wish i heard them more
 Wish the ones I heard weren't bad
 Please do update work.
  
  
 Topicality:
 Underutilized
 Affs are bad answering it
 If you have nuance.
  
  
 Theory:
 Needs to be a check
 Abuse is gonna happen
 Theory rights the ship.
  
  
 Prep:
 Only two types of time
 They are speech and prep time
 I will let you choose.
  
  
 Speed:
 I can flow your speed
 If you can enunciate
 Most of you cannot.
  
  
 Points:
 Point inflation: Stop
 You can't just not be garbage
 And you have to ball.
  
  
 Closing
 If you have questions
 Please feel free to ask away
 I'll be the black guy
