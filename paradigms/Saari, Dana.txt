General
I was a K debater in high school, I take problem with debaters detaching themselves from their arguments and viewing the debate round as a separate worldI love K debate but will do my best to evaluate the debate fairlyUnderstand arguments as real world scenarios/theories before you understand them as debate arguments!
Arguments
Ks - high theory doesn't mean anything unless you make sense of it, these debates can get too abstracted and less relevant imo. I won't give you the benefit of doubt if I don't understand you, or I think you don't know what you're talking about. I like identity arguments and arguments that criticize debateNontraditional affs - i won't vote on a nontraditional aff just because it's nontraditional or just because I believe in it. I find that debaters running these affs can make non warranted, all encompassing claims when they know they have a k judge. Because I am familiar with and in favor of nontraditional affs, I will likely hold you to a higher standard, not the other way aroundFW - be specific please! these affs are built to criticize the type of debate you're defendingI love T debates
Speaker points
Be passionate, but don't be aggressive unless you feel like you have a reason to be, establishing your dominance in a round will not win you speaks with me ::::)))Watch ya language! We should always be mindful of our words especially in a speech activity
