  My name is Craig Swencions and I am an experianced Judge. Currently, I am an assistant LD coach to Fremont and Menlo-Atherton. I attend UC Berkeley and was nationaly ranked for ethics debate. I will vote on stock issues when I am judging Policy Debate. When I am judging LD I will vote on arguments that have quality evidence supported by sound reasoning. I like philosophical arguments. Any speed while debating is fine with me.
