  I am a student at George Mason University on the speech and debate team.

I look for clear arguments, articulate speaking, and credible sources. Very fluid judge, let the cases speak for themselves. Just because you run a T does not mean I will accept it, but also does not mean you shouldn't try. Valid arguments are always considered.
