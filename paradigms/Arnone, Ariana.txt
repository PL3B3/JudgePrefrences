TL;DR- but really, my philosophy isn’t that long. I am a college debater that loves the activity.
I will watch any debate as long as you give me a framework to evaluate the debate round.I am familiar with critical literature and performance debate as well as politics and case.I will vote on T and theory.Speed is fine- I will flow on paper.I will call for evidence if it has been put in question.Flashing does not count as prep, but do not abuse this.Be nice to your partner and the people in the debate round, your speaker points will reflect your argumentation as well as your debate presence.
Specifics:

Disads:
I like them! Case verses the status quo is awesome, with an in-depth case debate. Overviews: good. Comparative analysis: Good.

Counterplans:
PICs. Yes. I like to know that you did research and found a competitive option. Consult, actor, delay: good. Perm: good, if it’s legit.

Topicality:
Topicality debates can be easy, but they are almost always terrible and sloppy. I will vote for T if it is done well. YES, I WANT TO VOTE ON TOPICALITY, if the affirmative is untopical.

Theory:
Read it if the other team is abusive. Theory matters in round.

The K:
Read it. Go for it. I like the K to be specific and a viable option in the block.
