Number of years judging: Two Years 
Number of years I debated: Three Years 
Topic’s judged:  
It is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to save the lives of more innocent people. In a democratic society, felons ought to retain the right to vote. Public High school students in the United States ought not be required to pass standardized exit exams to graduate. Public health concerns justify compulsory immunization. Approach: I look almost exclusively to the Value-Criterion and how it is integrated into his/or her arguments throughout the debate. Impacts back to the value are important to me and when all else fails I look to vote on which side is most logical or reasonable. I like voting issues though not necessary, I will extend arguments when necessary, and I appreciate sign posting. 
Preferences: I don’t mind speed so long as the debater is comprehendible. If the debater is speaking rapidly while simultaneously using extensive vocabulary and unnecessary words then I feel as though it is a poor use of time (aka. word economy). Otherwise I think speed is fine and I would not mark down on it. 
Lack of conviction is a pet peeve of mine. Using words such as “like” or “if you don’t buy that then...” tend to annoy me as a judge.
