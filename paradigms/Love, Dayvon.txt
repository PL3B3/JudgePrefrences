Debaters should use their skills to help make the world a better place. I will vote for the team that has formulated that best strategy for making the world a better place. If your way of doing this is a traditional policy proposal that is a topical example of the resolution then do that, if your way is a radical break from the conventions of the academy, then do that.

I will not evaluate refutation, and argumentation on a strictly line-by-line basis. I flow, and I will use it, but I use the flow as a map of the flow of the arguments, and not as pseudo-technology for keeping a strict record of the debate.

I will not vote for arguments that are morally repugnant. This is a subjective criteria that includes, arguments that are assaults on the preservation of humanity. If you have questions about what this means then ask me, or send me an email.

I like depth in arguments, and not breadth. I like explanation of arguments, and not blips.
