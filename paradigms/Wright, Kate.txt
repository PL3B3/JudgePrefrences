I’m more traditional than progressive. It doesn’t mean that I won’t vote off of a progressive argument, but I don’t often. I do often vote off of framework, so make sure you win that. I am a pragmatist, so what you’re saying must make sense. You might chose to avoid terminal impacts. If I feel that your observations set unreasonable burdens on your opponents, I will not consider them in my decision. Save yourself some time by not running presume aff. 

It’s important to me to see a civil debate. I would like your behavior to be professional. In life when we need to convince someone that we’re correct, we have to apply interpersonal skills and speak respectfully even when we’re heated. Now’s a great time to start practicing. If you’re a real jerk, I will vote you down on principle.

I don’t mind a little bit of speed, but this is still a speaking event. No, I will not yell clear from the back of the room if I can’t understand you. Nor will I interrupt you if I think you’re going too fast. What I will do is stop flowing, so it might be beneficial for you to look up from what you’re reading every once in a while to see if I’m still with you. On that note, I would love to NOT see you read your case from the computer. I am of the opinion that you should print it before the tournament. It’s your case, not a card - it’s not like you’re surprised you need it. 

I really like a nicely structured debate. I appreciate a clean line by line, and I like when you clearly signpost.

Finally, clash is the most important part of debate. Don’t forget to do it!
