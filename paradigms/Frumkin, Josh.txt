  The most important factor that I will judge are your explanations of the points and cards you spread. I will NOT do any work for you, and I will NOT put any of the pieces together for you. I can handle speed, but clarity is vital; if you spread slowly and clearly you won't lose any speaker points, but if you're fast and I can't understand you then I can't judge you. Both K and Policy are fine, and I have a tentative respect for meta-debates (T, theory) so long as they're explained fully and clearly in your speeches; the only preconceived notion I hold in debate is that I won't typically vote for "switch-side debate bad", but if you argue it well it's not out of the question. I want to see clash and excitement: bonus points if you use your opponent's evidence against them. Creativity is encouraged, as is thinking on your feet. And, most importantly, I do not let my politics affect my judgment in-round. Do not assume I believe, or know, anything about the topics you plan on running in-round - like I said, clarity and explanation are the most important factors in your debate.
