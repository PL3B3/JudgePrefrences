  I am primarily a stock issues judge

Here are some basics.

Prep Time: I don't count flashing for prep, but I urge you to have your tech together before the round starts so we don't consume too much time.

Topicality: I have a high threshold for Topicality, if you're going to claim that it was a voting issue in the round you will have to work pretty hard. However, I must vote for it if it was completely dropped by the affirmative. Same applies for specs.

Kritiks: A lot of times Kritiks are won/lost because of Framework or the role of the ballot. when there are competing ROB's/Framework interpretations I am more likely to understand them at a slower pace than the usual varsity debating. Basically, for a neg running a K the less offense the aff has against you usually means you have a better shot of winning.

Counterplans: If you go for a CP at the end of the round and you lose on it. I will have to vote you down for the round even if you have a winning T flow so choose wisely which one you go for.

Disadvantages: Debaters drop uniqueness all the time and I let it pass usually. However, now that I have a wiki I am no longer voting on a DA if the neg doesn't extend it in the Neg block.

As for the Aff Stock issues the same rule applies from my statement about DA's. I also would be very careful about dropping certain harms without nulling any offense that negative may have from it.
