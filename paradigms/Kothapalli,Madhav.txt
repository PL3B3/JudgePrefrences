  I'm a parent judge (PF) for more than a year. As for my approach to rewarding performance, I appreciate a coherent argument involving excellent communication and mutual respect (without any abuse/rudeness). The debaters can speak fast as they go along. I'll be happy if debaters make a clear argument regarding the resolutions and defending them till the end.

Have fun and enjoy yourself.
