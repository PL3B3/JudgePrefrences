  Experience: 4 years debating at Bingham High School, 5 years debating at Idaho State University. 5 years coaching Pocatello High School, 1 year coaching Idaho State University.

I try my damnedest to line up all the arguments on my flow. I am, however, open to alternate flowing styles. I really do prefer when debaters make specific reference of which argument(s) they are answering at a given time regardless of flowing style. I also flow the text of cards.
I prefer not to call for evidence. This means explain, explain, explain! Tell me what the card says; tell me why I should care and how I should apply it. That being said, I do not think that cards are always better than analytics.
Be prepared to defend all aspects of your argument.
Everything is open to (re)interpretation. For example, some questions that may be relevant to my ballot include: What is the purpose of the debate space? How does this affect the way that impacts are evaluated? These kinds of top-level framing issues are the most important to me.
