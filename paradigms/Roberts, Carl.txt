  I was an LD debater in Oklahoma and also debated nationally in Public Forum.
I was brought up in a very traditional style but I will listen to some crazy stuff if you provide evidence, impacts, and a reason for the arguments existence in the round. The ultimate impact is not the holocaust or nuclear war. Just don't. Philosophy plays a big role in my judging, um, philosophy. I flow and use it to make my decisions. Cards are good when impacted. Don't just say "My Foucault Card" as a rebuttal and expect it to get you anywhere. I am looking for direct refutation and clash. Gitty Up!
