  I debated 4 years LD, with some Policy. I coached LD, PFD and Policy. I do not have the ears for speed. I prefer fewer arguments with more depth. Debates that have a value should use the value as a yard stick of winning the debate. Rebuttals should focus on winning arguments and the debaters should assign a weight to them. If not, then I will be forced to decide what is the most important arguments and choose a winner.
