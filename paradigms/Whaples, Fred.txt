  Mr. Whaples LD Debate Judging Philosophy

My personal prejudices and opinions shall be set aside for the purpose of equally considering both perspectives in each debate. I admire each of you for the courage it takes to step into each round and commend you for it!

The best argument wins, not the best sounding speaker -- this is a debate, not an interpretive event. However, passion reflects conviction of position.

I judge... YOU debate. Your style, presentation, speed, use of terminology, etc are all part of the process. If you read your notes it shows lack of knowledge (anyone can read) and you may continue staring at your notes to find your score because the one earned will be very poor. If you speak faster than a machine gun can shoot your scores will clearly reflect the same torn up target. If you try to tell me how to judge or when your opponent makes an error, I may decide to only judge your opponent and leave your score blank since you took over my role. I judge.. YOU debate.

Time is sacred. Points are precious. For this reason if you take advantage of the time by excessively going under or over, it reflects a lack of preparation. Since you took something sacred and abused it, I will take something precious to reflect this.

As your judge I will work hard to be impartial and fair. I will supply as many insights as possible. Please remember it is only ONE person's perspective. Take each comment to thought but not always to heart.

I want to talk with you, meet you, and discuss ideas of how to become stronger and better. Please approach me at any event.
