  I am a senior at SFSU, graduating this semester. I study rhetoric and communication. This is my first tournament as a judge, but I have debated for a year and a half.

1. I don't like spreading, but if you must you must. Know that I will ask you to be clear once if I can't understand what you are saying.

2. I flow during rounds but not during cross-ex, so if you want it to end up on my flow talk about it during speeches.
3. I will vote on any argument, but you need to explain it to me and how it applies to your opponents position more than you need to read cards on it.

4. Concerning speaker points: I am evaluating your performance, not your arguments on this one.
