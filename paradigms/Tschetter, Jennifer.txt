I am open minded and inclusive. I do not believe that there are wrong or right definitions of what debate should be. I do think; however, that you need to formulate both sound and valid arguments. While I do not necessarily prefer evidence to analytics, you need to have and use it properly. Speed is fine so long as you're using it to get arguments in and not just to speed. Theory is entertaining if done well. There must be clash in the round. Please be polite, there is no reason to be a jerk, we're all here to learn. Feel free to ask more in round.
