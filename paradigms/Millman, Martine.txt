  I have judged varsity Lincoln Douglas debate, mostly in central New Jersey, since 2001, but less frequently the past two years. I prefer a "humanistic" approach which emphasizes style, grace, truth seeking, and respect for the opponent and judge as free thinking individuals. I want to feel hope for the youth of America when you finish the round.

In effect, that means, be polite, use reasoning, not jargon, don't just throw a lot of cards at your opponent and hope that he/she can't catch them all. If you refer to history or current world events try to have your facts straight. Use your time to persuade me that your position is better than your opponent's based on your values and points. I am not thrilled with theory although it can occasionally be interesting.

If you appear to be more interested in reaching the truth regarding the resolution in the immediacy of the round rather than just scoring another win you will be more likely to achieve the latter, too. I will award high points for style, especially if you manage to do this with wit and humor. (Yes, I have seen this!)

If, in spite of the above, you want to spread, I will attempt to continue flowing, but I will not be happy.
