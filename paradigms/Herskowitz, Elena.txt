  University School (FL)

My name is Elena Herskowitz and my son is a PF debater at University School (FL). I started judging in the 2011-2012 school year. I love judging and think that what the students do is incredible! I judge locally for the team. I have judged LD and PF at CFLs and spend more time in the PF pool than the LD pool. I want debaters to speak clearly, persuasively, and frame the round for me. Please avoid speaking too briskly - I am not against faster delivery inherently - but I can't flow it.
