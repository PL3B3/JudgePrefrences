  This is my first year of judging LD Debate tournaments. I have judged two JV LD rounds so far this year at Wake Forest tournament. I am a lay judge not a flow judge. I cannot follow ridiculous speeds while talking.

I judge based on clarity of the debater's case presented and how well the opponent's points are tackled. Overall I go by who persuaded/convinced me more!
