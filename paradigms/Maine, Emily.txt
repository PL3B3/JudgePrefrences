  My name is Emily Maine. I've done some form of debate for the last 8 years. I've competed in NPDA parli at Cal for the last 4 years. At the 2010 NPTE I placed in the top 15 speakers and my team got to outrounds.

Overview: I come from a policy style background. That framing of arguments makes intuitive sense to me. That is not to say that you can't run other frameworks, but that those will require more explanation. I am fine with speed, if you are unclear i will tell you. I try not to interject my own views into the round as much as possible so feel free to run whatever you like; if you win it i will vote on it.
Specifics:
t/theory: I like t and theory debates. I tend to default to competing interps absent a debater giving me a standard to weigh the position. Then again if you dont give me a standard to weigh the position you're probably not doing a very good job.

Cp/ da debate: Im fine with them, i run them all the time. I think that the perm is a test of competition. If you're aff use them. If you want to run a perm as an advocacy, justify it.

K: Again go ahead, im familiar with most common k literature and arguments. If you're running something really obscure you might want to explain it more.

If you have questions feel free to ask me in round or email me emilymaine@gmail.com
