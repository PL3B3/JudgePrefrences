Please try and be as organized as possible because the less confused I am the better I can go down the line by line. Keep in mind all arguments and try your best to address them all because if one argument was said and you might not think it holds weight but I do than that work against you. I enjoy to see competition but friendly competition. And humor is enjoyable as well if appropriate. Good Luck!
