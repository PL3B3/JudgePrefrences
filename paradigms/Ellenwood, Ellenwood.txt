  I am a tab judge. I am fine with speed, theory, framework, kritiks, everything.

It's your round, do what you want, just do it well and tell me where to vote. Keep the debate organized, if you lose me on the flow, I won't have anything to vote on. My predominant event in high school was CX, so I shouldn't have a problem following you, but as a judge, I don't like to clean up after messy debaters.

I do hate it when people try to define "what LD debate is"; all the debates are just debates and you can use whatever types of arguments you want to make your points (analytics, philosophy, evidence, "cards", whatever).

All I ask is to see a good debate.
