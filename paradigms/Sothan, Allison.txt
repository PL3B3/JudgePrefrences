I won’t flow spreading. I’ll offer one “clear” but if there is no significant change I will stop flowing.

Flex PrepNo.

Speaker PointsBased on over all delivery some key factors include; standing when presenting, vocal projection, being respectful of all in the room, clarity of arguments, explanation during cx, and so on.

TimeHave access to personal timers

ArgumentsI’m willing to buy almost anything as long as it shown to be relevant to the topic and well explained. That being said, I have a harder time buying into agenda based plans and disads. I believe counterplans, and overviews etc are legitimate—unless otherwise shown. If you plan to run theory there needs to be a significant amount of detail to legitimize it— I’ve only voted on theory about once a year. I’m here for quality clash and creative arguments. 

VotingI look toward framework and impact analysis. Losing on standards won’t kill you so long as you can show how the winning v/c work for you as well and still be able to access impacts. Keeping it clear cut and sign posting is extremely important to me. Voters make things 100x easier for everyone.
