  My name is Katie and I debate policy for three years in high school in Missouri, competing in champ for two of those years. I went to debate camp and saw just about every style that people threw out there.

I am a very straightforward judge I want debaters to tell me what to vote on and why that is important. Give me the standards and then the warrents of our arguments. Please make your link stories and arguments make sense in a way that is easy to understandsand otherwise I am unlikely to vote for them. At the end of the round when I am deciding how to sign my ballot I truly believe you must have offense there is no way to win a debate otherwise because 100 percent defense is almost impossible. I am fine with theory as long as there is a clear link story and the argument is articulated well. If you are going to run any Ks make sure that the position you are expressing is coming out clearly otherwise it can get muddled in how the other team is explaing it and cost you the round. As for speed, I talk extremly fast and can understand arguments as long as they are clear fast as well. However, I am not the fastest when it comes to flowing so take it how you please.
