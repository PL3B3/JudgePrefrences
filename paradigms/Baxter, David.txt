  I am a former policy debater and have judged LD for the past 3 years.

I am familiar with this resolution and can flow the spread. However, BE CLEAR you will not be getting in the higher range of speaks if you are hard to understand.

speaks are generally pretty solid, with 27 as a mid-point i can work up or down from there.

Theory- i will vote on it, but prefer substance

As to structure, Value criterial structures are preferred, however i will default to whatever evaluative mechanism i am given

clear extensions and weighing are key in my book.


Not much else, just be a good person and have fun. That's what it's about
