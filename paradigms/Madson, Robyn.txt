  I want to see a cleanly debated round with clear standards for how I should adjudicate the round. I expect a warrant and impact for all claims, and a well defined crystallization of the arguments at the end of the debate. I will judge based on the information in the round only. I think people would call me more traditional in how I judge debate, however, the most important issue is that you communicate the story of your case, how it all fits together, and why it is stronger than the opponent's.

The arguments in the round are the most important part of the debate, but since it is a communicative activity, I expect the speaking to be clear, well enunciated, and intelligible. Speaking so quickly that one is foaming at the mouth is not only discouraged, but disgusting. For many of the folks debating, this is going to mean that you have to slow down.
