  While I'm a relatively new judge I have very defined views on what makes a winning debate. 

Presentation:
 In General I believe protocols such as dress, presentation and professionalism are important but these do not win debates. Despite the previous statement, human nature is such that more weight will be given to an individual who dresses and acts in a professional manner. Further arguments can only win cases if the information that is conveyed is understood. While I have no problem with spreading, in general I find only about 50% of the individuals who use it are capable of articulation at a level that can still be understood. Spreading is an effective tool for delivering more information in a limited amount of time. In the rush to deliver the message, the speaker should always weigh whether the additional information is strong enough to out-weigh the chance that some of their arguments may be not be decipherable. When all other things are equal the presentation and professionalism are the factors which break ties.

Arguments:
A debate is won on the merits of the arguments made. The arguments should be presented in logical structured order and be backed by references which are themselves credible. A statement is not a fact because a large number of people support it or believe it. A statement is not a fact because the author of the statement is a prominent individual. A fact is not false because the speaker is of low moral character. Arguments win debates and winning arguments are based on facts that can be supported by empirical data, preferably from more than one source.

Concessions:
Always be very careful on any issues you concede. I have seen a winning team lose a debate because they conceded their opponents argument when the argument was clearly flawed. Once you concede an argument the opposing team wins the point even if I believe your stance was more credible.
