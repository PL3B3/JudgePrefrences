  David Elwell's paradigm (LD) - I am a lawyer, and my preference is for Traditional LD. I do not believe Progressive LD is skillful when speed overshadows the content and argument. The debate will be flowed. The well organized & best supported argument is most likely to prevail. Courtesy and respect of your opponent and his/her arguments is expected at all times
