  I debated for Cypress Woods in Houston, TX. I went to the TOC with three bids, the TFA state tournament, and NFL nationals. I loved my time in debate and value it as an educational activity above all else. In general, I'm open to any argument as long as there is a warrant and a mechanism to weigh the impact through. 

To address specific issues:

Theory: I do not like rounds that devolve into heavy theory debates, so if you spend the majority of your speech time arguing theory rather than substance I will be disappointed. I am sympathetic to arguments that claim theory is an RVI. Shells must have an interpretation, violation, standards, and how theory should factor into my decision. 

Speed: If I can't understand what you're saying I will let you know. 

Presumption: If there is no offense in the round I will vote for the debater that requires me to do the least amount of intervention unless I'm told to do otherwise in the round. If I vote for you on presumption, your speaker points will reflect that. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY: If you want my ballot, take time to weigh arguments and explain to me what is important. Establish a mechanism for me to evaluate offense through, and then tell me what piece of offense is most important under that mechanism. If you do this better than your opponent, you will probably win. 

Feel free to ask questions before the round.
