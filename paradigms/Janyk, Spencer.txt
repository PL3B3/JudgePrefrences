  I debated stock policy for four years of high school at Sehome High School in Bellingham, WA under Casey Binz and Jeff Shaw. Class of 2006.
In college I debated for Whitman College for all four years under Jim Hanson and Aaron Hardy - that pedigree doesn't reflect my style, however, which more closely resembled Derridean deconstruction and Foucaultian genealogy/critique. I spent most of my time wishing that the SF State squad traveled with us so I could hang out with them. Class of 2010.
I was a Gender Studies major at Whitman, and went on to complete my MA in Performance Studies at New York University.
I'm currently a web dev and operations manager at a startup in SoMa.
I feel comfortable with as much pomo nonsense or light-speed politics as you'd like to spew at me, but I prefer coherent stories, reasoned analysis and passionate performance.
You'll have a hard time convincing me that conditionality is bad, or that affs should spec their A - so go for the impact turns. They're much more fun.
Do mock your opponents for making bad arguments and having worse haircuts, but for the love of all that's good, don't do it in a racist/heteronormative/ableist way.
