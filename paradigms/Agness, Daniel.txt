  I debated for four years at Nevada Union High School in Northern California. I graduated in 2010. I have relatively minimal judging experience, but am fine with any type of argument. I am Tabula Rasa but defer to a policy making paradigm. I love T and will vote for theory so long as it is well explained and there is some kind of impact calculus. Finally, if you are running a very kritiky-type performance aff, slow down a little and make sure that it is well explained.
