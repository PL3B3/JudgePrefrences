  
I'd prefer to be called Adam.
I competed in national circuit LD at Stuyvesant High School in NYC for 3 years. I now attend Wesleyan University. 

My email is mrahman@wesleyan.edu if you have any questions or want to email me your speech doc for viewing.
Slow down on tags and citations, deliver clear overviews and extensions, and interact well with opposing arguments.
Doing this will net you good speaker points regardless of your stylistic preferences. I can adjudicate Kritik , LARP, framework, traditional, theory and substance heavy debates just fine.
I have experience in both progressive and traditional circuits,and will be able to judge and enjoy whatever style both debaters engage in. 
For novice / JV / less experienced: Do whatever makes you comfortable. If that means experimenting, speaking at a normal pace, opting for more traditional arguments, whatever. I want your rounds to be both a learning experience and taste of competition.


Speaks start at 28.5 and scale up or down based on performance, I reward points based on strategy, and I don't scale down often.
