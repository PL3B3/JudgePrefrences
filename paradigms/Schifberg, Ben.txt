  I did LD for four years at South Eugene High School.

I try to be as tab as possible. I will evaluate the round however you tell me to. Go as fast as you want, I'll yell "clear" if I can't understand you. I give out speaks based on the quality of your argumentation, interesting arguments and/or debate skill will get you high speaks.
