  Speed: 
I just want you to slow a lot on authors / tags. Other than that if you want me to flow something either slow down or emphasize on it. But other than that go as fast as you want 
Argumentation:
Run whatever you want although fair warning if you are running theory there needs to be pretty blatant abuse otherwise I have a hard time voting for it. As far as other arguments I'm fine, with the exception of Alts of kritiks. I'm of the assumption that the alt should be an action so a reject alt just doesn't do it for me most times. Not saying I won't vote for a reject alt, but it's going to take more work on your part. 
Speaks:
I start a 27 and go up or down. If you are on a bubble round though tell me and I'll bump up your speaks. If you bring me an originally created Pepe I haven't seen before I might bump your speaks.
Side note:
I really really like underviews. They can be short like literally 10-15 seconds but if you are running like high theory kâ€™s or philosophy or whatever an underview will make me more likely to understand you. Other than that I'm not doing any work for you and I'm probably gonna vote whichever way gives me the easiest ballot.
