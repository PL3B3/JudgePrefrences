I have judged just about everything possible - and I like to keep my events separate...don't bring a counter-plan to LD or value C. to PF...

In a nutshell, I am pretty flexible judge. I'm more interested in how well you debate then petty things, some tend to get caught up in.

-I am ok with some speed as long as it does not become policy and your opponent can clearly understand you. 
-Clear and organized rebuttals are important to me. Don't assume anything - explain it. 
-I always appreciate a breakdown of voting issues, towards the end of course.
-I expect that both debaters will be civil to each other but do not be afraid to get aggressive...I like nothing more then an intense and though provoking CX
-I encourage you to time yourselves but my timer will be the final word. 

In the end, have fun and kick-butt. Give me a good round filled with logic & intellectual thought and your sure to win!
