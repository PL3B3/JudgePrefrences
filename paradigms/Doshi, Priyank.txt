  I competed in Lincoln-Douglas and Congressional Debate for four years at Schaumburg High School. I prefer clearly articulated values and value criteria and contentions that link clearly to that structure. In terms of delivery, I prefer a reasonable rate of speed and clear speaking. In terms of content, I am open to different types of arguments as long as they are clear and well-justified.
