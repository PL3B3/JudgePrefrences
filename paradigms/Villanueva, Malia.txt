  I did policy debate and speech in high school. I am currently a Novice/JV debater at the University of West Georgia.

General: Don’t run arguments that you don’t understand. My biggest pet peeve is someone not being able to explain their own argument. Don’t run something in my round just because I say I like it. If you aren’t good at that type of debate, don’t risk the round. Please don’t argue with me about the RFD and please don’t be offensive, I will dock speaks.

K: I’m relatively comfortable with K’s but I really expect you to explain the link and make it very clear. I also want a good, clear explanation of the alt. If the alt isn’t clear, why should I weigh the K?

Theory: I have a pretty high threshold for theory. I’m willing to vote on condo but make sure you’re clear on why it’s a voting issue.

CP: I’m pretty cool with CP debate. Make sure the net benefits are clear because I really think CP debate is pointless if no one clarifies the net benefits.

T: I love T debate! I’m a T debater myself. Make sure you make the Voting Issue clear and make sure you make it obvious why your interpretation is better. If done correctly, i usually err neg on T debates.

DA/Case: I’m not a huge fan of this kind of debate because it typically gets kind of boring. If you’re really good at this type of debate and you know there will be a lot of clash then go for it, just make sure you know what you’re doing.

Speaks: Speed is fine, if you aren’t clear I will let you know.
