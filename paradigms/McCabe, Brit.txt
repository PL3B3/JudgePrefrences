LD
I am pretty old school. Value, criteria and contentions which support your case.
I am not really interested in counterplans because the aff doesn't have to have one to begin with.
Honestly, if you are simply doing "one person policy debate," it is going to be tough to pick me up.
As for speaking........ A moderate rate of speed is fine. I will and do make a limited exception for 1AR.



PFD

This is the first year that I have really coached PFD.
