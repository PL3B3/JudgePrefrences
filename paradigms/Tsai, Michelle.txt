Key things/short version
Can flow some speed, but would be better if you "warmed up" your spreading. I'll yell slow when I can't follow but after 3 times I'll stop warning you.Read tags and author names slowerI am reluctant to intervene, so :Weigh on contention and framework level.Impact your extensions, tell me clearly how it affects the round.Make arguments as to which paradigms to prefer. I will vote however YOU say I should vote. If neither you, nor your opponent gives me any direction, I will default (listed later)However, I won't vote off of arguments that are unclearIf you have any unanswered questions, feel free to ask me before the round.Good luck, and have a good round :)Long version
FrameworkDefault to net benefits if both frameworks are deadDefault to comparative worlds unless arguments are made to justify truth testingDefault aff on presumptionSkep triggers must be unique to your framework (only your framework solves)Alternate frameworks (non v and vc) are fine, but it needs to explain how I should evaluate the roundI will vote off of framework spikes, but I will dock your speaks if these spikes are blippy or you overly rely on themTheoryThreshold for abuse is high, especially if you run blippy shellsDefault to reasonability without justifications, open to competing interps if warrantedDefault to drop the argRvi's and reverse rvi's fine. "I meet"'s are terminal defense.Explicitly weigh standardsk'sI am unfamiliar with critical literature (never ran any) so I am probably not the best person to read them in front of.If you must, then please: Make sure your warrants are clearBe explicit about how your K links, what did the aff do? What specific parts of the aff?How does your K solve? Randoms
Flex prep is fine if both debaters agree to itPrep doesn't start until flashing occursHave cites for cardsI won't disclose speaks
