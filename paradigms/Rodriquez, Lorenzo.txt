  School: Christopher Columbus High School 

I was a debater for Christopher Columbus for three years and competed mostly on the east coast. 
I judge the round based off the arguments that are made on the flow, so if something important happens in CX please bring it up in your speech because I may not be fully listening to the cx because as a college student sleep is a rare thing now so keep things interesting.

I am fine for the most part with speed but in most cases I will ask you to read a part of your other case to give you a straight answer, as a debater I was screwed by judges that said they were fine with speed but once I started I knew they were not going to keep up and it cost me a few rounds.

I am fine with theory as long as there is actual abuse. I cannot stand running theory just to run it.
DA and CP for the most part I am fine with I just ask that you slow down a bit on the key point like the plan text and the advantages. 
K’s I am not the strongest and will not lie to you don’t run them with me because I don’t want to cost you a round on something I don’t understand.

I determine speaker points off of how clear your speech is, so if you want to go fast PLEASE BE CLEAR, I hated it when my opponent was spreading and sounded like they had a potato in their mouths, if it means to slow down then slow down. 
Finally as a debater I ran almost every topic a functionality case so if you really want to impress me run function, that does not mean I will pick you up just because of it, now I know some topics you cant really run function so I understand that. 

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have before the round on anything else you may not be clear on.
