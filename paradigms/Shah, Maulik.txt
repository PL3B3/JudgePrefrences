  Background: I debated for Langham Creek High School and am now a student at The University of Texas at Austin. I competed in PF and LD, and am very familiar with both formats.

General Philosophy: I place a great importance on warrants and cards, especially if you bring up arguments within the round. I also do not like connecting the dots, and feel as if as debaters it is your job to guide me towards what you want me thinking. I like to be able to have a clean flow and not be thrown around all over my flow pad. I am pretty laid back and will accept all types of arguments. I don't mind you being funny or whatever else you want to do in the round. Just be yourself and have fun!

Speed: I personally am not too big of a fan of speed. It is up to you however to choose how fast you wish to speak. However, if I cannot hear it then it will not go onto my flow. If I can't flow it, then that puts you at a disadvantage in the round.

Theory: I do not have much experience with theory, but if you can do a good job relaying it to me in the round then I will accept it. I will accept any type of argument as long as you can warrant it and show me relevance.

Policy: Same as theory.

Speaker Points: I am usually extremely generous with speaker points. I look forward to judging great debates and want to see you guys have fun. As long as I can see that you guys were polite and respectful in the round, I will most likely give you great speaks. I do not like rude debaters who act like bullies in the round. Their speaker points will be reduced by a lot..

At the end of the day, have fun and be bold. Don't be intimidated by the other team, and please do not be intimidated by me of all people! 

Thank you, good luck, and HOOK EM'.
