  This pertains to LD.

1. Not a huge fan of plans or counterplans. I'll listen to them, but my standard for sufficiently negating a plan is really low.

2. Good observations and definition debate are appealing. In a large portion of the rounds I've judged, the winners have largely been decided off a definitions and observations. 

3. If both debater's have roughly equivalent values and value criteria (Morality and Utilitarianism, Justice and Human Rights) then unless there's some significant difference between the way each debater is defining the val/VC's, it is not worth putting more than five/ten seconds tops on the value/VC debate. If there's no real debate to be had there, that's fine, and neither debater will be penalized for that.
