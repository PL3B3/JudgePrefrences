  I debated two years of policy debate at Millard West High School. I'm currently a student at UNO.

I'm a pretty laid back judge and I'm okay with both old school policy and kirtik debate. I do prefer policy debates with aff's that have a plan text and the neg running CP's, DA's and so on, but I do evaluate kirtiks on the same level as any traditional policy arguments. The story of the Kritik should be clear at the end of the round and the alternative (if there is one) should be explained and extended throughout the round. 

I'm a T buff and so if any team is running T it should be ran correctly and argued intelligently. I hate horrible T debates and I won't vote on T just because I like it, it has to be well executed.

When it comes to speed, it's all good as long as I can understand what's being said.
