   
 Experience: I’m in my 3rd year of participating in Parliamentary debate, 2 years competing for Rancho Bernardo High School and currently competing for Palomar College. 
  
 Debate is a game wherein your job is to speak and my job is to listen. I can’t guarantee the former, but I’ll try my darndest regardless. Run any arguments you’d like. Theory should be used strategically and procedurals used when necessary. I really like debate about debate since I’m still deciding my own personal views on the activity, so please persuade me of the legitimacy of your argument, i.e. don’t speed through theory/procedurals but spend your time here to make them as impactful as possible. I try to be tabula rasa, however, if I’m not buying your argument, I will give it less weight in my final decision and if the offense is egregious I will wreck your speaks. 
 If you want to spread, go for it, but I won’t hesitate to call “clear” or “slower” and will continue to do so if I can’t keep up. 
 Modern moral degeneracy will never appeal to me, so keep that in mind when considering Fem K’s. 
  
 Don’t be stupid and we’ll have fun.
