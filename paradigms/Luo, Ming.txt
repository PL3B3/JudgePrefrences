  I debated three years for Randolph High School (NJ). To be honest, I'm pretty rusty. Consider me semi-lay.

If you're intending to speed read, watch my facial expressions to tell if I'm following you. I'll be able to reliably flow your arguments better with a bit of build up in speed. Don't burst out 300 wpm from the get-go or you'll lose me. 

I'm willing to vote on any type of argument so long as I understand it in the greater context of the round; i.e. you're going to have to be careful with critical and other dense arguments, err on the side of over-explanation rather than under.

At the end of your last speech, you should write the ballot for me. Reiterate why your offense better achieves the framework and why it outweighs your opponent's offense or why your opponent's offense is irrelevant. The crystallization should ideally be a 'story' of the round, telling me what arguments were made but why yours are superior. I won't buy new weighing in the last speech.

If your opponent is obviously less experienced than you are, make an attempt to help, rather than exclude them. You donâ€™t need to read topicality on novices, etc.

Speaker points are scaled according to the tournament. If you have any questions, feel free to ask before the round.
