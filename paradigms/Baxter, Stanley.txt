  I previously debated L-D in High School (Seton Hall Prep) for 3 years.

During my time I have seen many techniques and performance styles.

As a judge I heavily weigh the framework of cases and look for debaters to provide logical pathology to conclusions. Unorthodox positions are fine as well as spreading.
I flow case, arguments and any cross-ex dialog. All debaters should bring timers and ask any questions for me before beginning the round.
