   I debated LD in high school as well as PF, and multiple Interp events and have done judging since in LD . 
 
 Spreading detracts from values clash and makes for boring rounds. Good signposting causes the round to be clean and will let the debate to come down to the arguments. Please signpost. I fallow the flow to see who won, so again please signpost to help me know that I have it right. You can try it but once someone starts mumbling it becomes a specking issue. I believe that smooth specking style is less important than case but is necessary for proper debate. 
  I prefer conversational speaking for speed. Overloading your opponent with as many contentions as you can shows me that your case is too disconnected from the resolution. I enjoy a strong value criteria debate. Contentions should support the link between your value criterion and the resolution. I vote first on the value criteria debate and second on the contention debate. I love strong philosophical debates. LD is not policy or public forum. While the use of evidence is helpful, theoretical philosophical analysis is the best. 
  I also enjoy when there is spirited debate over just robotic recitation. This is debate about values so show that you believe in your case.
