  I judge district circuit tournaments in the Las Vegas area and am vaguely familiar with the topic. I have been judging for three years now and have no debate experience myself.

As far as arguments go, I just want to know the facts and I want you to persuade me. As a debater your job is to use your evidence as an arsenal of sorts. I really appreciate evidence comparison and qualifications debate when necessary. Not only will our arguments become more persuasive, but your speaker points will also go up.
Impacted debates are the best ones, but donâ€™t forget about the link story. I love to hear the big picture of debate as much as I like the line by line, however, remember to engage me.

I am new at this game, so spell out for me why you win and avoid buzz words when possible.
