  I am the Head Debate coach at Shanley High School in Fargo, ND. I have judged debate on and off for the past decade and was a LD competitor in High School winning a State Championship my senior year. I have coached All-Americans, multiple National Qualifiers and a middle school Quarterfinalist at the Middle School National Tournament last summer.

LD: I am a bit old school and appreciate a hearty debate that links clearly and directly to the V/C. I like to see heavy clash, and analysis of contentions as they directly relate to the resolution. I do not mind out of the box arguments but they must have a strong link to the V/C and ultimately uphold the resolution. I believe LD should focus on the "should" not merely our current real world. I have no issue with speed but it needs to be clear and audible. I do think less is more, and a few strong, powerful arguments are better than a myriad of cards that are never linked back to the overall resolution and in the end are usually dropped by both sides. I keep a rigorous flow but will not do the work for you. If arguments are dropped or not answered appropriately it is your job to pull them across to your side. I can follow a multitude of frameworks just make sure your roadmap is logical and not cherry picking arguments you assume I will cross apply across the flow for you.

PF: I appreciate out of the box arguments in PF. As above, I like to see heavy clash and not merely a reiteration of your arguments. With time constraints I stress less is more. Make good quality arguments that carry weight---sometimes 2 is better than 10.

Overall, I like clear, insightful and respectful debates.
