  I am a fourth year LD judge. Here are a few things you should know about me as a judge:

Speed: I don’t have much experience with spreading. That said, I’m fine if you speak at a faster-than-conversational pace, as long as you’re intelligible. I’ll yell “clear” if I can’t understand.

Theory: Theory arguments are okay with me as long as they are exceptionally clear and do not attempt to re-frame the resolution into something it’s not. Only run theory if you genuinely feel it is fair for both sides and will truly enhance the debate.

K’s/CPs/DA’s/Etc.: While I recognize and respect the legitimacy of non-traditional frameworks/cases, I prefer a traditional value/criterion structure. I am a firm believer in debating the topic for what it is, as written.

Cross-Examination: Cross-examination is especially important to me. Limit clarifying questions to what you absolutely need. Know the points you want to establish, and if your opponent isn’t admitting what you want them to, move on. It’s extremely effective when you incorporate concessions you got in cross-x into your rebuttals.

Miscellaneous: Extending a card will not automatically win you my ballot. I believe the purpose of evidence is to support your own logic and argumentation, so that’s where the emphasis should be. I am a trial attorney, so presentation is especially important to me. While presentational skills alone will not win you the round, they will enhance your arguments.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask me before the round.
