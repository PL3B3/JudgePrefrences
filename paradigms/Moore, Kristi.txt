  I am an IE coach from Jefferson City High School. I have never done policy debate, but I do have a lot of experience in public speaking. 

Here's my preferences for debate rounds: 
1) Please do not spread. I coach public speaking, so I think that speeding is detestable. If speeding is incorporated into the round, I will vote for the slower team or randomly sign my ballot.
2) Kritiks might be fine if you explain them well. I don't read K literature, so if you don't explain you argument, I won't understand you.
3) As an English teacher, I find (good) T debates enjoyable.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask me in round. Overall, I am a very traditional judge.
