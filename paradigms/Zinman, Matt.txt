  Hi, my name is Matt! I debated for Harrison High School in NY for 4 years and qualified to TOC my senior year. I worked at Global Debate Symposium (GDS) this past summer and do parliamentary debate in college.

I’d like to hear a substantive round. However, if you are absolutely horrible at debating the topic or do not have any topical prep, I wouldn’t change your debating style to fit my preferences. I’d rather see you run an argument well (even if it’s not my favorite type of argument) than debate the topic poorly.

If you read an argument that I think is blatantly false or ridiculous then I will have a very low threshold for responses from your opponent.

I am fine with spreading but have not listened to anyone spread for a while. Please be super clear and start with a speed that is a little slower than your fastest pace.

SLOW DOWN WHEN READING THEORY INTERPS AND ADVOCACY TEXTS

WEIGH AND TELL ME WHERE I SHOULD VOTE! The last minute to 30 seconds of your last speech should be what you want me to write as my RFD.

Have fun and don’t be mean to your opponent.
