  Lincoln-Douglas Debater at Aberdeen Central High School, 2010-2014

I was in debate all through high school, attended NFL nationals twice in LD, and was the state champion in SD once. I am now a student at the University of Minnesota.

I did do policy, but only for freshman year, so I understand DAs, T, and case arguments, but that is all I learned.

With all types of debate, I will vote for whoever presents the strongest arguments. I will usually look at the flow to determine who wins the round, but if there is one clear argument that stands out, I will vote on that. I don't like much speed, and arguments should be extended as much as possible.

In LD, there should be a value, criterion, and contentions, and they should link together. LD should involve moral concepts, and the main voters should include value and criterion.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have before the round!
