  I have been judging debate for about 2 years.
Prior Judge Experience: PFD, Drama, Individual Speech, Special Occasion Speaking, Novice LD.

Judge Philisophy: 

1. put aside personal prejudices on the topic.
2. the best argument wins.
3. the debater needs to convince me. 
4. in real world, which way would I go based on what I just heard?
