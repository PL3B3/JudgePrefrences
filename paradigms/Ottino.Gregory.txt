  I'll try to be as organized as possible:

Speed: Don't spread me. Your prepared speeches should come off at about the same speed as rebuttal, so feel free to use that as a reference point. I will drop my pen if you are going to quickly.

Value (criterion or standard): this is a value debate so make it about the value. Tie everything back into your value. Ensure clash for me. I will vote more towards who succeeds in the clash. Carry all your arguments through.

Theory. Theory has a very specific purpose of combating abuse. It should not be used offensively. It should not be the crux of a case unless the abuse is serious enough to merit it. Do not use theory at the expense of on case or to the point that you must speak too quickly and you loose me. Use sparingly.

Contentions: Link all of them back into your value, make them clash with your opponents value and contentions.

If you have any other questions please ask me in round, otherwise remember that i lean traditional rather than progressive and to focus on value clash.
