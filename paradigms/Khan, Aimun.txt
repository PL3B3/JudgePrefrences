Background:
 
CONFLICTS: Plano West, Montgomery

I did LD for four years in Dallas, qualifying to the TOC my senior year. If you need something before/after (pls not during) the round, I’m most active on Facebook.
5 min before the round:
 If you leave a lot of embedded clash for me to resolve, don't post-round me.Tell me what arguments to (literally) highlight on my flow.I'm not great at flowing so don't make my job even harder. Tell me where to flow things.Speaks come from collapsing, lots of weighing, crystallizing, and writing the ballot for me.If you say "Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru" when extending a conceded argument I may boost your speaks depending on your pronunciation.ASSUME I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR AUTHOR SAYS ESP WITH K's AND PHIL.I probably haven't read the topic lit.Tech > truthI don’t give half a shit about rep and I couldn’t care less who coaches you.
Speed/reading:
 Signposting and popping your tags (delineating where a card ends with a pause or *and*) makes you sooo much easier to flow. When I don't know where to flow what you're saying is when my flow (and decision) gets messy.Speed and clarity are two separate things. As long as you’re clear, speed shouldn’t be a problem. I'll be hesitant to say clear more than once.Please slow down for tags, texts, and interps.I’m not a flowbot so don’t treat me like one.
Critical:
 While I have a basic understanding of most K's, I probably don't know the argument in the nuance you'd like me to. Your 2NR needs to be easy to follow.I HATE prewritten buzzwordy 2NR overviews and extensions—you should be able to clearly explain what your K says without the jargon.I want you to pretend I'm a novice and explain how to evaluate the K and why it's responsive to the aff very clearly.Your coach's policy backfiles don't impress me.You need to do a good job of sequencing issues for me/telling me what args to look at first and why. Don't just tell me what's important, tell me WHY it's important in the context of the aff.Please please please spend at least 30 seconds being big picture and telling me what you want me to write on the ballot.Dense 1NCs that are just a bunch of cards with no analysis and vague cross-apps to the aff are very hard to follow. Reading the K does not mean you no longer have to do explicit clash.If I don’t know what the world of the alt looks like by the end of the 2NR I’ll be sad.
Larp:
 Don't make your extensions just re-reading tags, you gotta explain warrants in the 1AR and 2AR.Explicit warrant-to-warrant comparison is a must for the evidence debate.I really don’t like calling for cards, as it forces intervention one way or another since it’s up to me to interpret the evidence. I would rather you do the work to tell me what to do with something rather than just tell me to call for it.
Theory:
 I said it already but slow down for interps. If you can type them before the speech that would be ideal.If you blitz through blips I’m not going to be able to write everything down, so I’d recommend slowing down on important things you want me to catch.Numbering/labeling makes you easier to flow.Buzzwords are not arguments. Make arguments.Tell me where to flow long pre-written dumps.
Phil/framework-heavy:
 Vaguely familiar w most common phil authors but please assume I don't know anything about your arg. Just don't use too much jargon and I'm good.The places I get lose on these flows are where they get very jargon-heavy.The more explanation you can do without that the better. Explain it like I'm a novice.Please make sure I understand the framework. If you have to take 10 seconds at the top of the 2AR (or even the 1AC) to summarize, that’s much better than me being lost the entire round. Examples help a ton.Explain what the implication of winning an issue is. Spell things out for me.Slow down after standard texts and give me a second to catch up to you.
“Tricks”:
 If you’re a tricks debater I would avoid preffing me. I’m not the right judge for blipstorms or messy theory debate.If you still choose to pref me, numbering things, layering, and spending time cleaning up the debate in the rebuttals would be appreciated. Be an honest warrior and be transparent about your arguments. I’ll do my best to evaluate what you give me, it’s just not what I’m used to and I tend to get lost.If something magically becomes a presumption trigger in the next speech I will be hesitant to vote on it.Take some time in your last speech to be big picture and spell out the ballot story for me.I'll do my best to indicate when I'm lost with facial expressions.
Most importantly, this is your activity so have fun with it!
