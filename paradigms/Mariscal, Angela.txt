   I have been judging for two years now and have judged locally in my daughter's league and in several invitationals. I believe that Lincoln-Douglas is about speaking clearly and persuasively to the topic. Spreading is neither clear nor persuasive in this event. I am listening to how you support your contentions and how you attack your opponent's contentions, but I really don't like to hear you debate the "rules" of LD. Almost always I give the ballot to the speaker who upheld his or her value and showed that his or her impact outweighed the impact of the opponent.
