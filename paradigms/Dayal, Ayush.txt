  Dayal, Ayush - Judging Philosophy

Some pointers for debating in front of me:

-I debated for 5 years at Westminster and currently attend the University of Southern California.

-I love debate and I like great arguments: support arguments with warrants and present yourself in a way that will win you the ballot.

-Don't spit out K Jargon - if you do, know that you are performing and you should sound good. Always explain your K at least once all the way through (aka the story).

Finally, I do believe that everything is negotiable so feel free to debate the rules of the game.

And, remember to only ask meaningful questions. If you can ask your peer or google it yourself, keep it to yourself and find the answer. Meaningful questions and practical application of the feedback will help you get better in debate and overall presentation-giving.

Good Luck!
