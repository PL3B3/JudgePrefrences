  I work in a Policy Maker paradigm, wherein I put myself in the position of a decision maker regarding the merits of the affirmative plan. Therefore, stock issue are critical to the round. Topicality is most certainly a voter; however, I will vote on theory depending on how itâ€™s argued within the round. Disads and Counterplans are advised, though steering clear of Plan Inclusive Counterplans would be wise. Kritiks are acceptable, but keep in mind that my default paradigm (unless you direct me otherwise) is a policy making paradigm. Finally, excessive speed should be avoided as I feel that the purpose of debate is not about throwing out a myriad of arguments in quick succession but about communicating and persuading based on facts and credible sources.
