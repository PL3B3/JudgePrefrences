  I am a LD coach in the CFL. This is my 3rd year coaching Lincoln-Douglass debate. It is my 4th year teaching (mostly civics & economics). 

Here is what I look for as a judge: 

Value & Criterion - remember this is LD, not PF. Ultimately I am looking for you to tie all points in your case back to your value structure. Your value structure sets a standard for me to weigh the round. Be sure that your case upholds the standard established in your value structure. 

Clarity, Logic, & IMPACT - Keep your arguments concise and to the point. Snowball effects and illogical conclusions will cause me to discount your arguments. I want to see impact!! Why is what you are arguing important? Why should I care? Evidence should be clear and concise, cited and applied correctly to your case.

QUALITY > Quantity - Speed does not win a round with me. Logical, original, well-thought out arguments will win your round. I will flow as you debate, and if I cannot understand you I can not flow your arguments. If you spew out as many arguments as you can or barrel through reading your case, I will likely just drop my pen.A good debater can give clear, logical arguments in the time frame allotted without needing to speed read. Again, QUALITY is better than quantity. 

Maturity & Civility - I will take points for arrogance, rudeness, or immaturity. There is never cause to be nasty or unkind to your opponent. If you cannot argue your side diplomatically and respectfully, your lack of professionalism will be reflected in speaker points.
