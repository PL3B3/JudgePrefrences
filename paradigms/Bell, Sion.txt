Affiliation: Capitol Debate

I debated for four years in high school under Atholton and debated a variety of arguments while achieving national success. Like everyone else, I have some fav args and some that maybe you shouldn't say in front of me. If anything here is missing, I agree with everything Daryl Burch has ever done/said about debate.

Some quick things:
Speed is fine, obv slow down for tags/theory/analyticsI'm all in for a theory debateCheap shots are A-OK (if they're funny, even better)Use CX, it's my favorite part of the debateKs are sweetNo plan affs are sweetT is also sweetFollow Wheaton's law"There needs to be an arrogance to excellence ratio" - Will Katz"A little swag goes a long way" - Henry J Walter
I was largely known as a "performance debater" for my last year of high school and will probably be known as one for the next few years as well. That being said, I'll try to be objective. Do what you gotta do. If that's FW, cool. If that's several DAs, a K, and case, awesome. Just be sensitive when you're dealing with an argument that is personal.

Things in which I am up in the lit that aren't standard policy args:
AfropessimismAfrooptimismBaudrillardTrans theoryLiberal feminismRadical feminism (don't do this)Critical race theoryQueer theoryDerridaMarx/cap litAnything else, don't assume that I understand what you mean when you string together 20 buzzwords.

Speaker points are arbitrary, so here's my scale (use your imagination to fill in the gaps):1 : You didn't follow Wheaton's law to an inordinant amount/were otherwise racist/sexist/transphobic/etc27 : You're probably just getting in to debate. I'll give you lots of comments after my RFD.28 : Decent, you said some smart things but you gotta ways29 : Pretty damn swell30 : Fanfuckingtastic
The scale will be adjusted depending on the level of competition

I realized that the above probably isn't much help for those of you who are in your first/second year of debate, so here's an addendum: Read what you can, and try to explain your arguments as best as you can. Remember that arguments consist of both a claim and a warrant, and it will be very difficult for me to vote for you if you don't explain your warrants. If you don't extend arguments through to the last rebuttals, I can't vote on them. Debate is mainly about perception, so stand straight (if you can), be confident, and don't give up no matter what. Use all your prep time, flow what the other team is saying, put offense first, and be respectful.
