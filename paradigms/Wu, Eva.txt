  I'm more of a traditional LD debater, as in V/VC structure and whoever upholds their V/VC better wins the round. That being said, I am fairly flexible and appreciate creativity and change. However if you are spewing BS (i.e. running theory for the purpose of running theory), just don't say it. 

I'm fine with speed but please don't go so fast that you start foaming at the mouth and words start jumbling together.
Only spread if you are good at spreading, nobody appreciates a bad spreader.
Only spread if it is necessary, otherwise you will see deductions in speaks. 
remember... clarity is more important than speed 

I'm fairly open to theory, but only if there's a clear violation.

As for Kritiks, disads, and other strange cases, if there's logic to what you are saying I will listen.

I don't listen during CX. If you made a great argument I won't flow it until you bring it up in your rebuttal..

Please extend properly. 

I won't vote off of new arguments in 2AR because it's completely unfair to neg since they can't possibly respond to those arguments.

I will try to not interfere, but if both sides are not clashing or doing their job, I will be forced to weigh and make arguments for you.

Oh, and remember rude people do not win debates.
