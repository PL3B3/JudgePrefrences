About me: I competed in Student Congress and entered some tournaments in high school and I am now a freshman at Seminole State College. Overall I am new to debate and I am waiting to join the UF debate team.

My Philosophy:
1) If you’re going to argue Topicality, don’t just say a paragraph and move on. I will judge on topicality if it is well presented but will dismiss the argument if it is not thought out.

2) I see dropped arguments like a hawk and I weigh heavily on the importance of the dropped argument. It is ok to drop an argument that has no value in the debate, but I prefer to see clash.

3) DA’s are good, but if you’re going to give 10 to 15 of them, I will not expect the aff to argue each one. I prefer to have about four DA’s so there will be more clash.

4) In Student Congress we did not use Kritiks, but I generally think they are useless and they don’t argue the content of the resolution.

5) I just like a moderate speaking rate, if you speak to fast I will say slow down and if I say it 3 times I will deduct speaker points. Practice vocal variety.

6) Have fun. If you don’t break or get a trophy don’t stress it because there are more tournaments.
