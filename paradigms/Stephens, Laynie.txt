  Debated 4 years for St. Vincent High School, now attending Stanford University and have debated for both the policy and parli team this year. 

Overall: The debate is about you not me, so run the arguments you're best at and most comfortable with. Just because I was primarily a K/performance debater in high school is not a reason for you to read your kritik in front of me if it's not your best strategy. Read your K if it's what you do best, but if you're better with straight-up policy arguments, please run those instead! Run what you're best at, and tell me how to evaluate the round.

The Stanford 2013 tournament is my first tournament judging on this topic, so explain your arguments and don't assume I know your acronyms. Assume I know nothing on the topic and explain to me why you win! I also haven't debated policy since September, so keep that in mind. Speed is totally fine as long as you're clear. 

If you have any questions about specific arguments you can ask me before the round, but assume that any argument in front of me is fine, as long as you explain it.
