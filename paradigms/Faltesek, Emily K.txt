  I debated for Concordia from 2002-2005. I mostly ran Kritiks but am happy to hear well reasoned arguments of many flavors. I tend to think that debaters should be open to and respectful of a wide variety of approaches to debate and am not easily persuaded that a particular type of argument should not be allowed. In all debates I prefer specific link analysis. I am unlikely to vote on cheap shots, I am willing to vote aff on CP theory. I do not judge debates regularly and so you would be well served by slowing down just a little and explaining things as you would to someone unfamiliar with the topic. I did not ever do completely computer-based debate and so I am not sure what the conventions are for tech failures in round/ evidence sharing/ etc.
