  I’m basically a Tab judge. Feel free to run your favorite arguments. If you think you can win on it, run it. DA: make sure and make links clear, give me impact calculus. CP: make sure it’s competitive and give me good solvency. Ks: make sure to do good link work, and spend time on explaining the alt. I can’t stress that enough. Spending a little extra time on explaining the K will go a long way in helping me evaluate it. Explain why it outweighs the case, how it’s the root cause, or what are the impacts, etc. Make sure there are some case arguments, at least some impact defense.
T gets it’s own time. I dislike T. My philosophy on T is that when I vote on T, I’m literally saying the Aff is untopical and no one should be running it under this topic.
