  To begin, this will be my first tournament formally judged and I am a social studies teacher at Judge Memorial High School. I will be looking for well constructed arguments made clearly and persuasively. I do not prefer progressive debate for I feel it takes away from the debate as a whole. As far as cross examination goes, I will listen carefully but will expect any information needing to be used to be brought up in your next speech. I am not experienced in the debate field but have frequent debates in my classroom and have a taken great interest in the community as a whole. I am excited to see each and every argument made and will give every round to the best debater overall. Thank you and I look forward to judging you.
