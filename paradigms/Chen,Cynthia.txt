  I debated on the national circuit for three years while I was in high school, and graduated in 2006. I attended Lynbrook High School in California.

I am open to all types of argumentation, though I don't judge frequently and was not overly familiar with theory while I debated so if that comes up in the round it is up to you to be very, very clear about what is going on and what I as the judge should be doing with it.

Speed is fine, I flow fairly quickly, but please don't go fast just for the sake of going fast.

Clarity is really important to me as a judge. That means clear claims, warrants, impacts when an argument is presented, clear signposting in rebuttals, and crystallizing well as you explain to me how I should vote in your last speech. Weighing is good, and helps me make my decision. Ideally, in your last speeches you should be writing the ballot for me.

I don't think there's anything particularly unique about how I assign speaker points. I do deduct additional points for being impolite to your opponent.
