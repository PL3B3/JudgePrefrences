  I was a circuit LD debater in high school and judged nationally while in college. I am definitely a flow judge, and will vote off of my flow. I get asked all the time, so I'll just say that yes, I can handle all of your speed. 

As for my paradigm: When you're debating in front of me, you can basically do anything you want argument-wise - off-cases, kritiks, Aff plans, whatever - I don't really have any preferences so long as you're good. That said, I'll mention these two caveats:

1.) I would like to have some sort of evaluative mechanism I can use to decide who won at the end of the round. It doesn't have to be a traditional value structure (ot it can be); I just need some way to weigh arguments and a way of knowing what arguments impact the correct standard if you will.
2.) I don't particularly like squirrely arguments that try to co-opt your opponent's ground for example, or otherwise unreasonably restrict the debate. That's not to say I don't enjoy a good theory debate (in fact I enjoy that very much). What I'm talking about is a blip definition or observation you just want your opponent to drop so you can basically say you win. Now, I am a flow judge, so I'm not saying if that happens and you use it correctly I won't vote on it, but I just won't be happy.

Finally, this isn't a paradigm thing per se, but let me just say as a good debating tip (and definitely something that's good to do in front of me): judges are lazy. Nothing makes me happier than when a debater writes my ballot for me (figuratively). If you don't, I'm gonna go looking for a reason to vote, and while I think I make good decisions, you might not like it, so avoid that and write my ballot for me. Also, let me just say that there isn't any reason why debaters can't treat each other and the judge (me) with respect before, during, and after the round, so please do so.

Other than that, have at it, and have fun.
