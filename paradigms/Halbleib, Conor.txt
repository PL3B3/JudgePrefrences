While judging policy debates it is important to separate this type of debate from others including Lincoln Douglas and Public Forum. I would much rather see one good system or solution to the problem brought up rather than multiple solution options. Not that I don't think that they could work, but I think it is difficult for high schoolers to adequately defend multiple positions in this type of debate. I rather enjoy a debater who can be aggressive in attacking his/her opponent's case without crossing the line into crude or brash. Most teams either are too soft or are simply rude to the opposition. A balance between the two is preferential. I am totally fine with speed. I think when used correctly it can be an effective tool against an opponent. That being said, if I can't understand what is being said and the cards aren't clear, that is where the problem lies. Finally assume I know nothing. I try not to walk in with a decision based on the topic. As long as your information is FACTUAL, and your opponent does not successfully refute the evidence, I am inclined to believe whatever it is you say. My flow is recorded in a time sensitive manner. When you wish to counter an opponent's claim, it is best to do it ASAP, or it may become lost later on or seen as being a poor defensive tactic.
