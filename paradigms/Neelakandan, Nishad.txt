McDonogh School '17

I go by Nish and I currently am a senior at McDonogh School. Because it is customary to list your stats: When I graduate I will have qualified to the TOC 3 years in a row, won 3+ tournaments, and been top speaker at a handful.

Pref me: I like debate and I like judging. I do it for fun and will utilize all my energy to give you the respect you deserve for hours of work.

I'm a pretty laid back judge; I'll listen to anything. That being said, the affs I read my senior year were called "I Sing to China", "DuBoisian Aesthetics", "The Death of Respectability", and "TPP". My 2NRs were almost all Wilderson, Lacan, or some sort of race argument. I understand how traditional debate works and can judge those rounds but my expertise remains in kritikal literature. I'm great with race args and high theory args so feel free to throw around whatever the hell you want, I'll understand. Daryl Burch was my high school coach and I've learned hella from him so reading his paradigm wont hurt. My assumption is I'm going to judge 50% kritikal debates and 50% clash debates where the only reason I was preffed was cause I'm friends with the policy team. 

Performance Affs: I read exclusively performance affs in HS, even when I read a plan text it was performative. Things to keep in mind:
1. the aff must be in the direction of the topic. I don't know what that means, so tell me what that means.
2. make it meaningful

Kritiks: 
- this is your best bet. I've done hella funky shit with kritiks so do whatever the hell you want. I've gone for Wilderson as a non-unique linear DA before, and other times I've read an alternative and defended it.
- The K has to be a reason why the aff is bad, not the squo

- You don't need an alt. 
- Do lots of framing. If you say shit like one percent risk framing you gon be in a good position. 
- I like overviews too, creative link stories make me happy, so go wild. I've given 6 minute overviews before so try and top that. 

Framework: pretty much every aff debate I've had has been a framework debate, so I feel like I know a lot about how these debates go down. That being said, I've also gone for framework-y arguments concerning black materiality and like if you win the debate you win the debate so you do you and read what you want.
- F/W is about competing models for debate, so when I'm writing my RFD my entire decision is hinged upon "what are the disads to this model of debate and do the net benefits to your model outweigh it"
- People have made this move to go for procedural fairness less and less (which I like). Go for substantive shit. Framework teams that argue will do far better in front of me than framework teams that complain
- Debate is changing. I once heard Sheryl Kazcmarek start out an RFD with "2008 called, they want their framework arguments back". Don't make me have to repeat that in a debate.
- T-USFG is not a framework argument, it's A-Spec on steroids.


Extra Stuff:
- DON'T USE POCKETBOX AND DON'T PLEAD WITH ME TO LET YOU USE POCKETBOX. POCKETBOX IS FOR N00BS.
- Speak with purpose and I'll give you beautiful speaks. I'll almost never give below a 27, and most speaks are averaged between 28.5-29.5
- Throw me on the email chain: ngneelakandan@mcdonogh.org
- If you want to contact me after a debate my number is 4109170614
- Don't be a fucking chump and stand up for yourself. I like people who are willing to trudge through a storm.
- TKO or "ethics challenge" means the debate ends right there, winning team gets 29.5's and losing team gets 26's
- If you have preferences or things like pronouns you want me to use tell me
- Debates where nobody has any idea what the fuck is going on make me smile lol

I like petty debates. I like lots of competitive energy and heated debates. Terrorize the hell out of your opponent (in a way that is still cognizant towards where people coming from) if you please... that was my A strat. I was in Michigan KM's lab this summer and my eyes have been opened to the endless ways to have fun in debate. Have fun with it, make me laugh, and we'll all celebrate with some good speaks.
