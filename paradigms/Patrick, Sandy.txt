  I'm generally a policy-maker so I will listen to kritikal arguments but there needs to be a real alternative you are willing to defend. I would say I'm moderate in terms of speed. Theory is fine, but if you want to get too deep (and often too fast) into fine points of theory you risk losing me...I've coached high school debate for a long-time (emphasis on long) and debated NDT in college before that. I'm fine with Topicality. If there's anything more specific you want to know, just ask...
