  I am the coach at Victoria East High School in Victoria Texas. I have coached for about 30 years off and on and am fairly experienced. I tend to be fairly traditional but will judge on what you give me. I can handle seep if you clear and I like tight links and respond to well to solid warrants and clear impacts. I have no problem with theoretical arguments if you can apply them to your opponent. Good luck.
