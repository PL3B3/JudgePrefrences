  I debated LD for three years in High School and am an Assistant Coach for the Murray High School Debate team and have been for the past two years.
I have competed in and judged for all forms of debate so I am familiar with how rounds should be judged for each respective event. 
I enjoy hearing pre-fiat or K based arguments, mainly because I find philosophy fascinating. I am minoring in philosophy, so please don't try to run someone you don't understand, because I will not make ground for you. 
I try to be as Tabular Rosa as possible (I don't think full tabular rosa exists), but I tend not to buy arguments in the realm of Rape good, no racism, etc. Everyone deserves a voice in my opinion. I don't really like to hear Topicality arguments, but if I'm forced to I will vote there. 
Be clear as to what matters in the round and justify it, as the judge I will determine if you meet the burden you set for the round as well as your opponent, based on what I flow.
I'm fine with speed, but for the love of god please be clear, I hate making debaters feel slighted because they were going faster than their clarity level and hence did not get their arguments on my flow.
If you have any specific questions for me feel free to ask.

P.S. I won't hate you if you try and shake my hand.
