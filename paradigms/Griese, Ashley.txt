  I have been involved in debate since 2001 at Watertown High School in Watertown, SD. I did not really debate in college but have coached ever since high school at various capacities. I am currently the Director of Debate at Lincoln High School, Sioux Falls SD, where I have been for the past two years.

I hate to say that I am old school, but to say otherwise would be a lie. I do not really enjoy the nuances that come with debating on laptops. I flow on paper and I evaluate the round based on the arguments I hear. In other words, speaking skills do matter. Furthermore, you would do better with me to clearly extend warrants than just authors. I find another assumption debaters make is that by giving me the author I automatically know the warrant.

 I really do not mind any position that is debated well (warrants, impact calc, etc.) I also will vote on frameworks other than util if given a reason; however, that is how I default. I also default policy maker if not given an alternative paradigm. I do not mind critical arguments, but I did not run them as a debater so my depth of knowledge is not excellent. The role of the ballot is important from the beginning of the debate to the last speeches. I would say that I am strategy oriented on the negative; I like to see that the 1NC had a plan- the arguments were intentional and belonged. I dislike conditionality good. To win theory there ought to be in-round abuse. 


If you have any other questions just ask!
