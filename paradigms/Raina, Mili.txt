  Emory University - Class of 2018
Alpharetta High School - Class of 2014

I am a freshman at Emory University and I debated for 4 years at Alpharetta High School in the suburbs of Atlanta.

I love debate and the people in it. Here's a quick rundown of things you should know about me in order to persuade me -

1. BE NICE. Screaming, slimy comments, and eye rolling is not condoned. It isn't ethos - it reveals insecurity. Sexist, racist, and homophobic comments will result in very low speaker points and probably a loss. 

2. EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU HAVE WON THE ROUND. Tech>truth. If you don't tell me to read a piece of evidence by inditing their evidence or explaining why your evidence is better, I won't be inclined to read it.

3. DEFEND A TOPICAL PLAN. I know the community is moving toward being ok with plan-less debates, but I'm not.

4. BE CLEAR.

5. DON'T CLIP.

6. PREP TIME ENDS WHEN THE FLASH DRIVE LEAVES YOUR COMPUTER.

More:

General Impact Calc - 
- "No risk" of a DA does exist. 

Topicality - 
- Default to reasonability if the aff isn't blatantly untopical. 

Conditionality - 
- Conditionality is bad, but no one has ever said "I really want to judge a round where the 2A gets up and cries about how much their time was skewed in this round". If you go for conditionality, go for it like a real argument. It shouldn't be obvious that it is your absolute last attempt at a win (which it usually is.)
- Don't say "condo" or "strat skew". Say "conditionality" and "strategy skew". 

Post Modern Critiques - 
- I haven't spend time reading much post modern philosophy and don't intend to anytime soon, so, when going for a critique like Baudrillard, you will need to spend a little more time explaining links. I do not enjoy these debates and honestly don't feel qualified to judge them, so please don't put me in that position. BUT, if such a critique is your best strategy you should obviously go for it. 

PICs - 
- Default neg. 

Actor CPs - 
- Default neg.

Process CPs, Conditions CPs, Agent CPs, Consult CPs-
- Affs need to call abusive negatives out on cheating cps but they rarely do. 
- Default aff.
