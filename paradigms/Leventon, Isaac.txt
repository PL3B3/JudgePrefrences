  Judging Philosophy: Stock Issues judge with a focus on utilitarian balancing. Stock Issues include, but are not limited to, topicality and inherency. I tend to favor stock issues arguements over critiques or moral imperatives. The more on-case debate the better; the more clash the better. Speed is not a problem as long it is clear. I prefer closed CX so that each team member can have a chance to ask/answer questions about his/her arguements.

Background: Bellaire High School, four years CX debate including three years TFA state. One year placed at NFL nationals.
Judging experience:  20-30 rounds over five years. No rounds judged this year (2009). 
Judging affiliations: Bellaire High School (previous years) and Alpharetta High School (this year, 2009)
