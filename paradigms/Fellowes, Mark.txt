  Speed: I don't appreciate the attempt to jam in a large number of pooly articulated arguments. Clarity and quality of argument and evidence is more important than quantity of arguments. Get me to care why your argument and supporting evidence is superior to your opponent's.

The winning debator will do the following better than his/her opponent:
- speak with clarity and a sense of purpose
- develop arguments thoroughly, using appropriate signposts along the way
- rebut opponent's arguments effectively
- use theory, kritik or topicality when appropriate, but not in a forced manner
- treat your opponent and judge with respect at all times
- avoid absurdity with your evidence or rebuttals.
- answer the questions posed during cx rather than avoiding them
