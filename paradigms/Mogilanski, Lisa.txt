  I debated Lincoln-Douglas for four years at Hunter College High School in New York City. I'm currently a member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society.

I ran mostly traditional cases, but you can use whatever kind of structure you like as long as you give me some clear mechanism with which to evaluate arguments. I tend to think that stock arguments are stock for a reason (and that positions that seem intuitively absurd probably are), but as long as you warrant your arguments and explain yourself, I'll be happy to listen. I can flow speed but I've never really enjoyed it.
I'm not usually receptive to theory....but if you think your opponent is really being abusive, explain why (in a shell or otherwise).

And if you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
