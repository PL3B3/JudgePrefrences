I am generally interested in any debate, but I'm expecting a lot of clash, a lot of interaction between both sides. The team that frames the debate most effectively will win my ballot. This includes (especially for K teams) telling me how to evaluate the impacts of policy versus ideology. If you are on the negative prepare your 2NR for developing one or two arguments in those last five minutes. It is so easy to overwhelm your opponent with information, yet talented debaters are good at weighing the other side's argument against their own position. Tell me how to put things in perspective as the judge and you will afford a victory.

Philosophy is one of my strong passions so please feel free to run anything obscure or creative around me. When I debated in high school, I wrote a lot of K's and did performances affs while competing in the National Circuit. I also have a traditional background in terms of my style of debate: I used to cut politics stuff and counterplans too. If the neg runs a counterplan, the aff definitely should explain to me how the CP is not competitive or that there is no net benefit. All this just to say that I am a very mutable judge, I transition very smoothly between various frameworks of the debate. Just chose one to develop thoroughly when it comes around to the rebuttals.
