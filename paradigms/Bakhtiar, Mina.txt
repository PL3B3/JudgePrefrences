  I'm a policy judge and I vote under a competing worlds paradigm. 

Counterplans/Disads/On Case is all great.

When I say that I'm a policy judge I mean that I prefer policy arguments because a poorly run policy argument is not as painful as poorly run theory or K debate. I still really enjoy hearing Ks/critical affs, and am more than happy to vote on one. Just please don't run a K if you don't understand it. Please remember to weigh at the end of the round!

Theory's fine too, just slow down and give me a few seconds of analytic arguments after you speed a 3 second shell if you think framework is actually really important in the round, and if you want me to vote on it. Theory isn't my favorite thing to vote on unless it's really explicit. These debates can get messy, which is annoying, and I can't weigh for you. 


I'm fine with speed, but slow down for tags and authors and please signpost! I dock speaks if you have issues with volume or clarity.
