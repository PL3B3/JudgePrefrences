  Currently attend the University of California-Los Angeles. I debated through all high school on both local and national circuits, two years in policy (freshman/sophomore) and two years in Public Forum (junior/senior). I attended both nationals and the TOC in public forum.Overview: Having debated in public forum for the last two years I will be more familiar with ‘traditional’ arguments (ie: c/p’s, d/a’s, and case), but don’t let this limit what you run in front of me.
Kritiks: I would like to see a very clear link story, and I probably will have a higher threshold when voting on a kritik.Theory: If there really is in round abuse go for it. Otherwise it’s probably a waste of time.Topicality: Clearly explain the violation along with standards and voters.Speed: I’ve debated public forum for the last two years; it wouldn’t hurt to slow things down a little bit.Tag Team C/X: Don’t dominate your partner’s cross ex.Final Words: At the end of the day all I want is an interesting round. I am open to anything, but it’s on you to make me understand your arguments. Be clear, be smart, and respect your opponents.Feel free to ask me anything.
