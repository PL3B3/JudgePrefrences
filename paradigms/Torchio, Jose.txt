  I have 4 years of both debate and judging experience combined, ill go into deeper detail before an actual debate round (feeling lazy)

I consider myself to be an all around judge, in the sense that my sole purpose in the debate round is to evaluate it and vote on who made the most convincing argument. i don't lean towards a certain argument just because it sounds cool or (yes i would like to live on the moon and save all the waffle reserves in the united states, but that doesn't mean you're gonna win on that)

Now on to the actual reason why you even bothered to click my name 

Topicality - Sure i guess...

Disads - if there is no link or if the link debate is too weak, then you have nothing. at the end of the day if the aff gives me enough reason to reject the disad, nine times outta ten imma do it.

CP/Theory - not a huge fan of CP's, but if ran well enough it can be made a deciding factor in the round. If you're gonna run theory make sure you know EXACTLY what you're talking about an to break it down as much as possible.

Kritiks -if the alt is "do nothing" or "role of the ballot" and you don't explain to me in detail how the alt solves, well.......click here

Case - depends on the case, if you got it you got it.

Performance - By all means, express yourself however you want.
