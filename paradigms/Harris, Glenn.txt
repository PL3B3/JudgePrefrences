Parent Judge

My son is in his third year of competitive policy debate at CK McClatchy High School.

I am a lay judge. I evaluate the round based on stock issues and the persuasiveness of the arguments offered. I do not pretend to have any knowledge about any of the obscura of policy debate, but I try to take detailed notes.

I will not follow you if you spread, sorry I am just not trained to do this.

Hope this helps.
