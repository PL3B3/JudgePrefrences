  Iâ€™m studying to be an industrial and system engineer with a minor in business and statistics and I debated for 4 years at Lake Oswego High School in Oregon (graduated 2014). I coached for Blacksburg High School for a year after that and haven't been as involved in debate since. I know very little about this years topic, which could be good or bad for you.
I am open to hearing the K, framework, performance, topicality, or anything else that you want to read. I truly believe debate should be a very open space where just about any idea can be tested and you should feel motivated to learn a variety of subjects. So I'm not going to be the one to tell you what you can or can't read right off the bat.
That being said, please clearly explain to my why you should be winning the debate and what my ballot or my role as a judge should be.
When I was in high school, I read performance, traditional plans, kritikal plans and everything in between. I really liked Baudrillard (doesn't mean I'll vote on it without a reason).
If you have any questions, you can e-mail me at drewbaer@vt.edu and I'll get back to you almost immediately.
