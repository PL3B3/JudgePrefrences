  Name: Amanda Zigmond
Position: Social Studies teacher, Banneker High School
Years coaching/judging: 2

Overview: I coach a high school team and appreciate teams who clearly articulate their case, fully explain arguments, and respond very directly to the other team’s arguments. I value clarity and efficiency over speed. I tend to favor affs with a workable solution, even if it isn’t the best interpretation. 

Comments on specific argument types:
Impact calculus- please specifically address and compare impacts. Explain your impact.
Kritiks- you need to really explain this for me to find it convincing, so be sure to address the alternative and impacts.

Other comments: 
Please provide a roadmap for each speech and use a structure that clearly explains specific arguments. You need to apply your arguments and “close the loop” to explain your evidence and strategy, not rely on me to do that for your team.
