  Background: I competed in parliamentary debate throughout college, and was in elims of NPDA and NPTE. Parli debate at the college level is somewhat similar to policy, in terms of speed and the types of arguments people run.

I love public policy, and I now work at an organization that does government policy research, so I prefer debates that come down to the policy implications of the plan/counterplan, rather than procedurals or kritiks. However, if you love those, go with them because I’d rather see you debate well.

Speed: Don’t go at the absolute top speed, but you can go quickly. Slow down if you’re running any procedurals or theory arguments and really explain the implications to me. I am familiar with typical theory jargon.

Kritiks: Have good links and specific impacts. Don’t use too much postmodern jargon, because I likely only have passing familiarity with the literature.

Finally, do not make any assumptions about my knowledge of the topic or common arguments that have come up throughout the course of the year.
