  I am the assistant coach at Beacon High School where I teach history. I am a graduate of the University of Texas. I am fairly new to debate but have judged at several tournaments this year, including Yale, Manchester, Villiger and Blake

I am comfortable with Kritiks and other recent developments in high school debate through the students I coach. Bottom line is that I am largely a tabula rasa --you can argue anything but you need to tell me why I should vote for you. If you do not weigh things in the final rebuttals and leave it up to me to do all the work, I will not be happy. So if you are arguing things that are non-traditional policy, or coming up with innovative theoretical arguments about the activity, you need to argue and win the framework debate.
