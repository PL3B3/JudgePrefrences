  Debate parent from Cypress Bay High School in Weston, FL. Years of judging experience: 3 (including VLD at multiple national and many local tournaments) Priorities are good argumentation (I'm an attorney) and effective clash. Speed is okay, but please keep the spread slower than faster (1-4 on a 1-10 scale). I really also appreciate voters so I do not have to do too much work for you. Otherwise, I am open to any arguments that you justify and will take notes during the debate. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions before the round.
