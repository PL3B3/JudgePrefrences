  I am a high school teacher. I am new to debate and I really enjoy it. I have been working with the team for three years. I mostly work with public forum debate. Some preferences:
Public Forum: Please do whatever you like. I am not a big fan of speed or unconventional arguments. I will listen to what you say, however. I want a nice, non-confrontational round. Screaming will not get you my ballot. I am pretty laid back about standing and sitting etc. 
LD: I am more traditional in my LD judging. Look above at PF for general likes and dislikes. However, I also prefer a more traditional round. I like a strong debate about the value premise and criterion. I don't understand why a plan and disads should matter in an activity that is not policy oriented. 
Policy Debate: Nothing I say will help you. If for some reason I am judging you in a policy debate please say your prayers.
