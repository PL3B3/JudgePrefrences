  I am an assistant debate coach (LD) for Alta High.

I debated LD in high school and graduated 4 years ago, I have been coaching/judging since I graduated.

I am really excited about the new turns that circuit LD debate has taken in the past few years, and, as such, I enjoy well-made, well-substantiated theory and kritical argumentation. I'm sure it goes without saying that this style of debate requires more work on the part of the debater, and that it is, in fact, impossible to win a round without doing a sufficent amount of work (as far as establishing framework and such goes). That being said, in my book, the more innovative and unique, the better.

Im not huge on value debate (some people seem to think this can stand alone to win?) as it tends toward the circular and the irresolvable; the value seems more of a formality than anything else (in most rounds). Standard debate is a big deal.

As far as what I vote on, this varies greatly from round to round, and I will usually vote where you tell me to (so tell me!) as long as its not some insane blippy argument.

Speed is a non-issue (meaning you can go as fast or slow as you want).
