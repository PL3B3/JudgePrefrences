As a games theory judge, I'll pretty much vote for anything on the flow, regardless of how insane it is, so long as I'm given a good reason to do so. I won't vote for ink, regardless of how awesome it is, if I'm not told how it impacts the round.

Speed isn't an issue so long as it's speed with a purpose. No dead air. No repetition. I prefer good analysis of a few cards rather than huge card dumps with no analysis.

Topicality bores me. I'll vote on it, of course, but I'll probably be bored. Surprise me and make the T debate entertaining (hint: offense) and you'll have a friend for life.

I love kritik debates... the gooier the better. I expect a different quality of argumentation on the K flow. Don't just dump cards and expect to win it.

You're going to find it difficult to get me to buy an exclusionary framework. Everything's fair game.

Most important: have fun.
