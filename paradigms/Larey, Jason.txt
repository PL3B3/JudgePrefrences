  Jason Larey – Caddo Magnet


I have no preference for argument choice, or at least try to approach judging with that in mind.

I prefer clarity and efficiency over technical block reading. I think arguments are won on the line-by-line, but this is often overlooked when debaters abandon the flow. I don’t like to do the analysis of the evidence for you for an argument that you didn’t apply on the line-by-line.

I don’t always feel the need evidence based on the analysis given in speech time. But, 1 good card is better than 10 bad short cards.

Please be reasonable with flash prep.
