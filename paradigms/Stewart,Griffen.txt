  I would really prefer you not spread. If you do, I probably won't flow. Anything else is fine.

I'm fine with progressive arguments, though I much prefer traditional, value-based debate.

Things like K's are fine, but it better be written very well, run very well, and be unique. I won't vote for generic kritiks.

Any argument you make should be linked back to your framework, and please warrant your normative claims. With anything, tell me why you're right. The more work I have to do for you on the flow, the harder it will be to [[#|win]].

And, any philosophy you run, please run correctly.

I did 3 years of circuit debate, so I can judge any kind of round. Just tell me how you want me to vote, otherwise I'll decide.
