  I am currently a senior in college, judging for Needham High School in Needham, MA (also the school I attended). I have never competed in LD nor have I ever judged it. If you talk fast I will not catch your arguments so don't. I prefer that you simply debate the topic and every argument must be VERY clearly explained and you should articulate exactly why I vote off them in regards to the resolution or I will not vote off them. Be very clear and persausive.
