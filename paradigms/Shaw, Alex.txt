  -I did LD competitively for four years in high school. I am about to finish my PhD at Yale in psychology and have an undergraduate background in Philosophy. 

-I am fine with speed, though I'm sure it is possible for you to spread quickly enough for me not to be able to flow. If this is the case, I'll put my pen down. This hasn't happened to me yet though.

-I refuse to do work on the flow. Tell me what to extend, what your impacts are, what standards I should use to vote and why you win these standards.

- I will vote on anything as long as it is well warranted and clearly impacted. I tend not to vote on topicality unless you can prove some abuse. But I'll listen to anything.
