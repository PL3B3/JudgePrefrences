Topicality - I default to a competing interpretations framework. Personally, I believe that competent affirmative teams have very few problems dismantling arbitrary interpretations; however, you should probably provide a competitive interpretation, as well as warranted reasons why their interpretation is best. I am very receptive to crafty and smart topicality arguments, but I absolutely hate frivolous T arguments. In my book, topicality has two strategic utilities. 1) It can serve as a negative last resort¬ù strategy for debating blatantly untopical cases or 2) It can be used to garner a link to a particular argument or as a tool to make a CP competitive. I prefer the latter of the two.

Theory I am not a theory hack, but that does not mean that if there are warranted arguments I would not vote on them. Frankly, it takes a lot for me to vote on theoretical objections. I think CPs are great for debate, I find very few types of CPs abusive. With that being said, if there are theoretical objections to an argument, I am much more likely to reject the argument, not the team. I see no reason why running Consultations CPs, International Actor CPs, or Condition CPs are reasons why I should sign my ballot Affirmative. Conditionality and Dispositionality arguments won't get you very far, unless the argument is more nuanced (i.e. multiple conditional or dispositional frameworks/arguments are bad).

CP/DA -I love a good "policy" debate. Narrowly tailored strategies that are the product of lots of research make me very happy. A strong link is essential to get me to vote negative.

Kritiks - Much like disadvantages, the link is the essential element of the critique. State bad link arguments get you nowhere in my book. The link needs to be specific and the alternative needs to actually do something! Impact calculus is critical, as it is when debating any other type of argument. Framework debates are sometimes a necessity in kritik debates (Believe me, I know that), but substances debates are much more preferable.

Feel free to debate how you like in front of me. Be nice, have fun, and do what you do best.
