Debated four years high school, four years college, coached and judged for 10 years.

I am primarily interested in the quality of debate. I am looking for clear, persuasive logic that is well presented. Speaking skills are important along with clear thought and insight. I do not think speed is appropriate in LD Debate. I am looking for solid mastery of the philosophical concepts and the ability to apply them to the argument.

I carefully flow all cases and attempt to apply best practices of judging. I am not easily swayed by flashy argument--good solid logic that is clearly presented is more important to me. I think the LD is one of the last bastions of measured, philosophical discussion and I would like to see that maintained.

I am concerned by debaters who use terms and names from philosophers and do not seem to really understand the thought. It is worth displaying a solid grasp of the philosophical concepts. I hope I approach every debate with an open and honest mind--ready to be persuaded by the best debaters.

As an educator, I believe that debate is first and foremost a learning experience. The lessons and skills that I learned in debate have stayed with me for a lifetime. I look forward to passing these along to other students.
