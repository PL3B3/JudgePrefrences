  Lincoln-Douglas Debate Paradigm
 I coached Mountain View and Los Altos High Schools up until 2012 and helped 11 students qualify to the TOC during that time alongside Eric Palmer and others. As a student, I won the TOC in 2006 amongst other things.

I don't judge a lot anymore so my ability to follow fast debate and my knowledge of current debate jargon is not as good as it use to be. I give good speaks for debaters that make well explained and interesting arguments. Feel free to ask me before the round starts if there's anything in particular you'd like to know.
