  La Costa Canyon '16
UCSB '20
I debated for 4 years at La Costa Canyon High School (aka Leucadia Independent). I focused on LD, but dabbled in policy and parli as well. I'm also a first year parli debater at UCSB.

Overview
Debate is your game so play it however you want. I will vote for any argument that you can fully impact back to a ballot. I will try to be as objective as possible and am open to any style of debate you think is best for you.
Every round I will vote using the same mechanism. I will determine what the most viable framework is and vote for whoever has more offense under that framework. That framework could be traditional ethical phil, role of the ballot, theory arg, etc.
Weighing is important.

K
Probably 90% of my 1NCs sophomore through senior year consisted of me reading a single K and answering case so I'm sympathetic and comfortable with the strategy. Give a good overview in the 2NR so I know what the argument is before I vote on it.

Framework
Despite how often I read the K, I'm a really big fan of traditional ethical philosophy and I've read a fair amount of it. That means I'll usually be able to follow along. Just like with the K, if you're reading dense phil explain your shit so I know what I'm voting for.

Theory
All I ask is that you slow down for interps and the name of each standard. I wasn't the best theory debater, but if that's your thing then do your thing. I'm not going to be the most comfortable in a muddle theory debate with 7 layers, but I'll certainly try my hardest.
I'm indifferent to whether you use theory as a strategic instrument. Debate's a game, you make the rules.

Speaks
Ways to get good speaks in front of me:
- Debate well
- Express yourself (whatever that means to you)
- Enjoy yourself
- Use CX
- Be humorous
- Read an interesting position
Of course some of these are more important than others.

Finally, enjoy debate because that's all that's gonna matter when it's over.
