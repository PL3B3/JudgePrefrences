  February 2011 â€“ I am new to the arena of judging for a debate tournament. As such, I am slowly developing a philosphy.

As to my personal feelings when dicussing/debating a subject:

- Clear, concise, and logical aurguments are important with supporting evidence/facts 
- Speed .. I do not enjoy or like speed. I have great difficulty following the speed debater and the points raised in argument. Quality goes a lot farther than quantity. Speed is a negative as the arguments are lost on me. Fast is ok, speed is not
- Repetition of the same points try my patieince, unless there is a logical reason for the repetition.
