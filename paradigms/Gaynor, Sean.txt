My philosophy is simple - follow the rules. There are no burdens of proof in PF. There is NO talking to each other except during prep time. Most importantly - follow the names of the speeches you're giving. This is especially important during Final Focus. Do NOT summarize for me, FOCUS on why you win!  Quite honestly, some of the best final focuses I've seen are only 15 seconds long, because you've presented all your evidence; now just hammer in your point. Other than that, please stick to the resolution - while I usually judge CFL where there are no low point wins, if I think a team should have less points BUT win, I'll give them the win (and high points).
