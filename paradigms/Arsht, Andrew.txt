  Argument stuff:

There is such a thing as zero risk

T – Clear distinctions supported by grammar/government definitions are usually more compelling than limits, but rarely backed up by good evidence – ergo, cards are a big deal

Links must be unique, but uniqueness does not “determine” or necessarily strengthen the link argument

Conditionality – 2 is fine, 3 is pushing it, 4 is dumb

Aff leaning on counterplan competition, neg leaning on counterplan legitimacy
2a’s should talk about 1 – what the basis for competition should be, 2 – what the negative justifies and why that’s bad, 3 – why the neg’s model of opportunity cost is rigged

2n’s should 1 – read definitions of words in the plan text, not just the resolution, 2 – establish the relevance of the difference between the plan and the counterplan to the topic, 3 – establish the desirability of testing the difference between the plan and the counterplan to debate

Word PICs – seem trivial unless the aff makes an argument that discourse is important to their advocacy

Performance – I’m pretty good for the neg on framework, but negative teams often advance standards that are easily impact turned – e.g. limits, policy education, etc. – one way the 2n can hedge his or her bets is to extend impact defense to the case

Stuff you shouldn’t drop no matter what – value to life, turns case, role of the ballot

Speaker point stuff:

Be nice (or polite if you can’t manage nice), act like you want to be there
Cross-x – reference it in speeches, ask about relevant issues
Go for defense – talk about what their cards say, don’t say, why that matters
Don’t steal prep – this means stop writing/typing while the jump drive is being passed around
Even ifs – recognizing where you’re behind and adjusting
Blowing off stupidity – A-spec comes to mind
Clarity is very very important, excessive volume is just annoying

I was going to make a joke about Peter Vale being slow, but that seems a little mainstream
