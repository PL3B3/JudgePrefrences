  In judging, I prefer clear, concise, and slow speech because I flow. Spewing is unnecessary and if the student(s) do so, I may stop the entire round. Speaking so fast that it is difficult to follow and understand is not debate. Please, no AGD's. Citations are important and I do track them. Please have them available if the other team asks, stating "they are not with me(us)" shows lack of organization and thoroughness. In crossfire, I expect polite, considerate and professional behavior. Bullying the other team(s) and allowing them to not answer the question asked is not debate. Debate is between two or more individuals, not one.I choose the winner of the round based on clear, concise, organized and thorough case presentations. If the arguments are presented stronger, ie, hitting all of the opponents contentions, disproving the opponents contentions, recent citations/evidence, confidence in presentation, clear diction and professional appearance and body language (ie no gum chewing, touching hair or clothes, or excessive hand gestures as it is distracting).
