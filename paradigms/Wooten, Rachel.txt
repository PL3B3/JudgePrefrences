  I will keep this relatively short.  
 
I believe that it is your job as debaters to shape the round. I will vote on any argument as long as it is impacted well. However, there are a couple of things that will help me sign the ballot at the end of the round. 
 
I love impact calc and think it should start before the 2AR/2NR. The more in-depth explanation of the impacts the better, as well as explanation of how they relate to the impacts of your opponent. 
My threshold on theory and topicality is usually that I want to see abuse in round.  
I think overviews are really great tools to explain where you are winning and why it is important but they should be brief.  
 
Ask me specific questions in round.
