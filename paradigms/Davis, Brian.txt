  Greetings!

My name is Dr. Brian Davis and I am the Head Speech and Debate Coach at Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch Colorado. I have experience judging LD at the local, state, and national level (both TOC and NFL Nationals). Below, I have listed some things that are helpful for you to know as you prepare to debate in front of me.

Spreading - if you are someone who speed reads from a computer screen while only occasionally coming up for air, please be aware that this does not impress me at all. I prefer quality argumentation to sheer volume of arguments. Spreading is a useless life skill unless you plan on being the voice reading terms and conditions at the end of a commercial - I do not teach it or encourage it, but I am capable of following it in a debate.

Theory and Topicality - Make sure that you are very clear about what you are doing and why I should vote for it.

Framework - A V/VC framework is always welcome. If you venture into more ontological, meta-ethical, or epistemological waters, please make sure you are very clear about how your framework operates in relation to the resolution.

Policy Arguments, Off Case Positions, and Kritik cases - run them at your own risk - I am less interested in the game of debate and more interested in direct argumentative clash that is centered on the resolution at hand. Since we really don't run these things in Colorado, I may not appreciate what you are trying to do.
