  I debated for 4 years in high school, have some exposure in college. Now, I coach a UDL school that competes on TFA and UDL circuit. 

I am open to most everything so long as it is properly warranted. I value when competing warrants are explained and impacted both in real and theoretical terms, as long as you prove which matters more. Do not expect me to know all of your lit, but know I am willing to evaluate all of it. 

CP: If it is competitive and can solve better than the Aff then I will vote for it. 
T: Extra-T, FX-T are legitimate on this year's resolution 
K: Prove it outweighs Aff
Theory: I have a high threshold for theory.

On speed, I would say I can handle a 4 out of 5. 

The one thing that is treacherous territory with me is when affluent interests advocate for social/racial/economic change for disadvantaged populations and the ones doing the advocating both a) have no experience with them and b)genuinely do nothing to assist these populations outside the round. To me it is near impossible to escape the performative contradiction of you utilizing these circumstances for personal gain, i.e. attempting to win rounds and ultimately awards.
