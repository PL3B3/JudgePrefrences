  I debated LD for The Blake School in Minneapolis from 2010-12. I also worked at VBI, NSD, and IDE this last summer. 

I'll listen to whatever arguments you want to run as long as the ballot story is clear. I tend to think in terms of comparative worlds, but if you want to justify something else that's cool too. 

To be fair, I have probably lost some of my ability to flow speed since I haven't judged a lot this year. That said, I'm still ok with most speed as long as you slow down for that list of 20 analytics at the top of your AC. I’ll say clear.

I don’t mind theory debate. I default competing interps, but if you make arguments for reasonability that’s fine too. I feel very comfortable voting on RVIs if they are justified. Make sure you have internal links between your standards and voters or my RFD will be awkward for you.

I try to average about a 27.5, but I think my real average is a little higher. If you want good speaks be good or be funny. If you don't know how to be funny ask Drew McCormick. 


Feel free to ask if you have specific questions.
