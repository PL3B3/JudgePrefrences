  I did CX debate in high school (2002-2007) for five years. 
I have coached all debate events at Meyers HS for the past 4 years. Our area (northeast PA) lacks CX debate so I don't judge it very much. I judge LD and PF for the most part.

CX paradigm:
I understand all the basics very well. I was never a fan of Critiques, but I have judged them plenty of times.
I like moderate speed when you speak well and clear. I don't think spreading always helps teams.
T is my favorite argument when done well. I like CPs as well. Case and DA args are necessary to win a debate. I really like a good theory debate as well.
I like good clash and real debating, basic debating skills are a rarity as so many teams just read cards.
Just reading cards will almost always get you a loss with me.

LD preferences:
I will judge on anything. I like a good balance of fact and philosophy. Clash is very important in an LD debate.
If you don't tell me why you win then you probably should not win.
Speed is fine with me.
