  I am a trained newcomer to LD debate judging, having only judged a few rounds in the past. I am a traditional judge. I'd like to see a value and a value criterion. Tell me how these two function together and why they're important. I am not well versed in philosophy so please explain it in a way the average person would understand. Speak at a rate of speed which average person would understand. I'd like to see a substantive debate about the topic and only the topic. Please ask me questions about what I would like to hear before the round starts in order to help you. Avoid debate jargon, I know some, but play it safe. Tell me exactly how the round should be decided in your last speech. Make sure you weigh arguments for me. Be polite to your opponent and to me. The most important aspect to me would be to refute your opponent's arguments. Overall, treat me as if I am a average person off the street who knows how to fill out a ballot, because debate is about persuasion.
