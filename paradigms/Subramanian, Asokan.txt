  This is my third year of judging parli debate. I travel often with the team and have judged at league, state, state/national qualifiers and invitationals including Logan, UOP and Stanford (last year). I like debaters to have clear communication, good evidence and examples, and to be civil during their rounds. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't seem to me like they focus on the main question being asked in the resolution. Clash is central to BOTH sides of the debate. I do flow, but I have my own system, so I appreciate signposting. A parli debater who has an obviously literate and extended approach to the topic will always get my ballot, rather than a debater who loses logic in trying to be too narrow/creative. This is especially true for "open motions".
