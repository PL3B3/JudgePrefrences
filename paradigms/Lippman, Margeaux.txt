  I increasingly find that students ask "what's your paradigm?" without a) reading the Wiki or b) knowing what they're asking. I really think "what's your paradigm?" is a silly question - if you have specific questions, please ask.

That said, I think debate is best done when the students, well, just debate. Make well-warranted arguments, don't be a jerk, and have a clear advocacy. That's all I ask - I'll evaluate anything and everything. Debate is about you learning something, not about me and what I like to listen to. :)

As far as experience goes, I debated in college, coached college teams, etc. etc.
