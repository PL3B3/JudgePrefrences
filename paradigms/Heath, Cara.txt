  I have been judging for 4 years and coaching for 2 years. I am mainly an LD judge but also do PF and Congress. My biggest thing as a judge is following through your arguments and linking it all back to the topic at hand. I also look for well supported arguments, this includes both evidence and logic. You as the debator have to convince me that I should take your side and to do that it need to be well reasoned, supported, and tied together.
