I’m a junior at Woodward Academy, and this will be my third year of debate. 

I would like debaters to be nice — being competitive does not take away from your ability to be nice. I prioritize clarity over speed, and please don’t try to be cheaty with speech docs, etc. Feel free to read what you feel comfortable with, but know I prefer Affs to be topical. My judge philosophy is very similar to Maggie Berthiaume’s (coach at Woodward).
