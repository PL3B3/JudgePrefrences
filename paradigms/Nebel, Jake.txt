  I debated for four years at Trinity Prep (FL) and coached for four years at Greenhill (TX). I'm now a graduate student in Philosophy at NYU and run Victory Briefs.

I will vote on any argument, so long as I understand it. Two notes about this:

I have to understand it in the first speech, when you first make the argument. I won't vote for an argument that starts out incomprehensible and ends up crystal clear. If I don't understand it in the first speech, then it's unfair for me to expect your opponent to answer it.I often don't understand things that others (at least, claim to) understand. So please be clear, and explain your arguments in detail. Complex, counterintuitive arguments tend to need more (and slower) explanation than simple, intuitive arguments. (But, of course, even simple, intuitive arguments need solid evidence.)
With that in mind, run what you want, be respectful, and have fun! Ask me before the round if you have any questions.
