  I am a member of Toastmasters and have been active within Toastmaster for approximately thirty years. As I look at the debates, I am not as concerned with fact check as much as I look at how the debaters present the total package. Tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, hand and body movement. Use of language is important. Does the speaker sound like he knows what he is saying, or do they make verbal gaffs (i.e., 'ahs, ums) or do they double clutch words (i.e., I.....I....and....and) before completing sentences. 

Was the speaker 'engaging?" By engaging, did they draw the audience into the speech. Did they use an appropriate anecdote, or symbolism to make their point.
