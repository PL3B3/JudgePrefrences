  The rules of debate are simple: abide by time limits, debate the resolution, and be courteous. If you choose to run an alternative weighing mechanism to the value/standard format, tell me why I should use your decision calculus to weigh the round. I will judge any type of argumentation including burdens, theory, kritiks, etc. so long as they are warranted, extended, and impacted. Be sure to externally weigh your arguments against your opponent’s arguments throughout the round and crystallize at the end.
Speed is fine; be clear. If necessary, slow down for tag lines and author names.
To win my ballot, outline the arguments you are winning and externally weigh them with your opponents’ winning arguments. Tell me the levels of argumentation: what I should look to first and why you are winning it, what I should look to second, etc. Tell me what matters in the round and impact it to the decision calculus. If you are clear, strategic, courteous, and intelligent you will get high speaks.
Good luck!
