I debated LD in high school for four years and am currently a member of HSPDS.

Honest engagement with the resolution and intelligibility are key; not favorably disposed towards kritiks or the latest post-structuralist fads. Nothing against heterodox positions, but originality and watertightness should be givens. Semantic hand-wringing and jargon-vomiting are decidedly unappealing, and don't expect me to see a grab-bag of cards as anything more than tinder for the flame of logical argumentation.
