First Year Coach

This is my first year coaching policy debate. SO YOU NEED TO GO REAL SLOW AS I CANNOT FLOW SPEED DEBATE YET.

I have been trained as a tabula rosa judge. I will weigh the advantages versus the disadvantages in determining who won. I am not as familiar with Kritiks or counterplans. It is essesntial that you explain your voting criteria for me in your last rebuttals.
