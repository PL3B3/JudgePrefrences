I am currently the head coach at Northside High School in Warner Robins, GA. This is my 2nd year coaching high school debate and my 6th year in the activity. I debated in high school and judged in college but did not compete on the college circuit. I have judged 6 tournaments this year, about 30 rounds total and over 100 rounds last year. I spend most of my time stuck in JV rounds because I tend to be a "helping" judge with critiques after the round that focus on team improvement.

Preferences:
Likes: theory, original arguments, analysis
Hates: generic DAs, teams who don't understand their own arguments, not engaging to other team

I try to be as tabula rosa as possible. Everything is debatable to me. I allow performance Affs (though they aren't my favorite) and I enjoy kritics and theory arguments. I hate hearing the exact same round five times in a tournament so I prefer DAs that are not camp generated and are updated frequently. I will vote on anything including theory, impacts, topicality or framework adn I feel that the purpose of debate is to research and make good arguments not too read as much evidence as possible. I like speed, I can flow anything as long as it is remotely clear, but reading more evidence than the other team won't win you the round if you never engage the other team. Debate should involve confrontation between the two sides at some point.
