  I debated 4 years at Eastside High School, and have debated on local, regional, and national circuit.

It doesn't matter to me what you go for in the round. I'll listen to anything that makes sense.
Speed is fine, but be clear. I'll let you know if you're not. Second time I yell clear, speaks will be docked.
When I debated in high school, I mostly went for substance, and theory. I rarely ran Ks, or any other weird positions.
That is not to say that debaters shouldn't, it just means that I may not be as well versed in that kind of literature.
An argument is an argument, so if it is explained well, i will adjudicate it impartially.

Things I like:
- Starting off the 2NR and 2AR with a roadmap of reasons why you should win. I think crystallization makes flowing the rest of the speech infinitely easier, and makes it easier for me to vote for you. Your last speeches should basically be my RFD.
- Good framework debates. Interesting framework positions are always welcome, and if ran well, will merit high speaks.
- Good argument interaction. Make it clear why an argument on one side of the flow interacts with another on the other side.
- Good theory debates. Make sure to weigh standards if need be. I'm receptive to RVIs if well argued. I view theory as competing interp, not reasonability, but i'm not opposed to viewing it as the latter. I think Fairness is a voter. except as a last resort, don't waste your time reading your 10 reasons. They're probably bad anyways.
- Food. any type of food is muy bueno. Drinks are pretty good, too. I'm not picky.

Things I don't like
- Reading arguments that are hard to understand incredibly fast.
- one sentence spikes or a prioris. A priori's are fine, just explain them thoroughly. I will not evaluate the arg if you blow it up to a 2 minute rant if it was a sentence in the first speech.
- bad theory debates. Don't read out 4 theory shells as a time sucks. I'll be very receptive to RVI's then. Read it only if there's a clear abuse.
- bad framework debates


Few things to keep in mind
- go at a slower pace for the tags. you can blitz through the card, but hearing the tags make it much easier for me to flow the warrants in the card.slow down and be loud for author names.
- Enunciate when you're going fast, and avoid an annoying tone. One of my pet peeves is a whiny tone.
- CX is binding.
- Extensions need to be properly made. If the argument is completely dropped, then you only need to extend the claim, but if it's a contested argument, explain the warrant. Most importantly, explain why it matters. Explain how it interacts with other arguments on the flow. Weighing is key to my ballot. If you weigh well, you most likely will win.
- I try to avoid intervention, but if a card blatantly doesn't have any warrants even if it is dropped, I will be inclined to look elsewhere on the flow for reasons to vote.
- I don't care what you wear, or whether you sit or stand.
- Don't be rude to your opponent. I will give you low speaks if you're unnecessarily yelling in CX. Relax. It's only a debate round.
- Feel free to ask me any questions before the round!
