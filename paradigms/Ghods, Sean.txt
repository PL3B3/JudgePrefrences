  Background: I was a nationally competitive debater at Mercer Island High School. I qualified to the TOC 3 times and was consistently in elims of national tournaments.

Run whatever you are most comfortable with â€“ I have run affs from 8 minutes of heg good to 8 minutes of debate structures bad. Just please understand the arguments you are running.

I won't do work for you. Extend and explain the arguments you want me to evaluate in your last rebuttal. Provide a framework for how you want me to evaluate the round. The team that wins the framework to evaluate the round usually ends up winning.

FYI: This is my first time judging on this topic.
