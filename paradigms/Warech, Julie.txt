I debated full-time my freshman and sophomore year at Fort Lauderdale High School, but only part-time Junior and Senior year. Debate the way you enjoy it; not just what you think I will vote on. I'm fine with any form of argumentation, it just needs to be articulated well and supported by evidence. 


Just a few general things:
Comparative impact calculus is a must; whether it's a DA, theory debate, or a T debate, you should be using it.
Love a good CP/Case debate - I think a good 4 minutes on case is most educational and puts a lot of pressure on the 2AC
If you're going for the K you should spend time adequately addressing the framework and what the ballot signifies. Discussion of the alternative and how it functions is also critical in getting my ballot.
I do not go for contradictions good debate, so if you are arguing a K about language/rhetoric do not be using that same language/rhetoric you are arguing against in the political realm. It defeats the purpose of kritics and makes the symbolism of the ballot meaningless.
Conditionality is probably good, but there are definitely some instances where it could be bad - Just impact out the arg.
Severance/Intrinsic permutations are almost never reasons to reject the team - Bugs me when kids make the one word blip and expect to win the round on the phrase. If you are going to go for it, have a good impact calculus.
Speeds fine, just be understandable/clear. Especially on authors, dates. This will both help your speaker points as well as your ethos in the round.
CrossX - Be Aggressive; make jokes. Just don't be a flat out asshole with no funny incorporated. Nobody likes that.
Also, remember there are strategic costs and strategic benefits towards any strategy you utilize. Think it out, and have fun debating!
