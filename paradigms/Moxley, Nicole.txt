Short Version - I'll listen to whatever - my predispositions are below, but as long as anything is explained and debated well, I'll vote on almost anything.



Topicality -
Perfectly fine, I usually default to competing interpretations, but will evaluate it however you tell me too.


DAs - Considering that approx 70% of my 1NR's were politics, I love a good disad debate. For the neg, make sure you have a clear link story and the aff should always contest the link because this year especially links are terrible. Also, 2 politics notes - make sure you're aware of whats going on in congress, who's pushing the bill, etc, and pls pronounce boehner correctly.


CPs - Love em - few specifics -
- I probably lean aff on most CP theory but winning cp theory as the neg is pretty easy too - i'm also not sure why peopled don't read more multiplank counterplans theory
- PICs and process cps are probably bad for debate and if you run them I will be sad - ugh especialy ones that are like "do the whole aff except don't export natural gas to europe" like pls no 


Ks -
- My partner and I have read k's ranging from neolib to les sep this year but that doesn't mean that a. i'm a k hack or b. am down for a dng debate - k's are perfectly fine, but if its anything out of the core topic generics, they need a good explantation and link story - don't use a bunch of buzzwords and think I'm going to understand all of it
- I HATE hearing a bunch of pre-written blocks that have nothing to do with the aff - you should have specific reasons why your alt/impact(s) turn/interact with the aff
- Pet peeve - people being like "there's gonna be an overview" and then have the overview be 5 MINUTES - keep the overview short, and embed most of it on the line by line

Case -
- PEOPLE UNDERUSE THE CASE DEBATE like honestly aff internal links are so laughable please call them out
- There can also be a VERY LOW risk of an aff
- I like impact turn debates, but usually feel pain judging them because they get sooooo messy - if it's your thing, go for it, but please keeps it clean

Theory
- I HATE judging theory debates - I'm good with things like questions of counterplan competition/legitimacy stuff, but I hate condo debates
- Condo is almost always good - I'm not really
- Don't go for conditionality just because you want to - only go for it if you have to
- 20 seconds in the 1AR is NOT enough for me to pull the trigger

Prep Time 
I don't take prep for flashing unless its before the 1NR and if you don't have it flashed by the end of 2NC C/X thats when prep starts - 13+ minutes is enough time for you to flash 

More fun facts that may or may not help you -
- Pet Peeve - do not say "I'll might read more cards, and I'll just give them to you at the end of the speech" - only time this is acceptable to send the card after the speech is when your partner brings it up to you - if you say that you "might read more cards" those should be in the speech doc that you already have flashed the people - 99% of the time, people read those extra cards, so just put them in the speech doc - it's SO frustrating waiting for people to flash them when they knew they were going to read them before the speech and wastes everyones time after the speech and before prep because they didn't want them to have those cards - I know this is super long and ranty, but its a major pet peeve and i will dock your speaks if it happens
- I love cats and terrible movies and jokes about anyone on the alpharetta debate team - especially chris moxley
- Puns please
- Jokes mAKE ME SO HAPPY SO MAKE THEM IF YOU CAN the worse the joke the better
- I have a terrible poker face - no srsly this is not a joke
- BE CLEAR do not sacrifice clarity for speed
- Prep ends when you're saving it - I'm really incompetent when it comes to computers, so I feel your pain

HAVE FUN AND DON'T BE MEAN.
