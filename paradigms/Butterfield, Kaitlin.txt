  Experience: I debated for three years at Bingham High School, and am currently a freshman
debater at Weber State University.

Specifics:
Affirmatives: I am indifferent on whether an aff should be “kritikal” or “straight-up”. Whichever
works for you, I’m okay with.
Topicality: Not a huge fan of topicality, but if you feel like an aff is extremely untopical then feel
free to go for it. Make sure there’s a clear impact, and not just buzz words like “education” or
“ground”.
Disads: They’re dece. Just keep the flow clean, and make sure there’s some sort of argument
clash.
Counterplans: I really like CP/DA debates. They’re lots of fun. Make sure the counterplan is
competitive, and make sure there is actually some sort of net benefit to the counterplan.
Kritiks: These are probably my favorite. I really like the sort of impact debates that these come
down to, but it has to actually link to the aff. If the link isn’t clear, don’t go for it.
Framework: I think framework debates can get pretty interesting. I don’t have any preconceived
ideas of how a framework debate should be played out, so just do your thing.
Theory: I really dislike theory debates. I evaluate it pretty much the same way I would evaluate
topicality. But if something isn’t really that abusive, don’t go for the theory arg. I mean unless
they totally conceded it. Then yes, please go for it.
Speaker Points: I will reward you for being nice to everyone in the room. I really dislike hostility
in debate rounds, so just be civil towards each other please. Don’t use any sort of offensive
language, or your points will be dropped.

No, I don’t count prep for flashing. But don’t prep while you flash.
