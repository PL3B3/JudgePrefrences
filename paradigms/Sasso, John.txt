  If you're looking for a judge you can pander to, please don't pref me.

I'm just going to start this by saying that I disagree pretty heavily with the current iteration of paradigms where judges list all the arguments they don't want to be read in front of them, or where they tell you how they evaluate arguments. I don't believe the judge has the jurisdiction to do that--it should be up to the debaters. I'm more than willing to discuss why I feel this way, but I feel that these paradigms only serve to make debate monolithic and are a self-aggrandizing tool for the judges.

All you should need to know is that I graduated from Strake Jesuit in 2014, competed at TFA/NSDA/TOC, and that I ask you to make a short pause after card names and bullet points if you're going to spread. Read what you're most passionate about in front of me. If you have a specific question, feel free to email me @ jsasso@me.com or just message me on facebook.
