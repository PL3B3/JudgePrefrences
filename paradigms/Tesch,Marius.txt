  In brief, I am a lay debate judge and enthusiast, but one with a deep interest in and knowledge of philosophy. Prior to becoming an A.P. and Honors World History Teacher at Timber Creek High School in Orlando, Florida, I studied at the University of Central Florida and the Freie Universität zu Berlin. I hold two undergraduate degrees and one graduate degree. 

As a rather holistic judge, I flow and listen intently to your arguments. Framework is key, but because of my background, it is ill advised to throw around political or social philosophy in an attempt to undermine your opponent simply as a strategic ploy. That being said, I am open to theory arguments and Ks. Please have a thorough understanding of the theories with which you frame your arguments. I don’t believe in speed for speed’s sake, but appreciate the need to voice contentions in the timeframe allotted. As such, I handle spreading well when it is articulate and enunciated clearly. I am quick to vote against arguments that are illogical or do not impact and link the evidence in each contention clearly.
