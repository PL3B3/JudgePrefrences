LD: I am a value oriented judge. I look for traditional argumentation. I have a hard time accepting the cross over of CX in to LD, but I am learning. I vote on persuasion and flow.

CX: I am open to all arguments. I know that some can be off the wall, but if the debaters can clearly explain their argument and persuade me it out weighs their opponent they can have my ballot.

PF: I am learning more about PF. I look for Persuasion and a clean final focus.

Student Congress: I am looking for debate and not a bunch of extemp speeches. If I want extemp I can judge FX/DX
