I debated for three years at Hopkins High School in Minnetonka, MN. I was coached by Adam Torson. That was from 2006-2009.

Speed: I judge at most once a year , so my listening/flowing skills are very rusty. Not lay-judge rusty, but I'm getting closer every year. I'll try to say 'speed', but if I've said that, it's likely that I've already missed something. I don't have a concrete speed after which I cannot flow - my body language/a confused look on my face will probably be a better signal that you are going too fast. If the issue is clarity, rather than speed, I am less likely to say something.

I don't exclude any type of argument/case structure on face (aside from blatant racism/homophobia/things like that) - no matter what you run, make sure you are explaining how it functions in the round. Don't assume that I'm aware of any philosophical concept, or that I'm up to date on current debate jargon. I'd recommend slowing down a bit for theory (especially for taglines/structural elements).

Debate I prefer to see: I like smart, substantive debate. I will always prefer a couple of really good, strategic arguments over a bunch of bad ones. Using strategic, positional arguments will help speaker points-wise. Please make full extensions, with warrant/impact. How in depth the extension should be can definitely vary depending on how contested the argument is. I don't like intervening, but when forced to, I will try to do as little as is required to make a decision.

I don't care if you sit down, etc, just try to speak clearly. Please be nice to each other. Common sense etiquette applies to laptop usage etc. If I call evidence after the round (unless a debater specifically asks me to in-round), it is rarely because I have not made a decision, but usually because I want to reference a specific part in my RFD.

Feel free to ask me any questions before the round, even if it's already been covered here.
