  Debate Background: 
- Bronx High School of Science
- 4 years in PF
- Judged at local tournaments (Regis) 

Speed: I prefer a slow round. I understand the temptation to cram as much information as possible into a 40 minute round, but I cannot base my vote simply off of speed. Try and slow it down for me and really get me to care why your evidence is more important/outweighs your opponent. 

Evidence: I will only read evidence at the end of the round if I feel it was disagreed upon and made the main focus of the flow. 

Some of my preferences:
- clarity 
- weighing arguments 
- being polite through out the round
- have a little sense of humor
- not being absurd with your evidence or rebuttals. 
- DO NOT BE EVASIVE DURING THE ROUND (answer the questions asked, don't ignore them)
