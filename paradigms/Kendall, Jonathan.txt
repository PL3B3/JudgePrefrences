Judging Philosophy

First, I flow; I endeavor to keep track of each argument, rebuttal, and refutation.

Cases:
I am looking for overall persuasiveness-- I am looking for a robust value structure, clearly warranted contentions, plausible impact, and sufficient evidence. Not a fan of spreading. I can take a brisk pace, but if you lose me, it's your fault.

XC:
Seek to understand. I like strategic lines of questioning, but not clever tricks.

Rebuttal/Refutation:
Signpost, of course. Explain clearly. Rely less on verbatim block quotes and more on clear explanations, employing apt evidence. Be thorough, but don't rush.

Closing:
Spell it out, fairly, why you should win.
