  Experience:
I debated for the Utah circuit all throughout high school. I now do parli debate for the University of Utah.(AKA I understand policy jargon.)
Overall paradigm:
Run whatever you want at whatever speed pleases you. I am happy to vote on any arguments that you win. This means I will vote on theory, kritiks, DA's, CP's, etc. I consider myself a tabula rasa judge and will not come in with any biases as towards the arguments the debate should be about. I VOTE OFF OF FLOW 10/10 TIMES.
Speaker point range:
I usually give between 25-30, with anything below a 25 meaning that the speaker has made a huge mistake. I basically only give speaker points based on your strategy, so don't feel like you need to be a good speaker to pick up my ballot.
Speed:
Go as fast as you would like, given that you slow down when I need to write down taglines. If your opponent doesn't like speed, be courteous and slow down if they yell clear.
Disclosure
Despite what anyone will tell me, I will always be a strong proponent of disclosing. I feel that without disclosure, I am not doing my duty as a judge and am forcing a time deficit that hinders the improvement of the debaters that I am judging. I will disclose my decision with rationale, give brief critiques, and then be willing to answer any questions from any debaters.
