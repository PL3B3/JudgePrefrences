  Greetings Debaters. I am Cathy Wilson from Iowa City, Iowa. I am a high school English teacher, and having majored in English, I like to see contentions backed up with good evidence. In terms of speed, the debaters should keep it at a maximum of six out of ten. I will NOT say slow down more than once. If you continue to speed after having been warned, you will lose speaker points. I cannot give you credit for having made arguments if I cannot understand you. It is the debater's job to respect the paradigm of the judge.

I believe cross-ex to be binding, and debaters who do a poor job of answering questions will not receive high speaker points. However, debaters who do a solid job of questioning will receive good speaker points. Another way to receive good speaker points is by standing still, making eye contact and being organized with your papers. Having an organized speech is critical for your speakers points and for a win.

Good luck with your debating, and remember to enjoy the event!
