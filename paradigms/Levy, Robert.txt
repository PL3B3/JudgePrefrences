  I am a first year judge with experience in the event of mostly congress; however, I appreciate the art of Lincoln-Douglas debate as my son competed in it his first year. Although I have no experience in national tournaments, I have judged locally throughout my son's four years. Speedwise, I prefer a level of about 6-7 or a junior-varsity level debater as this is my first time judging nationally.
