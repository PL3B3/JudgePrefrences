  I graduated from Lexington High School in MA in 2013. I competed both locally and on the national circuit during my 4 years in debate and most recently coached WDM Valley during the 2013-2014 season.
I find substance more interesting than theory.

I do not require theory to be run in the interp/vio/standards/voter format, but a successful theory arg will most likely have all those components. I am not interested in voting either way on semantic I meet/interp stuff.

1. I do not believe in presumption because I think there is always a risk of offense
2. no theoretical justifications for frameworks - I will ignore them and drop your speaks

Feel free to clarify any of these preferences via email or before the round, because I realize they can set off a lot of red flags or warning bells.

I will make you slow down until I can actually flow at least 90-95% of the arguments you are making. I debated in a style where (in retrospect) I am reasonably certain most of my judges could not get down every argument I made, but picked them up in rebuttals/CX/later explanation, etc. I will not vote on or acknowledge arguments that I did not flow originally, and I will tell you to slow down until you are at that point.
