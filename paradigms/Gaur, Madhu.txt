  I am a parent judge with 2 years of judging LD. Speed should be medium to slow, otherwise I will drop you. The debate over the value/value criterion is extremely important, so please make sure you do it well.

Circuit arguments, such as plans, theory, and K's, are not going to be voted on unless they are explained very well. Explain debate jargon, since I am not familiar with most of the terms.

Overall, be clear, and explain your arguments well. Voters should be included in the 2AR and 2NR.
