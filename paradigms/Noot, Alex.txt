I am currently a freshman at Northwestern University with an intended major in economics and minor in philosophy. I've had three years of debate experience (two policy and one public forum).

Paradigm: "The Philosopher and the Physician"

Flow - centricNon - interventionistSpeed - friendly
But even though rounds are won and lost on the flow, speaker points are won and lost off the flow (i.e. crossfire).

Therefore, on the flow you should be the philosopher presenting a clear framework in which to evaluate the round in for me and then using that framework to weigh the arguments therein, and off the flow you should be the physician, painlessly and effortlessly identifying and removing your opponents arguments yet leaving them alive.

In case you haven't noticed, I thoroughly enjoy italicizing words I believe to be especially important.
