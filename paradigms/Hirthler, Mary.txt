  I debate for 4 years in high school for Meyers. I currently go to Georgetown, but I do not do college debate.

I will vote on anything as long as you explain it well / tell me why you win. I was never a K debater, but I will vote for one. I do not have any strong preferences to arguments, speed etc.
