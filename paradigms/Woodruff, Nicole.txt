  Experience: I have 4 years of experience in high school policy debate at CK McClatchy, and a semester of policy at Arizona State University. I currently coach policy debate at Chandler Preparatory High (since Spring 2014) and at BASIS Chandler (since Spring 2017).
In general I try to remain as open as possible regarding what arguments I will evaluate, and am wiling to listen to any argument that you can defend is relevant to my decision. Make sure to tell me how I should be evaluating arguments, how to characterize arguments and how to weigh arguments. The more freedom I am given to make decisions in how to deal with those issues, the more likely I am to make decisions that hurt your position in the round.
Please ask me if there is anything more specific that you would like to know than what is included in this paradigm.
