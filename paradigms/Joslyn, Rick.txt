  Rick Joslyn - Judging Philosophy
Wake Forest Debater

This is my second year of policy debate. Though I am still learning the intricacies of policy debate, I love argumentation and the clash of solid ideas.

I value topicality more than anything and stress the importance of retaining the integrity of the topic. Therefore, forays into alternative uses for debate space besides the assigned topic will only annoy me.

I lean conservative on most issues, and enjoy clever implementations of neoconservatism on foreign policy. That being said, I value quality arguments every time and I will not hesitate to vote against my personal ideology. 

I also dismiss attempts to paint the opposition as racist, sexist, etc, unless it is obvious and clearly warps their argument. Your opponents, likely, are not actually racist, sexist, etc. Playing the race/gender card is cheap and really turns me off.

As for debate, I enjoy an intensive discussion with clever, bold tactics and solid, germane arguments. Don't be afraid to be BOLD, as I greatly respect teams who take risks with their arguments.

A good disad can win the neg a debate and it is my favorite tactic, I will look for it as an excuse to vote neg. K's are okay, but you absolutely MUST be able to explain them well or I will not consider voting for it. 

Good ethos will impress me and I enjoy the passion of debate as much as the substance. If it gets a little fiery, I will only enjoy the debate more unless you are blatantly disrespectful to you opponent. Passion and stylistic presentations of your arguments will also help.
