  I debated four years of national circuit policy debate in high school for Nevada Union. This is my first foray back into the debate community since I graduated which means I have very little topic specific knowledge, so keep this in mind when using acronyms etc.

Good case debates and aff specific links/arguments make me very happy.

Racism, homophobia, sexism, classism etc will not be tolerated. I’ll knock off a speaker point, or five, or ten.

I read Ks in high school and think they can be pretty rad when read well, but bad K debating makes me unhappy. That being said, I do think some Ks (cough cough objectivism) are pretty terrible and you will have an uphill battle convincing me to vote on it.

Speed is fine but I’ve been in college for a while so be clear. If you’re not clear, I’ll yell clear at you.

But if you decide to read politics, you’ll need to go much slower than you will on other flows. This is true for both your shell 
and on the line by line.

For both theory and T— if you want to talk about abuse be specific to this round. I am not compelled by the possibility that the other team might have potentially had a chance to abuse you sets a precedent for all of debate ever.

Clash makes for great debates. Otherwise, I’ll make the arguments interact and you probably won’t like how I do it.

Ditto for argument analysis. Tell me what they cards say and what that means in terms of what’s happening in round, otherwise I’ll do it for you.
