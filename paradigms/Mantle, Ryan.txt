  My name is Ryan. I debated in Oklahoma and placed in the Top 4 at our state tournament in 2013.
1. I am very traditional LD judge.
2. Values and Criteria are a must. 
3. No critiques.
4. Cards are good but without impacts that are just words on paper.
5. This is a speaking event. I only flow what I can understand. 
6. I use the flow to determine the winner.
7. Debaters must provide clash.
8. Good luck. We're all counting on you.
