  Hi,

For some background, I debated four years in high school in the Flint Hills of Kansas. I am fine with any argument, and can take speed, just make sure you make it clear when you are changing flows.

I'm Tabula Rasa, default policy-maker. You can frame the round however you want and I will do my best to follow. I generally consider Theory a question of fairness, so it will be difficult to convince me vote on T without demonstrating at least potential abuse. On all Theory except T, Specs, and Condo, I will default to rejecting the argument and not the team unless you explicitly flesh out an argument to reject the team. Please be nice in cross-ex.

If you have more questions, I would be happy to answer them before the round.
