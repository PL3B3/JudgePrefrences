  Have been judging PFD for 3 years.

Want logical arguements with clear case. Substantiate the impact of your statistics and figures. 
Restating an argument verbatim does not count as a response to your opponents rebutal.
Don't be abusive. Follow the rules of PFD.
Sarcasm and belittlement of your oponent will get you less reward than clear, intelligent rebutal.
