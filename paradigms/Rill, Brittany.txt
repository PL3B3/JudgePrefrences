  I debated for Stoneman Douglas in High school. I dabbled in Debate in College and Now I judge and volunteer with the UDL of Boston.

My Judging Preferences:


- I always look for a link back to the resolution, that is why we are here is to debate the resolution.
- make sure you extend your arguments throughout the round- I use my flow to determine the round with contentions and if you drop one I won't count it in making a decision. 

- I don't mind if you spread, but don't spread just to do it. I would rather you talk normal and have two or three valid reasons to compete with instead of have six or seven weak arguments that you spread through.
If you do choose to spread and I can't understand you then I will yell clear. If I yell clear I might miss what you say therefore not getting it on the flow.


- I'm basically here just to hear what you have to say. I don't want to have to look at the flow and ask for the cards after the round because that kind of defeats the purpose of you debating. If I wanted to just read cards, i'd stay home and do just that. I will however ask for cards if I can't understand the whole thing while spreading so make sure that you have the correct cards that you are actually using should I actually need them.

- tell me what i am voting for, make sure you answer all arguments your opponent brings up or they win that argument.

- I don't really care how you debate or what type of case you decide to use. I think that you debate the way you know and that makes for a better round. I don't like when someone changes there case to fit a judge. Do what you feel comfortable with.

HAVE FUN AND BE NICE TO YOUR OPPONENT.
