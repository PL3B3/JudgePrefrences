  I have been a high school policy debater for 2 years. This year I have judged at Big Lex and other Massachusetts regional tournaments. Iâ€™m not a fan of theory debates, but I will vote on topicality. If you choose to run a kritque please be clear on your advocacy. I enjoy hearing good impact calculus and I do not enjoy debates with unnecessary spreading.
