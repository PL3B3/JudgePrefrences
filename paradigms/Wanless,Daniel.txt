Speed
I am new to LD so don't go full out but you can go faster than conversational. IF TOC is a 10 I am probably able to flow about a 6 or 7.
Theory
I am a reasonablity judge and need to see a clear violation in order to vote on theory.
K
I am well versed in continental philosophy but that still means you have to explain what ever position you are running and why it matters.
