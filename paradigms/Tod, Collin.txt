  I am Collin Tod, I debated LD debate for four years for the Newtown High School Debate team. I was in varsity for the last 3 of those years.
Speed: I am fine with speed as long as it does not interfere with the clarity of the argument. If you start to become unclear I will give you two warnings, but from then on I will not flow what I can't understand.Theory: I will not vote on frivolous theory. You must show me that an abuse did take place and that you can't have a fair debate anymore. If the theory is run simply to avoid clash on case I will most likely not vote for itKritik: I am a big fan of well structured and well thought out Ks. However, like theory, I will not vote on a K that has been run soley to avoid case clash because you can't think of a good argument. A good K must have a very strong link, if the opponent doesn't bite into it then it's gonna be hard to vote on. A good K will probably earn decent speaks.
Value Framework: I am fine with pretty much any framework so long as there's no abuse, give me a clear reason to vote using your FW over your opponent's.Civility: If you are a jerk in your speeches you will receive abysmal speaks, end of story.
I give oral criticism in after round if time allows, and will type up an RFD as well
