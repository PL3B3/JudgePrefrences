  I debated for Jenks High School for 2 years (and for a year on the national circuit). I am now a sophomore at Harvard University.

I highly favor the "value" aspect of LD debate. I enjoy value/criterion driven debates, as well as arguments that have strong philosophical implications. However, as far as voting is concerned, I will only vote on what you tell me to vote on. I will vote on pretty much anything, as long as it is well-warranted and fits in your philosophical framework. If you can beat your opponent's case by pure theory, you will win the round, but remember to _tell_ me that you have done so.

As far as speed is concerned, I will yell "clear" if you are going too fast. Usually I can handle a decent amount of spreading, but please make it so that I can still flow the round. If anything is still unclear, please ask for clarifications on my judging paradigm before the round.
