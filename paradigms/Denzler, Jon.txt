  I believe that paradigms too often focus the debate to the interests or expectations of judges in a way that undermines the novelty of CX debate. Instead my paradigm is that I do not have a paradigm. If I have to name what how I view the CX debate space it is as a tabula rasa judge, and therefore I will listen to any argument. I judge/evaluate clash based on the paradigms that are proposed within the round.

This should not be taken as someone who does not "know" CX debate, but rather as someone open to a wide range of options. I have spent 12 years as a CX debate, coach, and judge.

All further questions can be answered prior to the round in person.
