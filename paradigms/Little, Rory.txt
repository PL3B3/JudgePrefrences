  We all know the muffin man, and so we all know me. I am your typical muffin judge.

Basically, do what you want as long as what you want is what is want and not need.

A couple LITTLE picture things:
1. Kritik's (i'm not sure what a critique is, and hate it when people pronounce it that way).

Things I think are great: US-EU relations impacts, Giroux, Dispositionality, ASPEC,

Things I think are good: Khalilizad, Bearden, OSPEC, Consult EU, Jazz, Consult Japan

Things i'm in the middle about: Education, the holocaust, race to the middle's, when people say "extend" (that's a debate to be had), technology, fire, flowing, Zimmerman, acronyms

Things I think are bad: Taiwan-China war, Thayer, economic growth, when people give off-time road maps, uniqueness, limits claims, pen flips, the work "puke," ground

Thinks I think are holocaustal: Jokes about Jack Mcgougan's radio show (KUPS 9-10 pm sundays, it'll change your life), Jews (getit?), tonality


LET ME TELL YOU BOUT MY LIFE LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I CAME FROM LET ME TELL YOU WHERE I AM LET ME TELL YOU WHERE'S IVE BEAN
i WAS born to Frank and Selena Little. They were big.
I was raised by a pack of wolves and a great man named Trevor Fay.
I lived the ages of 5-11 in a marsh.
I have designed video games.
I am judging for my sons debate team. I am kind of a parent judge, I just don't have any kids.
Be nice, be clear, be funny, dont cheat. Tell me where the hell to flow stuff, if i don't know then i will make a guess and not do any work on the flow for you at the end of the debate. I like to mathematically calculate the debate round like it is a computer game. That is why I flow in a graphing calculator.
