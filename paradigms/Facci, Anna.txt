  I debated competitively in Oklahoma from 2005-2008. 
1. I flow.
2. I use the flow to determine the winner.
3. I believe this is still a speaking event and that spreading is not good for this activity.
4. Philosophy, evidence, and impact analysis are all necessary to win my ballot.
5. I'm a big fan of being nice.
6. Cards are good, but they don't prove anything by themselves.
