  I am a "parent judge" and this is my second year judging Lincoln Douglas debate. I prefer debaters not to spread, though speed is fine if arguments are clear. I also prefer debaters not to run theory or Ks. Polite, prepared, and organized debaters impress me, while overly emotional and illogical ones do not. Debaters who listen to their opponents' arguments carefully and are capable of refuting on the spot impress me most.
