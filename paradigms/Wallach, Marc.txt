  I debated for four years for Collegiate (NY), and am now a student at Yale. I received bids to the TOC from both regional and national tournaments my Senior year, and coached at Session 2 of the Victory Briefs Institute this past summer. I now coach students from Newtown (CT) and Millburn.

I'll generally vote based on the flow, and I look to a truth-testing paradigm to determine who wins the round, unless any other adjudicative standard (i.e. comparative worlds) is established. I don't think I have a great understanding of theory, but will vote on it if you're clearly winning the violation, standards, and voters. I'm decent, but not great, at flowing speed, and will tell you to be clear if you're going too fast for me. I'll only start docking speaks if I have to say clear for speed multiple times. Other caveats: I think I understand most arguments, but will only vote on them when I understand the argument and how it functions. Also, you must fully re-extend arguments throughout your speeches for them to carry weight. Finally, I'll give higher speaks for rounds I find interesting, and will tend to give lower speaks if I find you really repetitive.
