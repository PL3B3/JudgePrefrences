  In high school I was in Speech for one year. For the last year and a half I have judged PF, LD, and Speech.

For both PF and LD:
I prefer the traditional form of both debates: strong arguments, strong evidence, reasonable speaking speed.If you decide to spread I have one rule: do it right or don't do it at all. I prefer you don't for the sake of your opponent however. If your opponent agrees to it then I have no qualms, just make your taglines clear.I flowI don't mind terminology. If I am unfamiliar with a term I will ask after the roundIf you are using a computer (and see that I am as well) please flash me your cases, I will delete your files from my computer at the end of the round.Do not become petty about who is not supposed to run what, it detracts from your argument validity and is irritating.Explain. Explain explain explain explain. Don't just make a claim without support.Roadmaps are greatly appreciated :)Please recount the key voter issues/make it clear who won during the final rebuttals/focus.Most importantly! Be respectful. We're here to have a good productive time and want everyone to come back for tournaments to come.
For PF:
Be wary of overshadowing your partner, work together.
Greatest impact and effective argumentation is typically how I judge.

For LD:
I do not mind how the case is structured so long as it applies to the topic and develops an effective argument. (If you decide to run theory it better be applicable, however please note I am still unfamiliar with them)
I judge on framework.

Best of luck!
