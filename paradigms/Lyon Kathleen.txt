  I like debaters to have clear communication (spreading is mostly or usually unnecessary) , good evidence and examples, to acknowledge and address the opposition if there is merit to it, and to be civil during their rounds and respectful during othersâ€™ rounds. I am traditional, NOT progressive. I want to see traditional debate and not a bunch of theory games. If you are not going to provide that for me to evaluate the round. I do not feel that I could evaluate the round properly or vote for you. I tend to vote on who is doing the best job overall, rather than small technicalities or dropped arguments that don't seem to me like they focus on the main question being asked in the resolution. The value debate is a very important part of the debate for me. Debaters may lose a "contention" for me, but still win the debate if they win the value debate. Clash is central to BOTH sides of the debate. I do consider meaningful cross examination in my decision. If you do your best and treat your opponent with respect, you will get the same treatment from me in return!
