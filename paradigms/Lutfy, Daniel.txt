I'm gonna be a minimalist. I'm not gonna call for evidence. I'm not gonna say clear. If I don't understand something then I'm not voting for it; it doesn't matter if it's 100 percent conceded. If an implication of a skep trigger is not in the original speech, then it can be responded to after you make the new argument. Speed is fine. I don't care what your arguments are, just make them good.
