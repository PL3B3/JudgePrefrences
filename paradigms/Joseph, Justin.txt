  About the Round:

While making a decision, I want to interject as few of my opinions as humanly possible. 

A winning debater will have established a weighing standard and successfully warranted how he/she has best met that standard. Alternative arguments (theory/etc) are fine, but I'll only vote on it if a VERY clear decision making calculus is given. 

Speed is tolerated, but discouraged. I'll try to keep up, but the onus is on the debater to make sure I've gotten the information. I will give fairly obvious non-verbal signals if I don't follow. Slow down when you read an author's name. I DO NOT call for cards after the round and DO NOT expect me to. Just deliver the evidence clearly. 

*In rebuttal, do not try to "extend" an argument by merely referencing an author's name without giving analysis! Voters can be down the flow or at the end. Cross applications must be made VERY clearly. I don't mind if you ask each other questions during CX (if neither the tournament nor your opponent objects).

One opinion I do have is that the burden of persuasion is on the affirmative to prove the truth of the resolution. In the event that doesn't happen, I will vote negative by default. This opinion will be set aside if the debaters tell me in round why some other assumption should be made. 


About Me:

I debated at RL Turner from 2000-2004. (TOC: 2003/2004; Nationals: 2004; TFA State 2002/2003/2004) Although I've judged a bit after I graduated, I haven't done so recently (within the last year). I just graduated from law school, took the Texas Bar Exam, and am currently working as a technical writer. Feel free to ask me any questions.
