General: 

You do you. I don't have any preference for certain kinds of arguments, but my experience lies more in the direction of critical than policy arguments if that's any help. If you do what you do well, you should be just fine. 

I like to believe I have a decent threshold for speed. If you're too fast/unclear for me, I will call out clear as needed.
