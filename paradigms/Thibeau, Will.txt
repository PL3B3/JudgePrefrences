Das: read them. 
CPs: good. 
T: yeah. 
K: If you must. 
 
I understand that might be frustrating to some, but the above comments are as useful as any paragraph long theoretical rant I could give.  
 
I debated at a very competitive level on the national circuit in high school. Although I don’t debate in college, I will be able to handle any level (within reason) of speed-reading.  
 
This will probably be the most important thing about me: when I debated I was the 2N, and went for the politics DA and case arguments or a CP in 95% of my 2NRs. Obviously, that’s the kind of debate I want to see.  
That being said, I am VERY sympathetic to intrinsicness arguments made on the aff (but only intrinsicness). Very few neg teams know how to sufficiently answer the argument and it is most likely true. 
 
With regards to other theory issues, I have a slightly more than slight neg leaning, but not enough of a predisposition where it is useless to read theory in the 2AC.  
 


 
I will do everything I can to vote against teams that pursue drastically alternative frameworks. Sadly, in the past, I’ve found most teams unable to effectively rebut such a strategy (whether on the aff or neg).
