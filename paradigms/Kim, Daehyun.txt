Do what you're best at. Be a decent person and have fun.

Background:

Debated 4 years for Lexington High School

Currently a freshman debating at Dartmouth College, tentatively majoring in Government.

I spent the first half of high school reading traditional arguments, and spent the latter half reading kritikal args. I've been ideologically flexible in college so far. You shouldn't assume I have a particularly deep background in any literature when you explain arguments. 

I think that I have a slightly higher threshold for voting on theory due to my relative lack of experience debating it, so make sure to impact arguments clearly.

A new argument is one that could not have been predictably deduced from my understanding of its previous form.
