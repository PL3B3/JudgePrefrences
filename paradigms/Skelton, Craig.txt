Background
I debated public forum for three years at Fayette County High School (GA). After graduating, I returned to Fayette County for three years where I coached public forum and Lincoln Douglas debaters. I have been judging on the Georgia LD/PF circuit for the last four years. This year I have judged 15-20 rounds in LD and Public Forum.

Philosophy

I want the debate the cleanest and most efficient as possible. How you get there is your choice. I'd rather you give me clear and concise arguments rather than a slew of arguments. I probably lean away from the kritikal literature in debate and therefore would like some type of decision calculus given in the last speeches. I'm very flexible with the debate-- main thing is to enjoy the activity, and let me enjoy it in return.

Feel free to ask me any specific questions before the round.
