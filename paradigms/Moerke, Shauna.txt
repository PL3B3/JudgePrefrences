  I debated for Lakeville a while back, and have been judging for them for at least 5 years. I like an organized debate and absolutely hate when either debater is disrespectful and will tell you that if I think you are being disrespectful. I am pretty good with speed, but do not go fast just top go fast, have some type of purpose. I am not a big fan of Ks or theory, but if you do a good job explaining them and show why they work in the round and resolution, I will look at it. In the end, I look to the value and the criterion and who best upholds the standards. I want debaters to impact clearly and concisely. Debaters should use evidence and should warrant the use of evidence. I am a nice person, and just want to judge the round without having to interfere. Ask me any questions to clarify my paradigm before the round.
