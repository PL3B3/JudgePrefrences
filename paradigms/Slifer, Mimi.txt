RE: Judges Philosophy for Lincoln-Douglas Debate

I judge based on the evidence and argumentation presented during the debate. I will conclude a winner of the debate based on the arguments that coherently link and are clearly evidenced. I use my flow from the round to make the decision and provide constructive criticism to aid debaters in improving their craft. The structure of how the evidence presented does not factor into my judgment as long as the structure does not deteriorate the arguments and their contentions. I maintain an open viewpoint of the arguments, but will evaluate on how persuasive the argument is and how it impacts the opponents arguments.

I will not vote for any argument that I do not understand and is without logic. Debaters can and should use complicated arguments, contentions or philosophies to debate, but those should be thoroughly explained.

Debaters should bear in mind that speed can critically impact my flow. If speed is too fast that I cannot logically flow the argument, then speed can harm. A brisk pace is fine as long as the arguments and contentions presented have clarity and enunciation does not degrade. Speed does not make an argument more intense and may only serve to argue many contentions instead of a few well thought out and thorough reasons. Arguments should be substantive instead of fast.

Finally, I do not interfere in rounds. Just saying your opponentâ€™s argument is invalid is not enough to win the round, but must be clearly proven. Also rudeness in a round toward an opponent does leave a negative impression. While, as a judge, I will not interfere, but the argument may become invalidated if the only thing that is used to prove the contentions is based on rudeness instead of actual, concise, and clear reasoning.
