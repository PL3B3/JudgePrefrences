  I view myself as a tab's judge in so far as I expect the debaters to frame the debate for me. In other words tell me where to vote and why to vote there. I do not come into the round with a belief in stock issues; if you are going to run an issue as a stock issue, I expect excellent framework to back up this assumption. In judging a round, I prefer that both teams run framework arguments to help frame the debate: a lack of framework leaves the round open to judge bias and intervention. Kritiks, kritikal affs, and theory are all fine and encouraged. I will never vote you down based on the type of argument you are running as long as it is run well. Speaker points are awarded based on clarity, but more importantly on who provides the best in-round analysis.
