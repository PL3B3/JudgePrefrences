  I debated for a year in college (2011-2012). I am OK with speed if you are going toofast iI just say clear. If you run t, k, or any other specs they better be good. I dont like taking jabs at others during round, but it is debate and things can get heated i just ask that you try to be nice. I love a good debate so have fun and good luck. Other than that I say convince my why you are right in your stance.
