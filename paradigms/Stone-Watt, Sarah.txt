 Rounds on Topic: 8

I like teams who are nice to everyone in the round and who tell me why they think they are winning the debate. I will vote on almost anything so long as it is well articulated and explained (and you are winning it). I have a low tolerance for teams that are only fast when they are unclear and I will make attempts to warn you if I can't understand what you are saying. I also have a low tolerance for blippy, unexplained, T and theory debates. If you are making theoretical arguments please offer warrants for your argument and don't just say things like "fairness" or "education" and expect me to fill in the rest. Additionally, I like critiques but that does not mean that I am as deep on your specific critique literature as you are. I think it is your job to fully explain the argument in a coherent manner. I am happy to answer any other questions you have so don't hesitate to ask me.
