  Several years of judging experience. 

Lincoln Douglas: I look for value class in the round, but this clash is shaped by how both sides develop and defend their frameworks. It is difficult for either side to win with defensive arguments, so I tend to side on debates that go beyond simple contention blocks and defense. While evidence is not required, a well-constructed and impact-grounded set of contentions can illustrate the value-debate effectively. That being said, contentions without impacts need not be said at all.

Speed: Moderate. Enunciation is important. If I can't understand it, I won't flow it.
