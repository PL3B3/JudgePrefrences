  Hello,

I am a lay parent judge with no background in fast debate. I have judged for three years in slow debate only. I do not understand spreading, and if you spread, you will most likely lose the round and also receive poor speaker points. Remember: debate is an activity about communication and speaking to both your opponents and your judge. If I do not understand what you are saying, then you are not communicating with me. 

I go by a traditional, stock issues paradigm. I will most likely not call for evidence after a round. If you want to go fast, you would probably be best off striking me/giving me a 5. 

In a similar vein, because I do not have fast experience, I am not well versed in philosophy or critical theory, and will likely not be able to evaluate or understand your kritiks in the round. Please do not run kritiks.
