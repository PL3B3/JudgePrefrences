  If you care enough about my preferences to be looking at this, I expect that you WILL CHANGE your tactics if something I say interferes with your notorious off-k plots.

SPEED:
At high speeds, substance tends to diminish and I usually simply flow taglines at this point. Because of this, if you plan to speak fast, make sure your taglines are CLEAR. If I think speed is more related to you winning than your logical analysis skills (i.e. your opponent dropped some things because he didn't catch them/there was too much for him to hit) I will usually value clashing arguments more than dropped ones. Also, this is a PUBLIC SPEAKING event. The best debaters sound convincing as well as being convincing. 

THEORY:
Why would you ever run theory? Sure it works, and is hard to counter, but I think it destroys the fundamental idea of what debate is. I will flow theory, but I will always value good topical analysis over it. Make sure that if you plan on running something that isn't a "standard" case, it better be damn good.

Speaker points based on actual speaking prowess. The logic decides the RFD and the speech decides the points. I have no problem giving out low-point wins. Clear, non-stuttering, minimal pauses, eye contact, emphasis, variance, and nervous tics all come into account here.
