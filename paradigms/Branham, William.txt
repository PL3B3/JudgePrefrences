  Experience:
I have done policy debate for 6 years - 3 in high school and 3 in college for USC. 
I have not judged very many debates on this topic, so keep that in mind.

Philosophy: 
Generally, I will try to be as tab as possible (but recognize that I can't get rid of all my biases). I have less experience reading the more dense critical literature, but I will do my best to understand and fairly evaluate your argument. Basically, run whatever arguments that you came to the tournament to run and don't change your A strat based on me. 

On theory, I won't vote on cheap shots... you have to put the work in.

Ask me before the round if you have more specific concerns.
