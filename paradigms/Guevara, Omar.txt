Judge Philosophy, 2012-2013:


1. Things I will do:

 A. I flow with a pen on paper and in columns.

 B. Give you my undivided attention when you debate.

 C. Keep the debate on time.

 D. Keep to a minimum the amount of evidence I will read post-round.

 E. View academic debate as a highly competitive co-curricular game.

2. In a Policy v. K round, here are my defaults:

 A. “Germaneness” has to be offensively justified – resolutionary research is required 

 B. A call to reform/reconstruct/transform the Polis seems like a fair balance point.

 C. Policy debate is not intrinsically reactionary.

 D. Specific, warranted, topic-education arguments will be given special consideration.

 E. If you are blippy and abbreviated, I will not flow you. Slow down on theory.

3.  In a K v. K round, here are my defaults:

 A. I am an atypical K critic – I enjoy a wide variety of critical discussion. 

 B. I like my K debates to be radical in substance and traditional in form.

 C. How the ballot is framed is critical. You must make this very clear.

 D. Pick the K that generates the most competition with their K - regardless the flavor.

 E. Yes, I’ve read (most) of your authors. 26 years in the game will do that to you. 

 1. But do explain the link competition stories at the top of the 2NC

 2. Make clear the point(s) of competition in the k-qua-k discussion

4.  In a policy v. policy round, here are my defaults:

 A. Your plan best not have any flaws. It needs to have been in final version

 B. You must be topical. And yes, I am old enough to remember jurisdiction.

 C. You should flaunt the strength of your research. I like author advocates.

 D. U.S.F.G. allows the option of the Courts on the AFF. I love discussions about the law.

 E. Yes, I’ve likely read your literature. I still cut a lot of cards, much of it policy-oriented.


5. Speaker points:

 A. Like when I teach, I grade primarily for effort and not just for demonstrated skill.

 B. However, the effort in question is rather substantial but well rewarded:

 1. Good volume and projection.

 2. CLARITY – every word, every time. NO exceptions.

 3. Poise and presence (includes standing for all speeches).

 4. Professional with partner and opponents.

 5. Keeping on the clock.

 6. Demonstrating particular sensitivity to cross-examination (I flow it)

 7. Showing me you can demonstrate grace under pressure.

 8. Going “off the flow” in a damning rhetorical moment.
