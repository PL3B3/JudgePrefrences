LD Paradigm

I debated three years in high school and have coached LD for the past five years.

I am looking for clear and concise arguments that are value based. LD is a values debate and as such, arguments made should be supported using logic and reasoning. If you are going to use philosophical arguments make sure you understand the philosophy and explain how it applies to your claim and value. 

I do flow the debate and look at dropped points. Debate is a speaking event so presentation is important. I do not mind speed as long as students enunciate and can be clearly understood. Don't tell me to cross apply points from your case to attack your opponents. Explain how your attack or argument relates to the issue. Please do not use policy jargon such as 'card' or 'DA'. I absolutely think a good debater will present disadvantages but call them disadvantages or harms.

Overall I want to see good clash and a values based debate. If you drop your value you lose the round.
