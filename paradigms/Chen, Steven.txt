  I did Policy for 4 years in high school at La Cueva and Dougherty Valley High School, and I mostly ran policy AFFs and CPs and DAs. That doesn’t mean I won’t vote on Ks, but I’m more likely to know about the legislation in your Politics DA than the literature on your Kritik--i.e., if you run a K, make sure you explain the general idea of the K, either as an overview or analytics after your cards. I’m not the most well-read on K lit and if it’s hard to understand your kritik, then it’s going to be hard to vote on it. I have a reasonable threshold for theory, but you need to devote time on it and your analytics have to be more extensive than “time skew, CP and K arguments disappear instantly if Neg doesn’t go for it”. Performance AFFs are also OK with me, although be warned that you’ll have to explain it in depth or I might misunderstand what you’re actually arguing. Lastly, in terms of speed, I prefer slower debates and would rather have you read two-off and on case at a fast speaking pace (not yet spreading) than five-off. That being said, you are welcome to speak as fast as you want, but if I can’t understand you or hear you, I can’t vote on your argument. Slow and deliberate speaking will win you a lot of speaker points and a higher chance that I don’t miss anything you’re arguing.
