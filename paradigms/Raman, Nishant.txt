I debated in CX for 2 years and debated in PF for 1 year.

My experience in judging is only judging one novice CX round and one novice PF round for my high school's debate tournament, so please keep that in mind. 

My decision in a round will be based off logic and the flow of the argument. I am definitely looking for quality over quantity. For debaters who decide to speed through cards, make sure you are clear. I will only say "clear" twice, and after that my decision will be based on what I can understand from your argument. 

To me cross examination is very important, and I will consider it for speaks and use it if I need to while making my decision. Make sure if you bring up a point during cross examination you include it in your speech, otherwise I will not be able to count that point for the actual round. 

Lastly, please be considerate to your opponents.
