 I did Policy Debate for two years at Bingham High School. I have not seen many debates on the topic but that does not mean you have to treat me like a mommy judge. I love a good CP/DA debate, and I ran a lot of T when I debated. I never ran a K but if you run it I can evaluate it. 
  
 Topicality: I ran a lot of T in High School and I vote on any dropped voters. If you go for T you need to make sure you spend enough time on it in the Block.
  
 Disads: Specifics are the best kind
  
 Counterplans: As said before I like a quality CP that is specific. I like to see well constructed CP that test the limit of creativity. 
  
 Kritiks: I am not a true fan of the K but I understand that sometimes it is the best option. If you run a K I prefer you spend a lot of time on the Framework and Alternative, be creative with what you run. In my opinion, the difference between a good and a great K debater is their ability to be creative, funny, and accessible. Give me a few choice metaphors/analogies/etc. and I will enjoy the debate a lot more.
  
 Theory: It is fun to run and fun to listen to. That being said the debate will go better if you can get away from your standard blocks and show that you know how to debate and how debate should be. 
  
 Enjoy the debate, but make sure you are nice and have fun.
