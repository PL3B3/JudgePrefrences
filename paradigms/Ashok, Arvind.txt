  Experience: 4 years CX at Round Rock High School

I've only judged once on the topic this year, so please explain all topic-specific jargon.
I ran both policy and K arguments in high school (probably more K arguments) and I'll vote on either one. That being said, I'm not very well-versed in K-lit beyond the Cap K, so please explain your K to me without being overly reliant on buzzwords - I probably won't know what they mean.
Speed is fine, but if you are reading a Topicality/Framework argument with lots of subpoints, PLEASE slow down so I can flow them properly. Spreading through dense blocks without knowing what you mean is no fun for anyone.
Thoughts on Specific Arguments:
K-Affs: Defend a specific method and you should be goodK's - I will vote on these if they are explained properly.Perms - If you are perming a K and you say "perm do both" try to explain how the perm actually functions in the debate.CP's - good. slow down when you read the CP text.DA's - good. Do impact calculus.T/ Theory - I have a high threshold for voting on these arguments. Don't go for a bunch of ticky-tack violations in the 2NR. I tend to lean towards competing interpretations but I can persuaded towards reasonability. A winning 2NR on this issue focuses in on a few very good arguments.Performance - I have no experience with these affs. I may not be the best judge for it, but I'm certainly not opposed to voting for it. You do you.
Don't be rude and/or offensive please!
