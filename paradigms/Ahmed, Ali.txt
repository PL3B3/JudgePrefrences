  While I am a flow judge I do require that debaters do not spread and keep the debate organized preferably with signposting. Even if I fundamentally disagree with an argument I will believe what you tell me because it is the purpose of the round to determine what is true and what is not and your jobs as debaters to convince me what to believe. Giving reasons especially in weighing is crucial as I will not assign any more importance to any argument unless you tell me to and with it a reason. Use crossfires wisely however if you are rude or degrading to your opponents you will be negatively judged.
