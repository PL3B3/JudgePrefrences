  I debated for Edina High School for four years and graduated in 2006. I now coach Ridge in New Jersey.

My paradigm has changed a bit over the last few years and it changes over the course of individual tournaments as I get sick of watching things. But a few notes:

1. Theory isn't fun. I'm not voting on it anymore when it is run in regards to interpretive issues (theory on academic dishonesty and the like are still fair game - but don't abuse this or I'll be unhappy).
2. I am not anti-RVI.
3. I can flow speed fine, but I usually think that debaters speak too quietly when they go quickly and that at a certain point, substance begins to get lost - so I don't like it when you blaze through a critical position).
4. I have decided to steal Jane Kessner's paradigmatic decision to presume based on whose cross-examination is better (in absence of in-round argumentation).

Ask me other questions before the round and maybe I'll put them in here. For example, every single Scarsdale debater at Yale asked me about RVIs. Thus it is now in my paradigm.
