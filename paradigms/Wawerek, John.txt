Lincoln Douglas Debate Judge Philosophy
I am currently an assistant debate coach for a high school with a small LD squad. Our team competes
primarily in PF, but I have judged LD for the past 2 years.
I have judged LD rounds this year at local tournaments and have judged rounds in PF at the UF Blue Key
Tournament and Congress at the Harvard Tournament.
My preferred rate of delivery is moderate speed because I judge based upon the V and VC but with
strong consideration of the argument contentions therein. I can take speed if the speaker is clear, but I
will only consider what I understand. I feel it is the obligation of each debater to build a clear and
understandable case rather than expecting the judge to figure it out.
Criterion is important to my decision since it is the distinguishing characteristic of Lincoln-Douglas
debate, but argument points must fit the selected criterion and the criterion should be the overarching
goal of the argument points.
I am fine with commonly used debate jargon when it is used correctly and not used as a filler.
I believe that final rebuttals should include both line by line analysis voting issues.
I decide the winner of the round on the basis of best and most arguments within the established criteria.
I consider both analytical and empirical evidence in the round.
When I judge a round, I flow in order to reach a decision and award the win as noted above.
