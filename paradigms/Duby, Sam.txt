3rd Place TOC '03
Coached at Northland 2007-2011 won a bunch of stuff
Now I'm 30 work at a bank have a wife and a cat. 


I didn't flow much when I debated judged or coached so can't imagine that's changing this weekend


Aaron Timmons taught me pretty much everything I know about debate. If you like him judging you, I'm probably a good judge for you. 

I think the AFF needs to explain why the world is better (however you define that) with a living wage and then the negative gets to have a competing advocacy. 

Feel free to ask as many questions as you want before the round.
Feel free to ask as many questions as you want after round.
