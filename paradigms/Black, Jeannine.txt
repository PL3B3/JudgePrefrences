  Black, Jeannine

Educator with several years' judging experience in LD, mostly at the local level.

Can handle highly complex argumentation IF accompanied by sound research, analysis, and explanation.

DEBATERS WILL BE PENALIZED IF THEY:
- speak at an unintelligible speed. (Do not speak at National Circuit norms; use a pace more appropriate for a classroom presentation.)

- do not show opponents the proper courtesy and respect. Extreme levels of aggression -- in speeches, cross-examination, or at any point during the round -- will result in penalties.
