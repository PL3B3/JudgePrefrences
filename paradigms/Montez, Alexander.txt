Judgment information:
Without going into a ramble I like judging a debate based upon the evidence brought to the table and who refuted the oppositions claims more effectively. I like seeing the impact of a
point and making sure the debater tells me what he wants me to write. I judge philosophically and like to look at a debate outside the box. My overall opinion on my judgement is that
I look for not only the stronger evidence but the debater that places more effort into their case.
