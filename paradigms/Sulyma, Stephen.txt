  I consider myself an impact judge. I want to see what are going to be the results of the actions your taking. Unless told how to weigh impacts I will do so on a utilitarian scale, in which I tend to favor economic and environmental advantages heavier than political or social. I'm much more interested in the effects that your plan will have rather than how well you may have debated. I do not consider myself very "gamey" and tricks in debate that detract from what you're trying to push through will not weigh as heavily as a well structured ad/disad with impacts. 

I am ok if you want to talk as fast as you like, but I'm not a fan of spreading. I would much rather you have 2-3, advantages than listing off half a dozen or more. I am pretty harsh on dropped issues and will factor those heavily into my final decision.

I also tend to give out pretty high speaks, usually in the 28-24 range, reserving anything higher for speakers who really stand out in a round.
