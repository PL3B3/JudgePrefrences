  C. LEON KING HIGH SCHOOL

I am the parent of a current high school debater, I am open to listen to most positions you would want to run that being said, i am a lay judge so please do not spread or run very complicated cases with me. I will start giving speaker points at 28 and I will go up or down according to how well you articulate your case.
