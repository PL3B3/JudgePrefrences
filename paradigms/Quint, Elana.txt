  Experience: 
I competed in LD all 4 years in high school. I now compete in college policy. I also teach at VBI in the summers and coach students throughout the season. 

From me to you:
Invest in the process, not in the outcome.
Always do your best. 
Remember to thank the people who gave you the opportunity to compete in this incredible activity. 

How to win my ballot:
Explain how I should evaluate the debate. Where do I go first? What are you winning there? Why are you winning it? The easier you make it for me to fill out my ballot the more likely I am to vote for you. Think of it like this: what you say in the 2NR/2AR should be written out as my RFD.Make sure that you are extending your arguments in every speech. I have a higher threshold for extensions than most judges. This also means taking the time to explain your internal links. Generate offense. Make your arguments matter. Do they link to the framework? The ROB? D-rule?
As for everything else, ask me for specifics. Generally, you are free to argue as you wish so long as you defend it well.
