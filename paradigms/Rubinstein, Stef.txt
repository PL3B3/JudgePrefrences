Did policy freshman year, dabbled in public forum

I would vote on almost any argument, so long as it is clearly articulated as to why your arguments are superior to your opponents, weigh between yours and your opponents arguments to win. I'm not going to do the analysis for one side or the other... I'm also not a huge fan of kritiks, and if you want to go with them you should explain them exceptionally clearly.
