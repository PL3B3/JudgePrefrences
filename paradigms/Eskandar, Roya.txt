  I was a parli debater at Rancho Bernardo High School for four years. I don't like spreading. If I can't understand it, I won't flow it, and consequently, will not vote for it. Please signpost and label your arguments clearly. Poor speaking will result in low speaker points. I will vote for the debater with better and more logical points. Despite my preference for a moderate speed of speaking, speaker points don't play a role in my judging decision.

Additionally, please don't try to fill up time simply by being repetitive. I will call you out on it. I will not vote for arguments that I do not understand, so if you are running more "modern" arguments, explain them clearly. This also applies to more obscure philosophies.

CX is binding. I think that a good CX can be strategically advantageous. Don't just use it as a time to ask clarification questions, but try to poke holes in your opponent's argument. High speaks will be awarded to debaters who use their CX time effectively. 

Extend! However, don't just say "extend x argument across the flow". Extend the argument and reiterate the importance of the extension. I think that this is far more impactful and makes it more obvious why I should vote for you.

Have fun!
