  BACKGROUND IN DEBATE: High School late Sixties--College Southeastern State Durant 71-75 intercollegiate debate four years NDT 1974, Other placings include 3rd Wake Forest 1972, (tie 10th overall speaker) 3rd USC 1974, Quarters Baylor (1974?)

POST COLLEGE Coached CX, LD, on volunteer basis 26 years, (My REAL job is as a trial attorney) 3x State CX champion Oklahoma [[#|Class]] 4A 1X, LD State Champion. Judged lots of rounds. This year (2014-15) not so many.

JUDGING PHILOSOPHY: Primarily concerned with argumentation analytics. I really do not have any biases about the kind of argument (i.e. CP, DA, K, Case, Framework, Topicality) but am greatly concerned with the [[#|application]] of the argument. It is my belief that ANY argument may become paramount in a debate round depending on how is it pursued by the participants. And that is the key to me---the Participants making the argument and [[#|applying]] it by demonstrating how it is important and what it does by way of impacting the opponents' positions.

I like to think that I can handle the spread (because that is what we did in college), but I am very very strict in this sense--if I cannot understand what is being said, I will NOT flow it NOR will I give an oral indication that I am not understanding it. Instead you might observe me put my pencil down or quit typing on my laptop.

As might be understood from the above, I am not much of a fan of generic argumentation. I do not as a general rule think that a generic DA for instance carries as much impact as a case specific DA. Also, impact scenarios in DA argumentation become more meaningful if real world impact as opposed to debate world impact is demonstrated.

Admittedly, I am not as well versed on K argumentation as I would like to be as my knowledge of some philosophers is not as deep as I would like but I find this kind of argument fascinating, and if well developed, I enjoy. I am ok with Cap, Anthropocentrism, Bio, Language K, and the common garden variety--however, if it is something esoteric, I probably have not read it.

CP argumentation is fine. Just set your framework for it clearly.

Also like solvency argumentation when appropriate.

T is ok with me, however, it needs explaining beyond simple words in stds or voters. If education, for instance, is used---please explain and [[#|apply]].

Anything you might want to know in terms of specifics just ask prior to round. I will give you the best [[#|answer]] I can in response.
