  I am a parent judge, so speaking too quickly is probably not the best way to get my ballot. Make sure to speak clearly. I value arguments I can follow logically but other than that I tend to be open to any arguments that you wish to present. I prefer topical arguments but given good reasons to evaluate other arguments, I am open to do so.

Bottom line: justify why I should see the round the way you want me to, and give me a legitimate reason to vote for you.

High speaks are awarded to people with good presentation and clarity. Saying things that are blatantly offensive will tank your speaks.

Have fun!
