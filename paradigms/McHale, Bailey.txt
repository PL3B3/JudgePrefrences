I debated for St. Andrew’s Episcopal School in Mississippi for four years, two years in PF and two years in LD. Now I am a freshman on the UC Berkeley policy team.
General- I evaluate based on what evidence is presented in round. I will not grant you a link or an extension you do not make. That being said, I will not forget history or the news completely when I walk in the room. I am not tabula rasa. I did debate a lot on a traditional circuit, so feel free to go traditional. I want voters, and I want you to weigh. Tell me what you think is important and why. Do not neglect this in your last speech.
CX- Please be kind and respectful to one another. I do not appreciate condescending or rude comments, and I will dock your speaks for a bad cross. 
Speed- I am not great at flowing high speeds. Be clear, and I will warn you to slow down only once. If I can’t understand you, I can’t flow you; so make sure I’m flowing.
Theory- I did not debate theory much in high school, and I don’t know much about it. If you think there is in round abuse and what to spend the time explaining it, then go for it. I will not vote on a 10 second spike. RVIs need in round justifications.
K- I didn’t debate them as much, but I think Ks can be very effective if explained well. Assume I probably haven’t read whatever literature you are relying on and explain it to me. I will not vote on skepticism.
Framework- I actually like framework debate and I expect to be presented with a clear weighing mechanism. If you don’t want me simply to pick, then don’t leave it up to me to make arguments for you.
Performance- I have no experience judging or debating performance, but if that is your best form of debate go for it. Just explain to me how the performance will win you the ballot.
I will drop you for racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. language. 
If you have questions, please ask me before round. 
TL;DR- Make arguments, weigh, and be clear.
