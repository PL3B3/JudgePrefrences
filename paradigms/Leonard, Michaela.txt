  I am a college student now. I debated LD and PF in high school. I weigh quantifiable evidence directly pertaining to the topic more heavily than philosophy, and much more heavily than theory. I prefer a slow to moderate pace- no spreading please! I look for high quality evidence from respectable sources. Keep cross ex civil please, and don't cry abuse for things that are clearly within the rules for LD. Good luck!
