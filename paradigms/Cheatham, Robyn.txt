  I was a policy debater for three years in high school in 2009. It's been a while since I judged PF, but here are some general guidelines.
1. I don't like arrogance, disrespect, or impoliteness. If you are being snooty, disrespectful or unkind, I can guarantee that you will not like what I have to say about your speaking skills. Good debaters can argue without insults or sarcasm.
2. Lay out your arguments simply. If it gets complicated and round-about, I'll probably tune out.
3. Bonus points for making me laugh.
Other than that, good luck!
