Debated for Bronx Science 2010-2014

Pennsbury is my first tournament judging on the surveillance topic.

you can read pretty much anything in front of me. I mostly ran critiques and critical affs ( with and without plans), but I also used to read entirely policy arguments
you can read an aff without a plan but i am willing to vote for framework

Framing arguments is very important like comparing impacts. 

for speed, remember that this is my first time judging in a while so ease into your top speeds and try to slow down a bit especially on theory type stuff. I will try to make it clear if i can't flow you
