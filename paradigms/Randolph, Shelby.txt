  Paradigm: 

I am a pretty policy based judge. I really tend to evaluate the best policy option in the round. I really like to evaluate CPs and DAs. I will listen to K's but I prefer for them to have a real alternative. If you want to take the round in a different direction with a different framework that is fine you just need to lay it out for me and follow through with it. I am fine with theory arguments, but once again really walk me through it because I am not as strong with theory arguments as other things. Basically I will listen to anything, but I need for you to impact it out for me and explain why I evaluate it. 

As for speed I can flow pretty fast, but I really like for you to be clear so I can understand what all you are saying. I will state clear once before I start deducting speaker points. Speaking of speaker points I tend to evaluate both on speaking style and on analysis. I would say I give the edge more towards analysis, but if I cannot understand you then I won't be able to understand your analysis.
