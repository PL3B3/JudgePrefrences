  Debated 3 years of LD at Torrey Pines (2011). Now at UC Berkeley (class of 2015).

In general I'm open to every argument. However I prefer unique and creative arguments. Speed is generally fine, I'll call clear if not.

For theory I'm cool with RVIs, fairness and education are important, fairness is more important. Fairness is always a reason to reject the debater. I default competing interps.

In general I prefer smart analytics to cards.

I don't understand how plans/counterplans function for LD debate.

In terms of ballot, I try to do as little work for you as possible, so make sure your extensions are clear, with clearly explained impacts and weighing.

Don't be a robot and only read off paper.

Flex prep is fine as long as both debaters agree to it before the round.

Random stuff I like:
-Random literary/pop culture/mythological references
-Unique philosophical arguments
-Other creative arguments

If you manage to say "booyah" in each of your speeches, I will up your speaks by 0.5

Overall, I like fun debates. I encourage you to be hilarious in round.

gl hf!

I believe in the cleansing power of the triforce. Debaters should display equal amounts of power, courage, and wisdom.
