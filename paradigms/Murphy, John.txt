Short version:
I’m lay. I’m kinda smart, but it takes me a while to get there. Spread if you want me to vote up your opponent.

Slightly more verbose version:
Arguments:
I’m ok with all types of arguments, in fact I enjoy creative strategies. HOWEVER, explain to me where you are going in layman’s terms (yep, I’m lay). Debate lingo is lost on me; a good argument is not. You may have lived, breathed, ate and shat the topic; I have not. I took philosophy courses back in the prehistoric age in college. So I do have a basis in “kritikal” literature that you may be able to access, but memory fades so remind me.

Speed:
I’d really prefer that you speak at a conversational pace. If time is of the essence, you will have to decide if it is worth it to hit me with quantity or quality (hint: quality usually wins). I will yell clear three times if I need to, but after that I will just set down my pen and take out my kindle.

Speaker Points:
These are earned on cross ex and rebuttal. The best cross ex strategies I have seen will slowly walk the opponent into a corner (no this does not mean obnoxiously interrupting your opponent’s answers or putting words in their mouth). Admissions made in cross ex are binding. I weigh heavily on well-articulated, structured and logical arguments.

+0.5 speaks if you can work in a Frank Zappa or Tom Waits quote.
