  First of all, I’m a lay, parent judge in LD and PF.

 I’ve judged LD at a couple of bid and local tournaments in the past 3 years, so I’m familiar with a lot of jargon, but definitely don’t assume that I know everything.

 Theory, kritiks, disads, and counterplans must be explained. I prefer substance. Don’t spread because I won’t be able to flow you.
