  About me: I debated policy and LD in high school and college. I am a Racial realist, voted for Trump, content with being a sociopath and thrive in capitalism given my finance major. 
Debate views: 
Everything is debatable including whether or not oppression can bare positive results and or is good or bad. 
Tech>truth 
No defaults on theory
Do what ever you want
You should probably have a metric/FW to evaluate impacts and guide the hierarchy of arguments
Probably not the best judge for heavy phil framework rounds. 

LITERALLY FLASHING ANALYTICS IS NOT A THING LEARN TO FLOW If you ask someone to flash you their overview I will laugh and assume flowing incompetence.

 I wear my feelings and opinions on my face and sleeve as well as verbally sometimes. 
There's only so much I can and am willing to type. So I would advise you to just ask me whatever questions you have. 

1. Read and go as fast as you want I only ask that you give me a verbal gesture when transitioning to the next card/argument LITERALLY JUST SAY "AND" OR "NEXT". It makes my flow neater and prevents any mix ups about arguments.

2. ONLY adapt within your skill level. if you are a Trad debater(please strike me) dont go try reading 30 AC spikes and 1ar Ks...you will fail and probably get your ass kicked. KNOW that I can follow you where ever you decide to take the round. I say this because time and time again kids try to become over night tricks and K debaters and end up loosing bubbles and Elims because they aren't debating in their comfort zone.
