  I have been judging LD for about two years and prefer a traditional style. It's a morality debate meant for the people. So, I find the policy vocabulary that has been sneaking into the LD form a bit a annoying. Spreading in LD is also annoying.

Distinguish your value and criteria from the opponents, explain clearly why yours is better. Spend time here.

I have judged Policy, Parli, and others as well and enjoy them. IE rounds are always a kick.

Speak in an organized, well road-signed manner when referring to both your case and your opponent's because I do like to flow. I won't catch everything, but I'll catch more from the clear, well organized side.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Good luck.
