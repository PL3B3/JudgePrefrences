  Hi, I'm Joe Armstrong.
Here are my paradigms:

No speed. If I can't understand you I will not vote for you. 
I like logical arguments, you must have warrants and your arguments must be organized and methodical.
I am not convinced by emotional arguments (pathos), and I will not listen to any pathos driven arguments. 
Be polite to your opponents: debate should be a learning experience, not a battle of shouting during cross examination.
