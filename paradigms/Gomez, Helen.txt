I am fine with any style of debate. I am able to flow all speeds and use my flow to determine the outcome of the debate (instead of the “Truth” in question). 
 
Everything is debatable. That said, you should be comfortable with your arguments and debate your best, regardless of my personal inclinations. Although I ran strictly policy-oriented arguments (CP/DA/ Case), I can be persuaded by a Kritik 
 
 
Preferences: 
T is about competing interpretations.
Best Policy Option is best 
Conditionality is probably good (in moderation) 
Aff needs to defend their plan 
Consult/ Condition/ Process CPs are competitively deficient 
Offense/ Defense Framework 
Theory args are a reason to reject the argument unless explained otherwise 
 
 
I like:
Explanation of arguments 
Impact calculus 
Clarity/ organization on the flow 
 
 
You should have fun, be respectful, debate well. 
Cheaters will lose. Automatically.
