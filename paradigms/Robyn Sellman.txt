  My name is Robyn Sellman. I coach at Coon Rapids High School in Minnesota. 

I like good debate. Make good arguments. Don't mistake quantity for quality. I like good criterion debate. 

Speed is fine. If you're reading something confusing or critical, slow down a little. I don't mind critical arguments, but I am not super familiar with them. I don't prefer to see theory as a strategic device. Therefore, I will only vote on theory if there is clear in-round abuse. I don't find potential abuse entirely persuasive. 

That's pretty much it, if you have specific questions, feel free to ask.
