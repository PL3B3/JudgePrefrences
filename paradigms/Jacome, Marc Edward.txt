  I had a real judge philosophy, but the Michigan Debate team is full of trolls. So I'll make this short. I am a 2nd year debater from Umich and debated for GBS for 4 years. Anyways, I genuinely believe I'd listen to any argument and will ensure any predispositions are irrelevant to a debate I am judging. If you are doing a poor job of explaining/conveying your argument or are unclear, I have no problem ignoring whatever I don't understand. If you have any questions, just ask before the round.
