  Things I like:
Impact Comparisons (Probability, Magnitude, Time-frame, Reversibility)
Even-If Arguments (We will win on x argument: Even if we don't win x argument, we will win the position/debate because of y argument)
Warranted Arguments ( X is true because Y)
Strategic Decision-Making (what to run, and what to go for...)
Knowledgeable Students (impress me with what you know)
Creativity


My background: 
From the Northwest, so maybe a little unknown around these parts. Debated in HS and 4 years at Univ. of Puget Sound. Coached 3 years of college CEDA and NPDA.
