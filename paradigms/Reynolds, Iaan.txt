  I did PF at Eagan HS, and have since judged plenty of it, along with LD and Policy at our district tournament/locals. I am now the head coach of Walt Whitman, and have been an assistant for two years. I have worked at the Harvard Debate summer camp for three years.

PF is getting a lot faster, so you don't have to read especially slowly in front of me. Speed is fine, as long as you are clear. If you are not, I will ask you to be clearer. PLEASE pause after authors, tags, etc. Your job is to make my flow look like your flow, and it's not my fault if it doesn't. If a card is super complicated, I would like you to slow down. Ditto if you're explaining difficult analytics.

I want a way to evaluate the round. I don't want to intervene. I am familiar with Policy arguments and the way they function, and very familiar with value-criterion debate. I like kritiks because I read the authors in school and stuff, but I won't vote for a confusing argument just because you're brave enough to be running it. I only like to vote for anything if it is explained coherently. Make me do the least work, and you win. 

To that end, please weigh.

Theory is fine. Just read it a bit more slowly, since I honestly have a bit less experience with it. If it is well warranted, it'll work out. 

Lastly, please don't be disrespectful to one another. Your speaks will reflect my distaste if you're busy running circles against a freshman, and take a few extra seconds to make them feel stupid. Also, your opponent is there to disagree with you. No reason to seem indignant.
