  I debated Public Forum for Hamilton during high school, and I am now judging policy for BASIS Chandler.

Things I don't like:
-Rudeness: don't debate like Biden. Be polite and respectful to both your opponent and me.
-Spreading without clarity: don't spread unless you can make it clear. I want to be able to distinguish between tags and main evidence.
-Ridiculous links: don't give me outlandish links. Even though this is policy I will not vote on something claiming that taking two steps to the right will cause extinction. I'm more used to sensible arguments.

Things I love and will reward:
-Clear and CONCISE arguments
-Well researched material
-Case specific arguments: generic args are okay, but make them convincing enough to get my ballot.
-Humor: appropriate of course.

Kritiks: Do not debate K's. I do not like them, and will not vote on them. Rather, it will be a reason for me to vote you down.

Topicality:  Iâ€™m more than open to these debates, I have no problem pulling the trigger on them. I tend to evaluate these debates in a framework of competing interpretations. 

Theory: Do not have much experience with this, so do not run it. If you can make it convincing to me, then go ahead. It will most likely not be something that I will vote for you on though.

CP's: Don't debate theory over PIC bad, or International Fiat bad. Exclusively debate on solvency, how the agent can't solve in the case of an Agent CP, etc. In other words, do not debate theory over the counterplan. Show me how you solve better or how the counterplan can't solve. I love PIC's and Consults, but make me buy your argument in order to get my vote. 

DA: Nothing much to say here. I will vote on all kinds of DA's (unless you run something like Elections obviously), and will reward case specific DA's. There may be points where I do not understand your DA completely, so give me a good explanation of it somehow. I need to be able to understand what you're running.

CASE*: Love it, love it, love it.

Extra Notes:
Keep in mind I have never actually debated policy but have been exposed to it. I know what everything is but keep in mind that I'm not a big fan of spreading. 
I will award speaker points based on how clearly you present your arguments and how you utilize a combination of what I reward speaker points for. I will not give lower than a 27 unless I think you have done an extremely bad job. in the debate. But most of all, have fun!
