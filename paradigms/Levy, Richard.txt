  I am a parent judge, I do not like spreading, CP, DA, and theory Shells. I have a great understanding of this topic (Jan-Feb 2017). I prefer traditional LD, and I will typically go for the case that is most reasonable, but if you are able to defend your case very well I might vote for you. Pref me if you are a traditional LD debater.
