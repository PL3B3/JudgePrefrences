 -Explain your god damn arguments.


-Collapse wisely: you're never winning on every sheet. Tell me which arguments don't hold weight in the round 
-Be inclusive to your opponents

-Don't be any -ist (ex. racist, homophobic, sexist, ableist, etc)

-Quality over quantity, but find a balance. I will not give you the ballot because you gave me 6 more responses than the other team that are irrelevant and blipped out. But do not think that one response will transfer over to both disads and sufficiently answer them.

-Use your rebuttals to tell me where to vote, why I should vote there, and how it compares to the other arguments in round. I don't want to do the work for you, because I will vote in unconventional, unnecessary places. 

-Thoery is dope and I am always willing to vote on it if it's structured well and has voters. 

Overview: I want an educational, complex, memorable round. Don't be offensive. If your opponent is being offensive, point it out. 

Speed: Go for it. 

Theory: I loooooooove it, but I don't like to see it done wrong. 

Ks: Marx pls. If you're rejecting the res, explain why you feel that you need to and how you solve. Have decent links and justify the root cause claim and warrant your reasoning. 

Case: Case turns are awesome. Use them. They're super cool.

Rebuttals: Please explain to me clearly about how your arguments function in the round, where you're winning, and why you get to your impacts first, for a longer period of time, or how they're more feasible. 

Clarity: I will vote on arguments if you make them clear to me. I've been in the activity long enough to have heard a fair share of args but that doesn't mean I'm going to do the work for you.

Evidence: I'll call for cards on occasion, don't powertag or take your evidence out of context. Also, I enjoy when people point out the flaws in their opponent's evidence. Finally, give me some analysis of your cards and how the link story functions and interacts with other arguments in the round. I am perfectly fine with analytics if they are warranted, but 1. Don't have an uncarded 1ac/1nc off (unless it's all theory) 2. discredit your opponent's evidence when you can. 

CX: Sass pls.
