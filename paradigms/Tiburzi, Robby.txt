  GENERAL: I'm a student at Columbia University and a graduate of Harrison High School in New York. I debated at Harrison for a year, and have occasionally judged since then.

PREFERENCES: I want to hear a substantive round without theory, tricks, or illogical impacts. Good links are essential, no matter what the argument is. I am okay with critical or non-traditional arguments that clearly link to the topic. BE SLOW AND CLEAR when speaking. I am not the best at flowing, so don't go for tiny, blippy arguments that I may miss. BIG PICTURE is essential. Tell me how you want me to decide the round, and be as clear as possible.
