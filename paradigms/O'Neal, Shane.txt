When adjudicating a round, I evaluate it the way the debaters tell me to. If one debater justifies something as pre-standards I will look there first, if not I start with the burden/standard presented in case.

I will try to evaluate whatever argument you present objectively but I fell like I am more predisposed towards thinking that some arguments are not as likely to win as others. I like strategic, logical argumentation in the round. I think that fairness voters are usually not very strategic, along with generic arguments that could be applied to any resolution.

I will not vote off of arguments that I do not understand.

If you go too fast I will yell clear. I donâ€™t have a problem with speed as a strategic tool in debate.
