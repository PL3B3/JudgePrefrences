  I debated 4 years in high school for Pace Academy and have debated for Dartmouth.
I judged some at camp, but know relatively little about the High school topic

I will try to vote on arguments that teams convince me are important.

I think teams should be flow-able, if I miss an argument or arguments aren't clearly flagged than i will grant the other team a lot of leeway.


Kritics-
The kritic needs to make a coherent story for me to vote on it. I think the way teams frame kritics is very important (this is different than framework). I am not very familiar with a lot of K literature so chances are you will have to explain it, but I have voted for the K atleast as many times as I have voted against it.

Theory-
I actually like theory debates, but teams should slow down and explain their arguments well.

Just becuase I have read a type of cp in the past, does not mean i think it is legitimate.
I tend to think
Condo is good
Pics too
Consult/Condition-I think they are competitive but probably not legitimate
States/ international fiat probably arent good- but i can definetally be convinced otherwise

Topicality-
I probably think that it is the negs burden to prove that the affirmatives interpretation of debate is bad, not just that the their interpretation is better. There should probably be a balance between limits and aff predictability.

offense defense-
I will vote on zero risk of a disad- but its probably hard to win that an argument has zero risk.

I think most judges tend to grant da's more risks of links than risks of solvency deficits and I will try not to do this.

evidence
logical arguments make sense and should be made early in the debate. You dont need evidence to prove an argument is bad. Reading the un-underlined part of the other teams evidence is often very helpful. Cx is a great time to focus on big flaws in the other teams main arguments.
