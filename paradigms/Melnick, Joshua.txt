  I debated LD for Lexington for four years. I am willing to listen to any argument, and potentially vote for it, as long as you tell me why. I like standards and value criterions and any structure that you give the round, but I like clash even more, so do what you want, as long as you explain it.

I liked weird arguments, and I still do, as long as they're good; That said, I'm also very critical of them and I'll always take a good round over a gimmicky one.

I'll vote for theory, but I don't like it unless there's actual abuse. Just keep that in mind.

I used to be able to flow speed, but it has been a while since I've tried, so I can't promise that I still can. If you go fast at the cost of clarity, I'll call you on it twice, then I'll stop flowing. If you're clear but I just can't keep up, I'll call speed.
