  I debated for 4 years in high school, and I currently coach for Sam Barlow. 
I'll listen to whatever arguments you put forward, this is your debate. Personally I tended towards a slightly more policy oriented outlook, but I both ran and am comfortable with Ks. I've voted on plenty of arguments I vehemently disagree with, so I really can't emphasize the "this is your round" aspect heavily enough. I'll vote on Time Cube if you debate it well enough. 
The only other important thing to know is I'm a strict flow judge. I will vote low point wins if the flow says one team won. That means strategy is big. Running arguments that don't get you to a win won't get you the ballot even if they sound nice. If you have other questions ask them when we get there.
