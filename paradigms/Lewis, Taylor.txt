  Background
I debated primarily LD for 4 years in high school in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon).
Currently, I debate at Tufts University.

General
Give me good arguments, roadsign (I like a tidy flow), and have fun!

Evidence
Although I love straight argumentation, I think too often LDers ignore the evidence used by their opponent and accept it without question. If you have your suspicions ask! On the other side be prepared for this and be familiar with where you are drawing your facts.

Framework
I believe in many instances this will be the most interesting part of a good LD round. I look for cogent arguments about why your value ought to be upheld above your opponents. Do not ignore this portion of the debate because this will be the first level I turn to when deciding the winner. Also be sure to link all impacts to your value (and maybe even your opponents).

Speed
The ultimate goal of both debaters is to persuade the judge (me). Thus, speed is ok as long as you maintain a degree of understandability and coherence. Sacrificing these will absolutely impact your speaker points and your arguments on my flow.

Kritiks
I am not a huge fan of this type of argumentation and would much rather watch a round without ever straying into this field. However, I understand that sometimes they are warranted. In these cases (which I do not think are often) use ample argumentation and impaction to tell me why this actually matters in the round.

Good luck!
