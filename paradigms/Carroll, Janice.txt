  I'm an LD judge who believes in debate on the topic -- I want to hear you be SLOW and PERSUASIVE. This isn't policy debate, and it is no place for your T arguments or your DAs. There is a reason LD was created. Try to compare values, and most importantly, clash. While I'm not a lay person, I believe that any lay person should be able to watch an LD round and understand what is going on.
