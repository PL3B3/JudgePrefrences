  Debate history: Nationally competitive 4th year debater for UC Lab.

I try to the best of my abilities to be tabula rasa when I judge. That being said I don't have strong argument preferences.

However, I enjoy a good case debate. Impact calculus no matter what argument you are going for is essential; if you do none and the other team calls you out on it I'm inclined to believe there is no impact to your argument. I like a story.

I also think debate should be more of a performative activity, sound pretty when you speak, look at me when you speak, and make sure your technical.


Advice:
Be funny.
Use cross-x effectively.
Don't let speed come at the cost of clarity.
Don't take lots of flashing time, there's button on synergy, use it.
Don't be disrespectful.
Disclose before the round, if the other team hasn't make it clear to me.

Pet Peeves:
If you say, "THEY CONCEDED", when they haven't I'll just assume you don't know how to flow and doc your speaks.
Being mean to your partner, its a team activity.
Debating theory at "card reading speed".
