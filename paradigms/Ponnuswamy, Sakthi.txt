  I am a freshman at UC Berkeley and debated at Presentation High School for 4 years. Two of those years were on the circuit. If you have any questions e-mail me at sakthi.swamy@berkeley .edu

Voices Specific:
I haven’t done any work on this topic and this is going to be my first time judging varsity, so don’t expect me to know any obvious things. It’s been a while since I’ve flowed fast rounds, so start slow and keep things organized please.

Defaults:


- Drop the debater on T
- Drop the arg on theory
- Presumption flows aff

This being said – I can be persuaded either way for everything.

Stylistic Things:
- Flash whatever you read and disclose – if you do I’ll give you +1 speaker points
- Prep time ends when your flash drive leaves your laptop
- CX is binding
- Always weigh/crystallize

Speaks:
- They won’t be low unless you’re rude to your opponent

Theory/Topicality:
- I’ll vote on everything, but if your theory shell is super frivolous expect your speaks to go down. I personally always believed theory should only be used when there’s abuse in the round.
- I totally understand why RVIs are needed, so don’t be afraid to run them in front of me.

K’s
- I didn’t run them a lot in high school, or for that matter, understand them really well. Simple K’s should be fine, but if you’re running anything super complex either don’t or please explain it to me in simple words. Frankly, I’m probably not the best judge to read them in front of either way just because of my minimal practice reading/writing them in high school and my minimal practice being a judge.

Disads/CP
- Go for it! I’ll understand it! Nothing much to say here.

Framework:
- Just keep it organized please. Weigh the frameworks and I’ll be fine. I ran a lot of util in high school, but definitely know my way around other frameworks.
