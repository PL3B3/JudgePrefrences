  As someone who has been involved with debate for a number of years, I am familiar with the format of Lincoln-Douglas debating. I do not appreciate either competitor speaking at an unreasonably rapid pace, or "spreading." I find this to be counterproductive, because I am unable to discern what the speaker is saying and thus I am unable to flow. Beyond that, however, I expect a respectful round where both competitors avoid personal attacks on one either, do not treat each other with disrespect, and address each other in a voice of reasonable volume (in other words, don't yell). When it comes to "drops," I consider a value, value criteria, contention, or observation to be "dropped" if it is not addressed in a speech that it should be addressed in, and the point will go to the other competitor at that point. When determining a winner, I base my decision on the quality of the arguments and the rebuttals.
