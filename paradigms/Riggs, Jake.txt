I'm not as good with speed as I once was, but I can usually keep up with good signposting.
I'm comfortable with just about anything. Like most judges, I try to be a clean slate, like most judges however, I fail. 

tl;dr Limit your speed and you'll be fine, I like a good k debate, ask me anything else you SPECIFICALLY need to know before the round.
