  Background:

I am currently entering my eleventh year as the head coach at Princeton High School in Princeton, NJ. Before this time, I came from Texas where I mostly competed in the Speech world.

Paradigm:

I used to consider myself a Traditional Flow Judge; however, as I gain more experience, I find more nuanced arguments appealing. I want a clear reason to vote for you, but other than that, please weigh and impact your arguments. Though I will vote off Theory, I am still "warming" up to it. I do like interesting off-case arguments, but don't read an off-case just because you can do it. I am learning to handle speed, but I am still not completely adept at it so be gentle. I will, however, yell "clear" if I can't understand you. Three times, and I will stop flowing and draw a very angry face on your ballot. During CX, I don't care if you sit, stand, or do a little jig whilst speaking. In fact, I might give you 30 speaks if you do a little jig whilst speaking. In other words, please have fun. It's a game.
