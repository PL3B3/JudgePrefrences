  I think Lincoln-Douglas debate is a balancing act of form and arguments. I don't think a good debater can have one without the other. Unlike other types of debate, the art of public speaking factors heavily into LD debate. Physical components like eye contact and hand gestures are key to an excellent debate, as well as speaking techniques such as pacing and volume. I put a premium on excellent speaking, as it is probably the most useful skill that the debaters are building.
Hand in hand with style is content. A good argument has justifications for its assumptions and inferences rules, as well as the values it is trying to uphold. There is no right answer, so logical flow is key. It is a tradeoff between background research and on-their-feet logic in response to their opponents questions. A good debater can debate any side of an issue and maintain the same logical standards throughout.
