  I debated for three years in Fayetteville, Arkansas at Fayetteville high. I am now a freshman at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville where I am a member of the UofA StuCo/IPDA team.
As far as my philosophy goes, I'm a tab judge; I'm fine with any and all arguments as long as they are logical; I'm pretty good with speed, just at least go slower on tags and dates. I want to see arguments presented effectively and answered correctly.
Good Luck.
