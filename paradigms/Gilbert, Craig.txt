  I was the Lincoln-Douglas debate coach of Stuyvesant High School from 2011-2012 and have judged at several national circuit tournaments since rejoining the activity. As a competitor, I qualified to the TOC as a freshman in '06, but stopped debating immediately afterwards. While I prefer substance debate, I am comfortable with all forms of argumentation and will say clear if you are speaking too fast. You probably won't be. In terms of speaker points, this is what I've decided on: 28 points for technical skills, 1 point for winning, and 1 point for style. What do I mean by style? Whatever you make it mean. Some people are hilarious and others are likable jerks, but most debaters are just awkward and/or mean. Don't be either and I will give you half a speaker point. The other half is reserved for that special debater who is master of their domain.
