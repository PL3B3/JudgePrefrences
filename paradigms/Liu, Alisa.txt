  Hi! I debated for Interlake, locally for two years and nationally for two more, and was at the ToC my senior year (2016).

CPS ’16: I haven’t judged a round after graduating, so please ease into your top speed. Don’t assume I know anything about the topic.

General:
I will say clear repeatedly without docking speaks, so long as I see that you are making an effort. However, being unclear probably won’t work in your favor. Slow down on tags and emphasize author names and important parts of evidence.I have a low standard for extensions of arguments that were completely conceded.All arguments (even conceded ones) must make sense for me to vote on them. That is, your blips mean very little to me if they hardly have a warrant and don’t interact clearly with what you’re trying to answer.I will try to average my speaks at 28, but I suspect it will be somewhat higher in practice. They told me math would be useful in real life, so if you would like your speaks disclosed I will give you a math problem to solve for them.
The following are defaults that I have no strong feelings about and would prefer not to rely on, meaning if they come into play in the round, you should probably make the relevant arguments.
Fairness over educationSpirit over textNo RVICompeting interpsDrop the argumentPresumption flows Aff, permissibility flows Neg
I’m keeping this short because alas, I am still in the midst of finals. Feel free to ask me questions before the round!

Happy debating. :)
