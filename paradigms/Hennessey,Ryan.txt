  I am a former LD competitor (when LD was...."traditional") and am now an LD coach. I coach a very diverse team that has a lot of debaters and IErs, and I coach it all.

Some things you should know about me as a critic:

I consider myself to be a tab judge with common sense. I will buy almost any argument as long as it is well warranted and explained well unless it is patently ridiculous.*

I am 5/10 for speed, and it is not my responsibility to tell you to be clear. If you think that your clarity is being sacrificed, slow down. It is far more important to me (and valuable to you) to make smart arguments as opposed to lots of blippy arguments.

Standards are important and most of the time is the key to determining who wins the round for me. With that said, if you don't tell me what I should be voting on in the round, I will decide on my own (and you may not like what I decide is most important).

As far as speaker points are concerned, discourtesy is the easiest way to get docked a lot of speaker points. Be polite, enjoy yourself, and have a good time.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask before the round.

Addition for TOC 2018 - 
*1) TRUTH over TECH
2) I'm about a 5/10 for speed
3) I probably won't vote on theory on "potential abuse".
