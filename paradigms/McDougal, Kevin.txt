  Lincoln Douglas Judge Philosophy/Paradigm 

Most importantly, your case must link back to your value/value criterion. I expect clear explanations of how each contention links to the value and value criterion. In round, there should be clear clash and dialogue over conflicting interpretations of the values. Provide clear explanations of your analysis. Contentions should be well-organized and presented in a clear and logical progression of ideas. Clash and rebuttals matter and KVIs will greatly influence how I evaluate the round (if well-developed, organized, and convincing). Weighing mechanisms should be used without to prove that you have won and offensive strategies should ultimately determine the winner. 

I can flow a fast round, but please pay attention to how much I'm flowing. It is up to you to make sure that I understand. Speed only works if it is delivered strategically and clearly. 

Cross-ex matters and your strategy shines through in cross-ex. Politeness and calmness proves your confidence.
