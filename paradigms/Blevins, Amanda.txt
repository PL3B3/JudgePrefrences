I'm pretty new to the debate world. I consider myself a traditional LD judge that likes to vote on communication skills and a resolution of ideas. I do not like speed. You should be able to use word economy to make better arguments with the time that you are given. You should not run off-case or Ks. Stick to the basics to get my ballot.
