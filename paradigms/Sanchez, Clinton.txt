  My Name is Clinton Sanchez. I debated a bit my Freshman year of high school as well as in college. I've been judging for a little over a year and have judged PF, LD, and Congress tournaments.

Speaks: I will disregard anything I cannot completely understand, so do no prioritize speed over clarity. Be respectful of your opponent. Uses of derogatory language or any 'attacks' on anything that doesn't have to do with their argument will not be tolerated. 
Signposting: Will almost always help me to keep track of your arguments and points 
Extensions: I will not consider extensions of cards, authors, or any sources, but I will consider extensions of arguments.
 Timing: Do not depend on me to keep time for you. I will let you know when your time is up, but I expect that you will be able to time your own arguments.

Besides those things above, I tend to let the debaters utilize whatever techniques are at their disposal. I am open to theories, kritiks, disadvantages, and counter-plans etc. What you should know though, is that I almost always value legitimate evidence over pure theory or conjecture. I follow Tabula Rasa, so my choice is about the current argument being given rather than preconceived ideas regarding morality.

I do not tend to give any oral critiques. Any feedback will be given on the ballot.
