  I'm a pretty mellow judge and am basically okay with anything being run, though I do appreciate being told why you're running it. That extends to method of argumentation as well in that I don't really mind if you spread so long as I can understand you, you can go as fast you like. Try and have evidence [[#|backing up]] your arguments especially if they're statistics. Remember to have fun while debating and don't be a prick to your opponents.

In regards to my judging style for Lincoln Douglas I prefer when the debate focuses on the Value and VC but am okay with Kritiks and theory.
