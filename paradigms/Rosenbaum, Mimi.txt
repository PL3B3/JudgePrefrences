  

I have coached Lincoln-Douglas debate for sixteen years. I was the coach for East Side High School, Newark, NJ. and I am presently the LD coach at University High School, Newark, NJ. I have also developed several Public Forum teams. In addition to coaching, I have judged at various tournaments on all levels: local, regional and national.
I am a traditional judge. I do not like excessive speed no do I care for theory or critiques. I look for the link back to the resolution, for supporting evidence, extending and weighing arguments and impacts. I usually depend on my flow to determine who might have won the round.
