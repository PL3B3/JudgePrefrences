  I debated for Winston Churchill High School for four years in LD with some Policy experience. I went to UTNIF Policy camp the summer before my senior year and taught LD at VBI this summer.
I'm fine with pretty much everything, although I do find it a bit more difficult to follow along with heavy/long link chains/scenarios in util type debates. I'll yell clear/slow, especially for tags/authors. Speaks start at 27 for CX, 28 for LD.
