  I'm a first year debater at Binghamton University.

-I am open to all types of arguments. Please do try to put Ks into context, though; I'm not a fan of pushing generic link stories without any specific regard to the case. 
-As a new debater interested in what makes debate truly important, you can hook my interest with a good framework argument. 
-Also, don't just throw your evidence against the other team's evidence; do some comparison. Surely you've heard this plenty of times.

Otherwise, read tags clearly and don't talk over the other team during cross examination. That isn't fun to watch and can drown out important questions/answers. I'll understand if you get passionate, but if you're being intentionally rude be prepared to lose speaker points.
