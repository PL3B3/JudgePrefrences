  Me
I debated Lincoln Douglas for Coral Springs High in Florida for 3 years and graduated in 2015. I currently attend Northeastern University.

tl;dr Slow down when I call clear, theory can be fun but don't be a prick. :^)

General Paradigm
I default to comparative worlds. Feel free to engage in the paradigm debate, but be sure to clarify and compare the implications of viewing debate differently (i.e. truth testing). Clarity and weighing is also important.

Speed
I can flow most speeds, though I suggest not going too fast. Please please please be clear. Slow down on theory interps/plan-cp texts/tag lines/ names of authors. Clear for me basically means slow down. I'll call clear three times before I dock speaks.

Theory
I think it's cool how theory can be strategic, but I still prefer it when used as a check against abuse. This means spend time on your shells and develop them.

Policy arguments
They make sense. I actually enjoy policy arguments because the clash is usually very clear. Make sure you explain the function of the argument within the round. 

Kritiks
Explain your Role of the Ballot and why your arguments come before your opponent's. Be clear about your advocacy.

Feel free to ask questions before and after the round, and have fun.
