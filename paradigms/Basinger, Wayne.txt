  Overview: 

I have an extensive background in both policy and value debate (LD, policy, and CEDA), but I have been out of the activity for over 10 years. While I am very knowledgeable about debate and argumentation, I am unfamiliar with this year's topic and I will not be able to keep up with a full speed policy round due to my time away from the activity.

Background:

I competed in LD and policy debate in high school. In college, I competed in CEDA debate as it was making its merger with NDT, so I am familiar with both value and policy debate. In graduate school, I was an assistant debate coach for two years. 

Preferences:

In policy debate rounds, I prefer traditional plan vs. counterplan debate. I am open to all theory debates and will vote on topicality, kritiks and whole resolution arguments if they are run effectively. If you are planning to use non-traditional debate methods, please justify why they are valuable and deserve my ballot.

In LD debate, I prefer a round in which the opponents clash with each other's positions. Clash is key.

Dislikes:

I do not like rude behavior in debate rounds. I like confident debaters, but treating others poorly is a sign of an unskilled debater. Rude behavior will result in a loss of speaker points and may lose you the round.

Need more information:

I try to be very direct during rounds. If I cannot flow you because you are going to fast, I will tell you to slow down. If you are unclear, I will let you know.

If anything is unclear, ask me.
