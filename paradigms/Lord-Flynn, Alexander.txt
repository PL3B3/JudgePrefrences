  I am primarily a philosophy and flow judge. I think speed is good as long as it is coherent and articulated. I will vote primarily on your value and value criterion clash and case structure. Off-time road maps are unacceptable. Drops of whole contentions are important, and you should tell me why they're important, but drops of single facts or details are not as important. As for timing, I will time the round, and it is okay for your to time yourselves as well. I have strong preference if you sit or to stand to speak. Pleas stand to read your case and rebuttals.
