Debated 4 years at Appleton West High School in Wisconsin and 2 years (2005-06 and 2008-09) for Concordia College; currently coaching for Appleton West.

I have been to 8 tournaments this year and have judged 30+ varsity rounds on the Poverty topic

Here is the nutshell version of my philosophy: do what you are comfortable with, and try to make sense of it to me. I have certain preferences about arguments but really I try most to be a fair evaluator of the round that happens in front of me more than having an influence on what happens in a room. I have debated pretty conservatively at various points in my career but lately I've been running more radical arguments - the point is I am probably okay with most of what you can think of to run. That said, I'm not the fastest flow, so it would be wise to give me pen time on theory and tags to avoid miscommunications.Other than that, be nice to each other and try to do something fun.
