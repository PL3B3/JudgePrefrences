   Novice LD Coach/ Varsity Judge for Edina High School

Attended Edina High School 2004-2008

Positions:
I am open to all different kinds of positions and don't have a preference either way (stock v nontraditional). You can run whatever you would like in front of me but feel free to ask me questions before a round.

Speed:
Medium. I am fine with speed as long as it’s clear. If I can't understand what is being said due to clarity and don't get it on my flow then it's not on the flow. But I’ll give you a warning if it is too fast/unclear. 

Theory:
To be completely honest I am not that comfortable with theory. But more importantly I don't buy it generally. Unless there is clear abuse in the round and it seems like the only recourse then I might vote off of it, if it is run properly, but if it is just a strategic ploy I don't find it very persuasive. 

Standards:
I don't care if you use a traditional value/criterion set up or something completely different. As long as you justify why we should use your setup then it is fine. It is your job to tell me how I am supposed to adjudicate the round (i.e. Standards/Burdens/ect). This includes which standards are being used or what is being used instead of a standard and what order I should evaluate them in. Though whatever you do decide on for the round there needs to be clear links/impacts back to the standard/agreed upon framework. Also, weighing in the round needs to be articulated and not implied.  

If you have any other questions feel free to ask e-mail me (Robb.lauren@gmail.com) or ask me before the round.
