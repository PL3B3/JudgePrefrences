  I am a parent judge and prefer traditional LD debate.

I am not good at flowing, don't go crazy fast. Sign-post well and please organize your cases in an easy-to-flow manner. If you go super fast with tons of analytics, chances are I have no idea what's going on. 
Topical arguments have a lot more voting weight to me. 
I'd like to see you putting the pieces together instead of having me connecting the dots for you.
