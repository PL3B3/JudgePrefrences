  I am currently a second year undergrad student at the University of Pennsylvania. I was coached by Aaron Timmons, Neil Conrad, and Jake Nebel my senior year at Greenhill School. 

I am skeptical of a prior arguments. I don't like spikes. I do value well structured arguments with supported evidence. You should point out flaws in your opponent's evidence, and if need be, I will look at evidence after the round. Please you tell me how I should view the round and which arguments should be prioritized. I have a good understanding of Kritiks, disadvantages, plans, and old school LD debate, but I haven't been involved with the debate community since I graduated, so take that into consideration.
