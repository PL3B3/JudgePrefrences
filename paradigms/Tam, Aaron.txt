  I debated four years for Bronx Science and I am a freshman at Webb Institute.

In terms of arguments, I highly enjoy counterplan disad debates and case debates.
I am okay with T, I will vote for it but there needs to limits debate for me to evaluate T best.
In terms of kritiks, I am not so fond of them but if you clearly explain them early in the round I will be okay.
I am also not so fond of performance, but make framing clear because I default to a basic policy making framework.
Please provide reasons to vote for your team in your last rebuttals [impact calc and framing].
Please speak clearly on tags and cites.
Feel free to ask me about specific questions in round.
