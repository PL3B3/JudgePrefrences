Meta Issues
- I worked at the Spartan Debate Institute for four weeks over the summer. Keeping this in mind, I’m not too familiar with the topic so specific advantage counterplans/tricky case turns will probably require more investment.

- I’m also new to judging – that means a lot of the following here is probably subject to change over time/I’m still learning.

- A dropped argument doesn’t translate into a true argument ex. Reverse voting issue

- I tend to read a lot of evidence. If you initiate evidence comparison = good = I don’t have to read as many cards. Evidence comparison also determines how I’ll read said cards. A debate filled with evidence does not necessarily mean that an argument is going on – you should challenge the logic behind the evidence. If it’s dumb, you should point it out.



Disads/Counterplans
I like a good DA+CP and/or case debate. I think defensive arguments can reduce the disad to zero risk or close to it. Impact comparison is obviously important. 

Kritiks
I’m not well versed in the literature. This will definitely require more work on your part in terms of explanation. 

Theory/Framework
Affs should probably have a plan text and negatives should have stable advocacies.

My gut reactions tend to be the following:
Conditionality, pics, multi-plank advantage CPs, international actor fiat = good
Consult, conditions, delay, word PICs = probably bad

Unless persuaded otherwise, theory is usually a reason to reject the argument and not the team.

Speaker Points
Speaker points are arbitrary, but after judging my first high school debate tournament, I realized I’m a point fairy. I’m working on that. 

Policy on Paperless
You don’t need to take prep to flash speeches. Don’t abuse this privilege and take 10 minutes to jump a speech. And please dear God don’t send the speech as separate documents. It makes everyone’s life difficult. You should always have a USB drive and a viewing computer upon request.
