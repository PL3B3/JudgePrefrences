LD Paradigm


My experience as a debater was all in LD. By default I evaluate the round using the criterion, but will use any standard that you give me so long as you provide a warrant for doing so. I'm fine with progressive argumentation. There isn't any structure of argument that I refuse to listen to, so feel free to run K's, CP's, DA's, or Theory. Regardless of what you choose to run, you must extend warrants and give clear impact analysis. I won't give very much weight to blippy argumentation. If you want me to evaluate a certain argument, then tell me to do so.

As far as speaker points and delivery goes, I'm fine with speed as long as you're clear. Powerful rhetoric will be rewarded with higher speaker points. I believe that this is still an activity based in persuasive speech, and that will be reflected in speaker points. That being said, I vote off of the flow. Persuasive ability isn't enough to win if you lack in-round strategy.
