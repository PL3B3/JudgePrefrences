  I am a parent judge for Randolph High School. I've been judging LD for 3 years. Please speak slowly and clearly. When evaluating the round, I look at the quality of arguments and who is winning the round overall. I like to see voting issues and crystallization at the end of your final speeches. I also prefer full disclosure, sir.
