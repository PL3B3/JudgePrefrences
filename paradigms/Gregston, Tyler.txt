  I suppose I am not a very picky judge in general. If you want to try something new, feel free but don't think you will have an advantage by reading a "cool" argument. On that same note, I will vote on probably anything but I would have to say I default to a policy maker. Thus, impact calculus is critical if you desire to win, no matter the argument you go for. If there is no impact calculus, that leaves me to do my own rationalizing on the various impacts after the round and that is certainly not what you as a debater wants. As far as speed goes, feel free to go as fast as you want and I should be able to flow it, but if not you will be made aware of it rather quickly. I am not the fastest flower, but I have no problem in most rounds. You should also be aware that additional pen time is likely to be needed on tags, topicality, and theory debates, especially if it is a viable 2NR/2AR strategy. Feel free to ask me additional questions about specific arguments etc.
