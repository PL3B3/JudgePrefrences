  Although I am a dreaded "Mom Judge", I have been judging since 2009 & have judged at the local, state & national levels. I live with a debater & have been well trained by our local schools. 
I prefer traditional LD with contentions that support a strong value structure.If you waiver from traditional, you must be able to present your case so that your opponent & judge understand it. Presentation can impact how persuasive you are. If you read your case, don’t mispronounce words. Pace should deliberate & even. Avoid distractions like the pen flip or foot tap.You can be assertive without being aggressive, confident without being arrogant. Good sportsmanship is a commendable debate quality.I can follow any argument if presented clearly. I take lots of notes (like a college lecture) & flow.Roadmaps & voting issues are appreciated. Be organized & make your case easy to follow. I don’t need to be told the rules of debate.I am not impressed by spreading & if I can't hear it, I can't consider it.Know your audience & persuade me….
