  I'll vote on literally anything in any type of round.

I believe in no judge intervention, whatsoever.

Speed- 10/10. I'll only say clear once, and I honestly probably won't. It's your performance and I'm not going to coach you through it. That being said, if it's something that you're REALLY trying to work on, let me know and I'll help you out. 

Theory- Go for it. Friv T is fine.

K- Ks are awesome, fascinating, and educational to me, so definitely don't hesitate running in front of me, but please know that I am not very well read. Do enough work on the alt.

Role of the ballot/role of the judge: These type of arguments are VERY important to me. If ROB or ROJ is prevalent in the round KNOW that it WILL affect my RFD. 

Speaks: Speaks depend on a couple of factors. First, how well you formulate your arguments and how good of a debator you are. Secondly, if your rude (and I mean like really rude) I'll deduct speaker points. Definitley clarify with me if speaks are critical to you. 

Feel free to ask me any questions. I did this in a bit of a rush, so sorry if I left anything out.
