  I prefer conversational speed to spreading
I prefer to determine the winner of a round based upon whose arguments are more likely to be true.
I prefer to judge a round based on the strengths and weaknesses of each case rather than on technicalities.
I prefer topical arguments to tangential ones, which means I prefer to judge rounds directed primarily towards the resolution. I will listen to arguments that are indirect, and I may even vote on them, but - all else being equal - when faced with a focused topical argument versus a distant catch-all kritik, I prefer the former to the latter.
I ask that you provide me with a spare copy of your case, given that you have a spare, to be returned at the end of the round.
I will call for evidence after the round.
