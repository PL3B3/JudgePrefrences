I try to judge in the tabula rasa sense as much as possible. I hope to see the debaters provide their own logical, thoughtful arguments, not just repetition of another person’s thoughts. I highly value thorough explanations of impacts. I want to see clash in the round. 

I expect debaters to keep track of their own prep time, although I will time it in case of any great discrepancy. Prep time begins right after the debater announces how much they will take.

I do not wish to see documents; questionable evidence or speeches are the responsibility of the opponent to peruse and/or address during the debate.

I tend to award speaker points between 88 – 100. I think that in the high school realm, those competing should not be discouraged because of low points. Clear speech using excellent vocal delivery will garner more points, whereas if I cannot understand the speaker, the speaker will receive less points. It is the speaker’s responsibility to ensure they are speaking clearly, and I will not intercede. I am sure that I use some nonverbal cues such as my facial expression to indicate that I cannot understand the speaker.

I do not read evidence after a debate, and I do not care for spread in any debate.
