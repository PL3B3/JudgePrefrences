  Generally speaking, my judging philosophy is that this is your debate round, so you should utilize the debate space however you would like. Do not be concerned with what kind of arguments I like to hear. Thus, you do not need to adjust your strat for me. What you will need to do is make sure Iâ€™m able to follow you. Make sure you signpost when you are moving on to the next argument. I will not put things together and assume you are talking about a certain argument. Also, do not leave me to decide who I should vote for at the end of the round. Your speeches should direct me on what to sign my ballot for. I really like impact calculus's to help me to decide where to vote. 

In terms of speed...I have been debating for three years now, so I am able to keep up with speed reading. However. I find it very hard to catch up when there is not signposting. So make sure you signpost well for me..
