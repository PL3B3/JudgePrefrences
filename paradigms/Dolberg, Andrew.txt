  I am the President of Champion Briefs and Director of the Champion Briefs Institute. I have coached PF, Congress, and Speech events for the last 5 years but I do have an understanding of LD and Policy as well.

Speed: I can take high levels of speed but you may lose me if you spread extensively. I will tell you to slow down if I'm falling behind.

Argumentation: While I believe that the resolution is ultimately the most important question of the round, I will vote for any argument provided sound support and proper weighing. Please avoid abusive and blippy arguments.

Speaker points: Determined based on overall quality of debate and CIVILITY of discourse.

Debate is debate, no matter the event. If you explain your arguments and weigh why they're more important than your opponent's, you'll win my ballot.
