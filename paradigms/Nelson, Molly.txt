Framework - While I enjoy a good framework, it becomes too much when 3/4 of your AC must be dedicated to analyzing the framework with little time spent on the meat of the debate - meaning your contentions.

Philosophy - I am experienced in Continental, Analytic, Historical, Liberalism, and Eastern philosophies, so do not be afraid to run a philosophy-heavy case, so long as you extend your contentions and do not misconstrue the authors.

Extensions - Extensions are extremely important on both sides. I want to see extensions to understand how well you can argue your side and oppose the Aff/Neg.

Kritiks - I do not particularly care for these. I think they undermine the spirit of the debate and give an even larger bias towards the neg.
