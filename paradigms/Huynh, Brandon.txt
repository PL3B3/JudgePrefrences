  Hello

I'm Brandon, a lot of people call me Sadfish =] Anyways. I debated for Bingham High School for 3 years and now am the assistant coach for my high school. 

I'm a really laid back judge. It's your debate round, do what you want. Basically I'm a tab judge =] 

However, I do have things that I do like to see in a debate round. I AM A FLOW JUDGE/DEBATER!!!! That means reading overviews at me and counting that as 'work' doesn't do anything for you in the debate. I am excessively flow oriented and the only way of getting perfect speaker points from me is to be all about the line by line while giving a great impact scenario. 

You can go for any argument. You just need to give me a clear link story and impact your arguments. In high school I was able to debate T, Theory, Framework and the K really well; however don't let this disincentives you to go for any other off case positions. You can run performance arguments, just please, make sure it makes sense! I don't like to call for evidence and if I have to that means explanation was lacking and be prepared for judge intervention at that time..... Also please SLOW DOWN on PLAN TEXT, PERM TEXT, THEORY, K ALTERNATIVES, CP TEXT, ect. ect. Other than that speed is fine. =] 

If anything just stick to FLOW debating! =] and humor is always good =] 

Good luck! =]
