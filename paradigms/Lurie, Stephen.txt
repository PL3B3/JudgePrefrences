  Hello there!
Let's make things easy:
1)School affiliation- Cherry Creek High School
2) # of rounds judged on this year's topic: 0, but I will be researching the topic and watching practice debates before The Glenbrooks.
3)number of years judging: 3
4)LD Paradigm/Background info.

-I debated for 4 yrs in high school, primarily in LD and some in PF and CX. I competed at the Gbrooks 3 times, Berkeley 3 times, and NFL Nationals twice, as well as copious amounts of local tournaments. I am willing to listen to and vote for many many forms of debate. 

THAT BEING SAID:

-I can handle speed, but I will be less than pleased if you are wasting words on faulty/weak arguments and time sinks. I can LOVE a SLOW or FAST debate, but I am primarily concerned with what you are saying. If you do choose to spread you must be clear and comprehensible.

-There is also a fine line between being confident and being disrespectful, and we can't have competent debate if you are going to absolutely brutalize your opponent.

-If your argument is reasonable, or at least portrayed in a reasonable light, I can vote for it. As a debater I was a huge fan of unique argumentation and strategy, but it is fine if you run stock arguments, just make it worthwhile.

-I like critical argumentation as long as it isn't too contrived.

-I am open to theory debates but they have to concern a real issue. Don't waste my time with theory that is only loosely tied to the debate and you are just running as a time sink.

- If you go new in the 2 you better be winning by a whole ton before that because that is a clear way to get voted down.

- I can dig performance.

-I follow a strict flow but not every nit picking argument can win you a round. YOU MUST IMPACT.

-As for Value debate, this can be vital or a wash depending on the round, but it will often provide me a lens to view the round.

I will be open to any questions (and comments I guess) before round, and I will also give a brief overview of this little document here.

See you soon! Unless you just happen to have clicked my name because it sounded really sexy when in fact I am not judging you. Oh well.
