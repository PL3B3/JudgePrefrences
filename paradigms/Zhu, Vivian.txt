  I did 3 years of policy debate at Kamiak High School (western Washington) from 2009-2012. I now study at UC Berkeley.I consider myself to be tabula rasa and am open to almost* any kind of argument. I will vote based on what you convince me is most important in this round. This means that:for Ks or critical and performance affs: you need to convince me that I should prefer your framework before getting into impact calculus.for topicality and theory: that the abuse is a voting issue; or on the flip side, that it is not a voting issue.I like to see clash and prefer depth over breadth of arguments. That said, I am comfortable with spreading as long as you are clear. I want to vote on arguments in the 2NR/2AR that have been clearly argued throughout the debate.
Be polite, be clear, be persuasive.

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about my paradigm before the round.

*The only arguments I will not consider are those that are blatantly morally repugnant, such as a "rape good" impact turn. You will also be penalized with low speaks if you make such an argument.
