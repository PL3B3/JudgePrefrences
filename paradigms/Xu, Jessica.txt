  If I am your judge, here are a few things to remember:

-I am a first year out but I don't judge often

-I won't vote on arguments that are sexist, racist, homphobic, etc.; being in a debate round doesn't give you a free pass to say absurd things.

-I am not a micropol hack; I was a micropol debater but that doesn't mean that I'll vote on any micropol. I still hope to see many of you keeping the micropol debate alive!

-I have been described as a 'speaks fairy'


I want to see you:

-Have an actually interesting debate; don't just read the same arguments and blocks from all your other rounds...rehashing the same topical debate in every round isn't exciting for anyone. Try something new, take risks!

-(If you read unconventional arguments like I did), EXPLAIN YOUR ARGUMENTS REALLY WELL.

-Treat your opponent with respect

-Have fun! Don't take it so seriously

-Most importantly, make this activity your own. There's a reason we all do this activity...debate equips us with a lot of important skills. Make something of it and remember why you do it.

If you want to know what I think about specific types of argumentation, please just ask me before your round.

P.S. I particularly enjoy Role of the Ballot arguments. (MAKE THEM. EVERYBODY SHOULD START MAKING THEM.)

P.P.S. I will default to Rebar Niemi's paradigm if I have no clue how to make a decision. Or I might flip a coin.
