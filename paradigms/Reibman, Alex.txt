  TL;DR
I debated LD for 3 years in high school at state tournaments, but nothing huge. I currently do college novice policy. I like smart, clean arguments. Treat me as if I’m a well-educated person with no experience with the intricacies associated with debate—I find that those who try to get the point across rather than battling over details are most worthy of my vote. 

Preferences—

• I am currently a junior majoring in Economics and Philosophy at Emory. I love economics and philosophy arguments, but dropping names without explaining positions is no good. 
• I have experience working at public policy think tanks, so it’s easy for me to vote on realistic frameworks like cost/benefit analysis. 
• I very much like value debates. 
• Please don’t throw debate jargon or abbreviations at me. If you have to compress these words just to get a speech done, you’re moving too fast in the first place.
• I don’t like speed very much, but I can certainly handle it. I think that if your message gets lost in what sounds like a hysterical rant, you’re doing a poor job. If the opponent is going too fast for you, please let them know (it’s probably too fast for me too). 
• Please make sure you clearly enunciate your cards so that I can keep track. If it’s some weird or crazy name, say it in a way that I won’t forget.

Misc.
• Computers are fine. Please have a USB prepared in case you cannot connect to the internet.
• Please be respectful to everyone in the room, and silence your phones.
