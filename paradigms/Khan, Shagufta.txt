  I mostly have a background judging at UDL's for the past year and a half. During high school, I competed in the MDL's and now judge there. Therefore, I am mostly use to hearing on-case, topicality, disadvantages, and some basic counterplans. Any counterplans or Kritiks ran should be explained very, very clearly-meaning that you as a debater needs to understand them as well.
