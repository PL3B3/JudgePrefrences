  Debated for Brophy for 4 years with Brandon Sumner (Brophy SS)
Currently coaching for Brophy GS (1st year)
I’ve been a 2N and 2A

Top level
*Do whatever you do as best as you can do it – I judge accordingly
Tech>Truth …almost all the time, I will evaluate whether an argument was answered before I evaluate its quality but if there is ink somewhere else that you can cleverly apply to your mistake, I will hear you out

Theory
You have to slow down. I take theory seriously and need to catch everything

CPs and DAs
I hate badly run politics, if you’re running politics you better know what’s up and make it pop with real in depth analysis of the current political climate
Read the most abusive CPs you think you can get away with, just be ready on your theory game
I love when debaters go for DAs vs K affs – just make sure to nail the aff on a substantive link (or get clever with some theory to ensure a link)

K
I am well versed in K lit but I will not do explanatory work for you
K on K debates – I have no presumption on whether or not a perm is justified, that’s up to the debaters (the same goes for all theoretical positions, but I feel like this one in particular needs to be emphasized)

Speaker Points
*Disclaimer – Do not be alarmed for your speaker points or think I hate you if I say clear at the beginning of your speech (even if I say it multiple times), I have empirically had trouble flowing certain speech patterns so I may correct you until I can flow your style – but that will not reflect in your speaks)
I do not have a formula for speaker points as of yet. Until I do I will try to be gracious with them.
Be courteous, be funny, be confident
