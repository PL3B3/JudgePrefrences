  I debated LD for Torrey Pines High School in San Diego for three years (two on the circuit) and graduated in 2013. I reached three bid rounds but dropped in all of them my senior year. I'm conflicted with Torrey Pines. It's been a long time since I've been involved in the debate scene, so I probably won't be very much up to date. That being said, I'll do my best to evaluate your frameworks and arguments. Have fun! It's always nice to see students do an activity they genuinely love.
