I would say that I am more traditional in my approach to judging Lincoln-Douglas Debate.  What exactly does that mean for the contestants? I would prefer to see a debate about the criterion and how the arguments in the round apply to it. Everything should apply back to the criterion/standard. I would also prefer that debaters relate their arguments back to their stated value premise.  Too often debaters forget or ignore their value premise in the debate rounds. 

Debate the topic, defend your side and provide some offense why I should vote for you.

As far as speaking goes please stay within your own abilities. Debate should be understandable and persuasive. 

As far as theory arguments go I am not a huge fan and would prefer that debaters stay focused on substantive issues that relate to the value and the criterion/standard.
