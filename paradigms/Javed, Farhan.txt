  Hi guys. I'm a graduate of Union High School from Tulsa, OK and am currently a freshman at Harvard. I did two years of LD debate in high school. 

I strongly believe against critiques about the resolution in LD. I'm from a more traditional LD environment but as long as you have a Value, an appropriate Criterion, and the necessary contentions to back your framework up, then you're all set. I also am not a fan of spreading. Debate should be about expressing and articulating your opinion and logic clearly to the audience and judges, not competing for who can say how much the fastest.

Other than that I am prepared to vote for any argument. Just win me over with your logic!
