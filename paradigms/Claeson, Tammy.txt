  I am an LD and PF coach with twenty years of experience. I am a traditional judge, but am willing to listen to progressive arguments if they're reasonable. That being said, please have a framework by which I can evaluate the round and no spreading. 

In LD, I am looking for a value. I understand that your default is morality, but there are a variety of definitions for morality. State yours. Use a measurable standard that is attainable. I am looking for value clash. Just being able to access your opponent's framework is not enough for a win. Their framework must fall or be absorbed by yours. Make sure your overview is clear on your points won. Underviews are fine, but I prefer a strong overview. Dropped arguments will be weighted against you. Cross apply your arguments. Give me voters.

In PF, I am looking for logic, reason and relevancy. Unless the resolution specifically lends itself to a plan, don't give me one. Stand during crossfire, but you can sit during Grand Cross. Give me voters during your crystallization.
