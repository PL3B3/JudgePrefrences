- My philosophy toward judging debate is simple: BIG PICTURE
- You will not win or lose a round because you think you did a fantastically wonderful job tearing down your opponent's contention II, subpoint A, lines 10-13. Maybe you did and kudos to you. However, unless your opponent's contention II, subpoint A, lines 10-13 is of critical importance to his or her case, it will not win the round for you unless you connect it to the bigger picture. Too often debaters go "line-by-line" and fail to connect all the attacks they make on their opponent's case into one large cohesive argument.
- The negative has the burden of clash. The affirmative has the burden of proof. Do not forget this.
- Speed: After debating and judging for the better part of six years, I more or less have a trained ear and can keep up. That said, I don't like to. If I didn't understand something because you were talking too fast, then that means I don't care about it and it won't be under consideration in the round. Speak to me as though you are speaking to someone who is extremely smart (because I am) but is also impatient and has little tolerance for excessive spreading. You call it spreading, I call it spewing.
- Professionalism- Dress (that means full suits w/ties for men) and act professionally. Do not resort to personal attacks on your opponent. Do not call me "judge."(I don't address you as "debater.") Shake your opponent's hand(s) when you are finished and tell them that it was a good and enjoyable round.
- HAVE FUN!
Finally, I love debate and enjoy judging. Feel free to ask about anything before the round.
