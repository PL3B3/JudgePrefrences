I was a Varsity Policy debater during high school in the mid 70s. I have judged various Lincoln Douglas debate during the last 3 years. I prefer the Value/Criterion type of organization but will accept any reasonable organizational style. I accept theory type arguments. I can follow rapid speech as long as it is organized with clear pronunciation. and appropriate brief pauses between sentences. I will signal to each debater twice if the delivery becomes too rapid. Any argument I miss--- cannot be scored. Organized delivery is extremely helpful. I separate speaking ability from the decision as the later will be made on the arguments.
