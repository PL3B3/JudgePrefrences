  I debated LD for South Grand Prairie High School in north Texas, graduation 2005. I did not debate in college, but I have been judging tournaments since graduation and in the northeast since 2008.
I want debaters to make the rounds easy for me to judge. I can flow speed, but I rather not. Iâ€™m just looking for clear articulation, impact V/C & give voters.
