  I'm the coach at Bainbridge High School in Washington state and have been there for three years. Prior to that, I was the Mercer Island HS assistant coach. I debated in LD at Mount Vernon HS in Washington for four years and travelled a bit on the national circuit (but have since spent much more time travelling as a coach).

I am willing to listen to any argument and believe it is up to the debaters to explain why the arguments affirm or negate the resolution, or why the arguments mean that I should sign the ballot aff or neg. Assume that I am not particularly familiar with any argument because I will listen to what is said rather than what is hinted at. Please give me a clear story at the end of the round regarding why you think I should vote for you.

I have no problem with speed so long as it is still clear and used for an acceptable purpose. For instance, I saw a round where a debater didn't use all of his time but went especially fast with the intent to confuse his opponent - while I was able to follow the speed, I felt it was so innappropriate in that setting and I docked his speaker points significantly. Also, if you can't go fast and be clear, don't go fast.
