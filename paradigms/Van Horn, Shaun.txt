  Judge Philosophy for Glenbrooks 2008

Bio: I debated in HS at Brother Rice HS in Bloomfield Hills, MI from 1997-2000; at the University of Michigan from 2000-2003; at Michigan State University from 2003-2005. I spent most of my career as a 2N/1A. I have never really coached or judged much since leaving debate. I have only judged two rounds on this year's high school renewable energy topic. I'm now a lawyer in Chicago.

Style: Doesn't mean much to me, but it probably influences how I view the substance. Treat cross-examination seriously. Keep it orderly if you decide to tag-team. Clarity is more important than speed. Be civil.

Substance: I was a DA-CP debater. I like big policy throw-downs, such as impact debates, global warming, relations DAs, economy arguments, etc. And, I generally prefer to vote for teams who do this and, even more, for teams who do this well. I, of course, relish politics debates, especially if you open up mulitiple impact scenarios.

On the other hand, I will vote on Ks and T. I lean heavily negative on theory questions and I can't promise that I am capable of fairly adjudicating a theory debate, such as counter-plan theory debates. So, try that strategy as a last resort. If you do decide to go for theory or T --- you must give longer than a phrase for each point or you will lose.

If you have any questions (e.g. you are a K team or a performance team or whatever), just ask me about it before the round and in the presence of the other team. I love to talk, so you'll probably get more of an answer than you wanted.
