  HELLO! I did policy in high school and am currently a student at Cal. I'd like to think of myself as a tabula rasa judge, although I don't think anybody can be completely unbiased. I like well impacted debates, and I'm pretty open with any argument. I'm not the best at K's, but as long as it's well explained, I should be able to follow along. Don't hesitate to ask me questions in the round. And please, don't be rude.
