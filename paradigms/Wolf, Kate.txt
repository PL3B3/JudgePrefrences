Debate Experience: 4 years of policy high school debate @ Carl Sandburg High School and 4 years of Policy College Debate between Augustana College, Northern Illinois University and Illinois State University. 8 years of Judging Policy and/or Lincoln Douglas Debate.

Although I have debated strictly policy debate in the past, when I am judging LD I stay true to the LD judging paradigm provided by the NFL. Debaters need to be clear when presenting their arguments. Speed and intense philosophical arguments are not a problem as long as you are clear and explain enough for both me and your opponent.

I will only evaluate arguments that have been presented in the round. I will not fill in the gaps for you; you must make the effort to win the round. As a general rule I do not accept new arguments in rebuttals. If you have a valid reason for making new arguments, you better tell me why it is warranted, and even then don’t solely rely on them. 

Rounds need clash. Two ships sailing past each other in the night will only cause a headache for both your opponent and myself. If you want to win you need to both defend your case and attack your opponent’s. Tell me why your value is best. If your values are similar, explain how you uphold your value better.

Cross-X: This is a time to clarify and obtain information to strengthen your arguments. Make sure you understand what your opponent is presenting. There are no dumb questions in cross-x. It’s better to ask the simple questions so you understand rather than get up in your next speech and be completely lost and flustered because you didn’t ask the right questions.
