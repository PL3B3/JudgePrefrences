  I did LD successfully on the national circuit for the Collegiate School in New York, graduating in 2014. I do not judge frequently.

I will vote on any argument so long as it has a warrant, I have it flowed in the first speech, and it is not blatantly offensive. I will not intervene against you for reading arguments I dislike, but it may affect your speaker points. In general, I prefer reasonable positional debating and would like to see topical discussion. I don't enjoy tricky arguments like presumption, a prioris, cases with a lot of spikes, ect. and so will have a lower threshold for responses. I also dislike frivolous theory, so I would prefer you read it as an actual check on abuse rather than as a strategic tool. 

If you have any questions, your best bet is to ask Mark Gorthey. Otherwise, have fun!
