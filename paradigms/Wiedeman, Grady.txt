Background: I debated for four years of policy debate (Norfolk, NE), debated NFA-LD for the University of Nebraska (2 years), and am currently the policy coach at Lincoln High (NE).

Affirmative: I like when the affirmative fits the resolution, but if you can convince me that the affirmative doesn't need to be topical then I will go with it. That being said, I voted for and coach kritikal affs, I have no problem with them.

Negative: Run what you feel comfortable with. Play to your strengths and that will be a better debate all around. I like a good theory debate, but don't go out of your way to provide one if you don't feel comfortable with it or if you can't explain it well. I also really don't like disclosure theory but if that's your jam then do it. 

Kritiks: The only particular I have is that the alternative needs to be explained well.

General: I try my best to vote based off of what I hear in round. I have particular opinions about debate, but I will do my best to judge based off what I hear in round rather than use those opinions. I prefer analysis over card dumping. The more contextualized analysis is usually the more compelling to me. In general, I like it when you're genuine with your arguments. I want you to like them and I want to be able to like them. You spent a lot of time cutting these positions, do them justice.
