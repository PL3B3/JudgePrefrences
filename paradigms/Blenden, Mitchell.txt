  I was a student congress debater for four years at University School of NSU in Fort Lauderdale Florida. With that being the case I am not okay with speed, I need clear tag lines, or claims, very strong logical impacts and I also need for all arguments to be explain in terms of how they interact with each other in the round. I also like when all arguments that have been brought up have been refuted by ones opponent and I do not like dropping arguments that hold weight in rounds.
