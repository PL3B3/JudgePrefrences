  I am not related to Charlie Furman. I am a parent judge. My daughter debates for Needham High School in Needham, MA. This is my second year judging LD. 
Generally speaking, I'll vote for anything so long as there is a coherent logical chain that links back to the resolution. I prefer but don't require that debaters use a traditional value/criterion structure so long as there some sort of clear standard for the round (i.e. a burden structure). Note that I have little experience with Kritiks, Theory and more technical aspects of LD.It is very important that I see weighing done at the end of the round along with clear voters.It is the debaters' responsibilities to make sure that their arguments have clear claims, warrants, and impacts. If an argument lacks any of the three necessary components, I reserve the right to not consider it when making my RFDIf a debater wants to use an a priori argument, I require him or her to provide a reason why I should allow the argument to come pre-standardsI'm not a fan of speed, but I can follow it as long as the debater is clear, particularly with signposts.This preference was copied from Needham HS Alum Michael Lintz, with additions in blue font.
