  Hello, everyone!

First thing you should probably know is that I've been out of circuit for almost 2 years. Do not assume I'm very intimate with the resolution.

I did policy debate for Westside High School consistently sophomore and junior year, and dabbled a bit my senior year. Personal talking points consist of making it to a Valley bid round, and winning State junior year without a head coach. /end obligatory credibility assurance

Fun fact: I have never run a plan-text outside of debate camp.

My paradigm is pretty straightforward. I have an undeniable bias towards K/performance debate, but I won't vote on a losing argument regardless of my personal feelings on it.

T/Framework makes me sad, but it is what it is.

I have no strong feelings one way or another on the validity of most other debate theory such as counterplans. Essentially, assume I'll flow it as legitimate unless convinced otherwise.

Most importantly, I want the debaters to explain what they're saying and make it clear to me what their position is in contrast to the opponent. I'm very open to whatever you have to throw at me, so do what you feel most comfortable doing and I'll do my best to keep up.

Lastly, I'm friendly and like to talk, so don't feel like you need to be scared of me! If talking isn't your thing though, that's fine too. I'm very flexible.
