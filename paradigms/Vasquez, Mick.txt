  Former high school policy debater and college NPDA/APDA parli debater.

I am currently a law student but serve as the assistant parli coach at Santa Clara University.

I will consider all arguments, assuming they are well argued and I try to not bring any bias into the round. Speed should not be an issue for me but I reserve the right to let you know if you are getting too fast or unclear. I am OK with T, K, and framework type arguments but I legitimately believe that a lot of work needs to be done to effectively argue these points. If you are proposing a new framework, it is your burden of proof to explain not only what that framework is but also why I should adopt it. If either of those elements are not met, I will have trouble voting for the arguments but I WILL consider them.
