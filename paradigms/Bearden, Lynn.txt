  Current: Assisting coach Calhoun High School, Calhoun GA. Daughter Lauryn currently an 8th grader competing on the high school circuit. Trial lawyer since 1990.
Education: Calhoun High School. University of Louisville BA in Philosophy and Political Science. University of Utah Juris Doctrate.

Debate as Student: I was the Georgia State Debate Champion in 1982 under Coach Sanda Silvers. I debated for the U of Louisville coached by Tim Hynes competing at most college tournaments including NDT and the KY round robin.

Philosophy: Debate should be educational and fun! I try not to reject arguments based on personal beliefs. Don't expect me to make applications for you. I don't like rudeness and reflect it in points!

Speed: Some speed is ok. I do my best to keep up but if I can't understand you, it doesn't count.

K: As a philosophy major, I enjoy the philosophical discussion of the K. Don't assume I know the K by tag lines/lingo. You must explain it.

Topicality: must be developed, not just tag lines.
