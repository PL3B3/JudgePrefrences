  I am a Novice Parent Judge for McArthur High School and I enjoy judging IE and PF. I believe that all debaters should always try their best and follow the rules. 

I tend to look for the following:
Factual Accuracy: All evidence in your case should contain accurate and reliable sources and make sense. I will not vote for any cases that deny or avoid the science or proven facts.Arguments Organized: Debaters should present organized and flowing arguments. Presenting arguments that are incomplete or make no sense will not help.Focused: Arguments should be focused towards gaining my vote for your case. Convince me why!Confidence: Having strong confidence when presenting your case is always a plus.Tone: I extremely enjoy when debaters use a well constructed professional and enthusiastic tone when presenting cases.
Remember, your quality matters, so do your best! :)
