  I have debated for four years with three years prior at a charter academy.
I have coaching experience going on my fourth year.
I've judged quite a few rounds on the 2014-2015 topic and am familiar with most
of the literature applicable to the topic.
Judging rounds i try to be as objective as possible but like any human being i cannot be
tabula rasa, however i am fair in my RFD's.
I do read any evidence that i need to read, however i will not read all of it so debaters
do need to be as clear and articulate as possible.
i don't care what argument you run, with few exceptions. i understand most args enough to vote on them.
racist, sexist, etc. args can be voted on but your speaks will drop significantly.

Affirmatives:
i don't care what aff you run. as long as you debate it well, however why both teams
believe one should/not engage with the resolution is important.

Negatives:
Policy Options
great.
XO CPs are totally illegitimate
so are commissions CPs (Especially on non-existent commissions)
but i would vote for such CP if the aff doesnt bring it up

K's:
even better. but like any judge i do need a clear reason why the 1AC entrenches a
dangerous ideology through the plan, adv. etc.
well debated K's are my favorite thing in debate.
I am most familiar with ontology, methodology, epistimology, and language K's.
Heidegger
Foucalt
Cap
Fem
Bataille
Psychoanalysis
etc...

i havent voted on a performance K yet doesnt mean i wouldnt.

T/FW/Theory
Contextualize standards or else i won't vote on it.
otherwise it's a prior question. simple.
(you don't need to be T)

extra:
no argument in debate is ever an auto voter. if you work hard i will work hard for you.
