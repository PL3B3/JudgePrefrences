  TL;DR: Default to policymaker, unless otherwise persuaded. Speed is fine, unless incoherent. Ks are fine, unless devolving into unwarranted/unexplained jargon. +1 for overviews.

High School: George Washington (Denver, CO)
College: Olin (Needham, MA)
Experience: 4 years CX in high school
Questions: Feel free to ask before the round or email chase dot kernan at gmail.

Specifics Arguments:
T: A long, persuasive T argument can definitely win the round for me, but I can be convinced to not vote on an underdeveloped shell if the aff drops it due to being out spread.Theory: Should be as well articulated as any other argument. You'll probably have to slow down here.K: All power to you to run Ks and set a framework for the round. Just make sure that you explain in full, plain English the crux of your argument particularly if its internals are heavy on jargon.CP: CP text should be non-topical, textually and functionally competitive (but, hey, you can try to persuade me otherwise). DA: There should be a convincing story here. Obviously, impact calcs are your friends.
Other Stuff:
I have only judged a few rounds of this year's topic (infrastructure) so I won't be terribly familiar with the specifics of most plans or some of the acronyms involved.If I look confused it's probably because I'm confused, so feel free to slow down/explain your points in another way. I'm not going to pretend to be able to divorce the presentation of your arguments from the warrants behind them. Stand up, enunciate, be eloquent, cross-x matters. Debate's pretty damn fun so I won't care too much about the little things (prep time, etc.) :)You can probably persuade me to disregard anything I've said here.
