Speed: Speed is fine I have no problem flowing it just signpost and stay clear. If you aren't clear I'll let you know and I'll keep letting you know, but I won't stop flowing.

Theory: I will vote on theory, BUT it must have good analysis on it and I expect you to spend more than a 15 second blurb if you want to extend it as a voter. Also, if you are using it as a voter I expect impact to why it not being fair, or being competitive (etc.) is an issue.

Critical: I was a K debater in policy, so I expect a well developed kritik, but I will listen and vote on anything if it is warranted. I actually like most critical arguments so if you have one that works, use it. I will vote on critical arguments. Other forms of non-traditional LD debate (CP's DA's, T) I have no problem with listening to either.

I like impact calculus, but I will weigh the round on whatever you tell me. If you give me nothing to weigh off of I'll look to the standards first.

Speaker points are relatively high, generally nothing below a 25 unless it is incredibly unclear, or quality of argumentation isn't there. I'll look to the content of what is being said as much as how it is being said to determine speaker points. Speed isn't going to make you lose speaker points unless I have to tell you to be clear multiple times. Also I don't care about posture or eye contact, just avoid sitting while speaking.

If you read a card, it is free game for your opponent to ask for and read through (same with case).
I don't like to let debaters use prep time for CX, but if you really need it I will let you use it, just make sure it is worthwhile as I do flow CX.

The main thing is give me something clear to vote on in the end.
If you have any other questions just ask me before the round.
