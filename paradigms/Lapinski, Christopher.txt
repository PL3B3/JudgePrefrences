  I am a publishing professional and ESL teacher with a provisional certificate in English (grades 9-12). From 2009 to 2012, I served as a replacement teacher in the Princeton Public Schools, and in my final year, taught English and journalism at Princeton High School. Prior to teaching, I was enrolled in a doctoral program in modern history and literature at Drew University, finishing with my M. Phil. in European intellectual history. I currently work in the design department at Princeton University Press.

As a freshman in high school, I participated in forensics, competing in the area of duo performance. I am delighted to join the National Speech and Debate Association as a judge. Because I am a newcomer to debate, I prefer that the debaters present their arguments clearly and carefully. I have no experience with spreading, and will likely lose track of any argument that is emitted in rapid bursts. Quality over quantity, please.
