  I have been involved with policy debate for 10 years and debated at the college level. I have heard and seen it all. 
I want the debaters to understand that I participate as a volunteer because I enjoy the activity. As such, I want the debaters to make their best and favorite arguments. Let's have a good time and learn something together. 
Please be aware that I am not intimately familiar with the topic this year.
