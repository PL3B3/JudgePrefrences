  The bottom line is that the debater who presents the best arguments wins. There are many components in making the best argument. In my opinion the most important parts are delivery, value of content and how well the contestant presents and defends their contentions, along with how successfully they attack the contentions of their opponent.

Speaking clearly, at a moderate speed without spreading is paramount to a good delivery. If I miss portions of the message, due to a very rapid and/or mumbled delivery, then the argument is not getting fully across. While not necessary, I am impressed by eye contact and when emphasis is placed on key words and strong points. Rapid, non-stop reading bores me, enthusiasm draws my interest.

Compelling facts, cited from credible sources gets my attention but the information should be directly applicable to the resolution and/or contentions. I also like a well constructed and organized presentation. I will pick-up on random information that is not pertinent to the argument and lose interest. I also like good analysis but not spin. Kritiks are OK but should be well articulated.

In the end, winning the argument also means both the presentation and the defense of solid contentions and successfully exploiting weaknesses in your opponentâ€™s contentions. Thinking on your feet during cross is important to finishing the deal. Although I will give credit for pointing out a legitimate drop, I will view it negatively if a drop is manufactured to gain points. Also, in the rebuttals new threads of argumentation should not be introduced.
