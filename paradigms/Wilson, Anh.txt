  I am a parent judge from Harrison High School in New York. I have judged at a few tournaments in the past.

My average speaker points are a 27. I will generally not go higher than a 27.5.

 Please sign post.
 Please speak slowly and clearly.
 Please organize your thoughts so that they are understandable and flow well.
 The better the speaker, the better I understand.
 Please time yourselves.
