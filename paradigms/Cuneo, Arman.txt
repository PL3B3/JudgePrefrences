  Four years of national circuit policy debate in high school. I tried to keep this short, so if you have any specific questions please ask (or email at acuneo7@gmail.com). 
Some general points:
-I try to be as unbiased as possible regarding your selection of argumentative styles and regarding my evaluation of the merit of specific arguments
-You should therefore read whatever arguments you're best at and which give you the best chance of winning
-Notwithstanding the above, I probably lean slightly towards the "policy" side of things
-Flashing is not prep but please know how to use a flash drive
-Clarity and good line by line are greatly preferred and appreciated; you should avoid overviews whenever possible
-Explain why your arguments matter in the context of the debate as a whole and why they're voting issues 
Aff:
-I tend to lean slightly neg on framework questions; I think that most K affs are not particularly about the topic and I think that it's a huge bonus if your aff actually engages with a topical question 
-I think that your aff should have some written statement of advocacy
CP:
-These are great
-I try to be neutral on CP theory but it's going to be an uphill battle to get me to agree that I should exclude from debate some large and common category of counterplans (e.g. Agent CPs bad). Theoretical objections which are more specific in nature are likely to be more persuasive.
K:
-Go for it
-Try to avoid using an excessive amount of jargon
-The earlier points about avoiding overviews, doing good line by line, and explaining yourself apply especially to this debate
DA:
-Yeah sure whatever
-Politics is fun but be good at it
Theory:
-I'll vote on it
-Try to clearly explain your arguments and slow down a bit to ensure you communicate them clearly
Style:
-Sass is fine but don't be mean for no reason; the number of flippant remarks you can get away with is directly correlated with your skill and humorousness
 -> "It's only game, why you have to be mad?" -Ilya Bryzgalov 
-Being funny is always a plus
-Be clear
-Do line by line and signpost clearly
