  Background: I began competing in oratory and skills competitions at age 7. In high school, I competed extemporaneously and in dramatic interpretation. In college and graduate school, I continued to compete in various policy/oratory skills competitions and published on the art of rhetoric. Currently, I am in law school where debate skills provide the foundation for effective lawyering. 
Delivery: I may be somewhat of a traditionalist; I look for poise, clarity, tone, pause, eye contact, and body language in speaking. Voice should be commanding, confident, and fluid. Confidence can only be achieved through proper preparation, which is essential. Speed should maintain a moderate pace with proper emphasis relative to argument. Speed should never impede clarity. Effective delivery coupled with a well-supported rationale is the key to persuasiveness.
Substantive Argument: Arguments need not be numerous, but well-developed, supported by appropriate and persuasive reasoning. Rules must be applied appropriately and issues should be argued in contemplation of both affirmative and negative arguments/ counter-arguments/rebuttals. Preparation of and anticipating all angles shows a high level of skill. Cross X questions should be primarily closed in nature. Regarding strategies, I regard highly the use of 'active listening'. There is nothing more effective than using an opponent's language in a rebuttal or counter-argument against them.
