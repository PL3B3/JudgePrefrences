  I did Congressional debate for Fenwick high school then studied economics at DePaul University. I coached LD, PF, and Congress for Evanston Township High School for two years. Now I teach middle school math in East Harlem.

I'm willing to vote for anything that isn't really racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. K's are more compelling to me than traditional advocacy and theory and I like voting for interesting arguments. But I will vote on theory or traditional advocacy so long as it's well explained. Whatever you run please weigh, justify why I should evaluate your arguments, be clear about why you deserve my ballot.

I'm pretty good with speed; I'll use slow and clear if need be. Go slow on the tags. Giving a roadmap and following it will help me get down everything you're saying in an organized way.
