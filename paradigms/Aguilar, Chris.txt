  I studied philosophy at Uni Notre Dame so be careful not to distort any intentions in your cards you take from philosophers. I usually vote on well-articulated arguments that address the counterpoints with the most clarity.
Spreading is fine. I am partial to the K. Tabula Rasa. If you are not clear, you will not win. If you are dishonest, you will lose.

"The tabula of human nature was never rasa." --W.D. Hamilton
