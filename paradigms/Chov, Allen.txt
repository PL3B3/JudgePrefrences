  So I debated for 3 years at Sioux Falls Roosevelt. I am okay with speed just don't start off at full speed. I've seen zero debates on this oceans topic.

Overview
The biggest thing to good debate is obviously clash and that is what I look for in a debate. If you have clash you're already ahead of most other debaters. I also think that at the end you need to give me a reason why you should win based on an argument and how it interacts with the arguments of the other team. I don't take prep for flashing. 

T
I am a fan of topicality when the team is obviously untopical. I also think an impact calc at the end of the T debate is necessary if you are going for it. If you don't give me a method of comparing standards at the end of the round it makes it a hell of a lot harder to judge. 

Da/CP
Go for it just be sure to have specific links and interaction between the Da and case. I don't really like general links but if you explain it well enough and can do well on the argument I'll vote for it.

K
I debated the K a large amount while in debate and would say that I am open to most arguments. I am not familiar with all philosophy so be sure to explain the argument thoroughly.

Theory 
I'll vote for it but it has to show clear abuse. I have a pretty high threshold for voting for this. I will not vote for 10 second blip theory args.
