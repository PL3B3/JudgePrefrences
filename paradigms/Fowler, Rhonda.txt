Number of debates judged on the topic: 0


I am a strict policy judge, if you are a K team I probably wouldn't pref me. I judge debates based on the stock issues, I think that debates should revolve around whether or not the plan is a good idea. I like counterplans and disads for off-case but I really enjoy good case debates. Good case debates include inherency, harms, and solvency takeouts. At the end of the round I will usually vote for whichever team has the most dead bodies i.e. I default to utilitarianism. That being said, I think T and Theory are procedurals and gateway issues and it will not be hard to convince me to vote on them first.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me before the round.

Good Luck!
