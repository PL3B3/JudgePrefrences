  Linda Shipley/LD Debate
I began as a policy debater in high school and college. I’ve been coaching LD since its inception in 1980. I’ve had 3 students advance to the final round of LD at the NFL national tournament: 2001, 2010, and 2014.

I prefer classic, traditional LD with a focus on justice and/or morality. I do believe that both debaters should present a value and a criterion. 

I do believe that debate is an oral, persuasive activity. While I will always place an emphasis on the content and the development of strong, warranted arguments, I still believe that the oral component is important. Rapid speech does not prevent me from voting for a debater, but it may prevent the debater from being as persuasive as they need to be.

Pre-case observations are fine, but should be used by the debater to explain their interpretation of the resolution. 

I’m not a fan of critiques in LD. I’ve been a member of the LD wording committee for the last 7 years. The committee works diligently to frame the best possible resolutions, and I expect the debaters to actually debate them rather than to sidestep or avoid them.

I’m also not a fan of counterplans in LD; however, carefully worded alternatives are often times very effective.
