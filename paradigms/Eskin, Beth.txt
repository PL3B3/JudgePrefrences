  Beth Eskin: Coach at Timber Creek HS, Orlando for 8 years. I've judged fewer rounds than I'd like this year as I'm usually in tab but my squad is mostly PF and LD debate so I've done plenty of coaching and judging practice rounds.

I'm a relatively holistic judge. I will flow the round and listen intently. Framework is important to me and I'm going to evaluate the round from top down. While I appreciate the strategy, I abhor stacking cards in the NC and you better be able to impact and link your evidence in each of your contentions. It's not my job to make those connections. I won't necessarily intervene in the round but I also won't vote against a debater if he does not address every single card. Logic and solid argument structure is crucial. While I'm more old school, I am open to theory arguments and Ks as long as I'm not inundated with jargon. I appreciate voters. I don't love speed but I can handle it if the debater articulates. If I drop my pen, you've lost me. Delivery is almost as important less as quality of arguments, so be clear, persuasive and respectful to your opponent.
