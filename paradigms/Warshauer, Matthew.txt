  Speed - thumbs up? Just be comprehensible and signpost. If I can't understand I'll clear you once or twice.V/VC structure is preferable though not really necessary. But give me a clear understanding of how you want to conceptualize the round and please for the love of God link back to it.Theory - thumbs down. Something pretty nasty and abusive has to be going on for me to really find theory compelling. I'm a little more old school in that way, but if you do justify it I'll vote off it.
