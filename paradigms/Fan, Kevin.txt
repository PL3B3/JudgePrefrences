  Signposting is crucial. You need to make your arguments easy to follow in that regard. That said, I can tolerate a good deal of speed, but if you speak fast, you'll need to enunciate very clearly, otherwise I will miss your arguments. That said, in terms of arguments, I'm generally pretty open to everything: I do prefer it if you set up a good framework, preferably a value criterion one, but I am open to others, and please impact back to your framework. As for theory, I believe it should be used rarely, but if you feel the need to use it, you should just be able to justify its use well.
