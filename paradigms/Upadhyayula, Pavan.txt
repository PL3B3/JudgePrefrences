  I debated four years at Lynbrook High School on the local and national circuit. 

I'm cool with any argument that isn't outright offensive. At the end of the debate I like having a well warranted story that I can hold on to that will give me a reason to vote for you. I'm fine with speed, but Debate is still a speaking activity so don't just spread your ass off, persuade me as the judge.

Be chill do your thing.
