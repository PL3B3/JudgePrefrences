  2 years of judging Lincoln-Douglas Debate
I am a very, very traditional Lincoln Douglas judge. I absolutely detest the direction that this debate is going, and as a result, I will not accept the following styles of argumentation:
-Kritiks
-Disadvantages
-Plans/Counterplans

Basically, run an LD case in LD. Standards are acceptable for framework, as is the traditional value/criterion method. I will accept observations and burdens, however, all burdens MUST have warrants (ie no saying that your opponent has the burden to contradict themselves without a warrant). I understand theory, but do not accept RVI. Reasonability is how I vote on theory, but unless there is genuine abuse occurring in the round, please do not run theory.

While I respect debaters' ability to spread, I cannot guarantee being able to flow your arguments and case if you do. In other words, please don't spread.

Extensions must be clear, and tell me why it matters in the round, don't just say "extend this, extend that."

I know I sound like a complete lay judge, but LD is geared towards lay audiences. Convince me of your position!

If you respect my paradigms, you will find me to be a very, very understanding judge, and I will try my best to comprehend your case and arguments the way you want me to.

Best of luck!
