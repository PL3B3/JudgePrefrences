  Timber Creek High School '15
Rollins College '19

Definitely feel free to hit me up about any questions I don't answer on this page, either shoot me a message on Facebook or you can email me at: brandon.manbahal@gmail.com

About Me: I debated for Timber Creek on the local and national circuit for three years. I did (pretty much) exclusively LD, and I've judged an unreasonable amount of LD. I'm currently doing parliamentary debate at Rollins College, where I am a 3rd year Political Science & Philosophy double major. 

Conflicts: Timber Creek High School

Short Version: I like K's and LARP. Please please please do not exclude debaters on purpose. I will notice, and I will tank your speaks. Running three theory interps on a novice from a small school is not cool. Also, don't impact turn oppression args. Basically, just respect your opponent and be cool. We'll be fine. I evaluate T/Theory/ROTB arguments on the same level unless you tell me to do otherwise. Flex Prep is okay with me as long as it's okay with your opponent, CX is binding. Feel free to ask me about anything you need clarified before the round!

Speed: I'm pretty good with speed, if I need to yell clear/speed I will. Slow down a bit for blips/author names & tags.

Personal Preferences: Okay, so I guess this section is just for fun? If you follow this kind of stuff I'll probably be more interested and award higher speaks etc. I'll go into more detail about what I want from these arguments later on.
- K's. I love K's. You will get high speaks if you run an (effective and interesting) Cap K. This also applies to most critical theory. (Also includes MicroPol)
- LARP. Pretty sweet. Creative Plans/CP's are super interesting to me.
- Bold Strategies. If you kick the AC and read a 1AR Kritik/Go all in on the AC flow during the NC/some other wild strat, you'll get high speaks. (Assuming you are effective)
- Skep. Please don't. If you really need to do it, whatever. I'm not going to drop you because you run this, but don't. This also applies to I-Law/Polls/any other weird trick affs you found on the internet/your coach wrote for you. 
- I tend to give relatively high speaks. I think sometimes everyone forgets how amazing it is that high school students in our activity are interacting with arguments/literature that's usually reserved for graduate students. You do you, have fun.




LARP: If your link story looks like this, I will not be impressed.
 


That being said, good LARP is fun!
- I would make sure that your plan changes the status quo, and I don't default to presuming either side but I would be very open to neg presumption args in this situation.
- Perms are a test of competition in front of me
- Please do some work on the framework, I don't feel like hearing super boring and generic Bostrom args.


K Debate: My true love, the Kritik.
 
- I like K's, but that doesn't mean I'm going to fully understand the implications of your DnG/Lacan/Zizek arguments. Slow down a bit for important internal warrants/explain things more clearly than you normally would.
- Links by omission are fine by me, AS LONG AS you are explicitly justifying that the aff makes things worse for them by exclusion, etc. If you're not sure about whether or not you should use the link in front of me, use it.
- Make sure you give me a ROTB/ROTJ, if you have this you don't need a standard weighing mech.
- Weigh your ROTB against theory, I think that's really important.
- It's strategic to go further left when responding to K's in front of me. Ex. If you have to respond to a K, I'm cool with counter-k's. When going up against a performance, you don't have to have a counter-performance. Turns/indicts to the performance are sufficient.


Theory:
 


That pretty much sums it up.
- Not a fan of frivolous theory... like at all.
- I can evaluate it sufficiently, but I don't like to. Make sure you tell me if I'm evaluating under competing interps/reasonability.
- Paragraph theory is fine. Meta theory is fine. Disclosure is cool.


EDIT: Please note that it has now been a few years since I have done LD and since I wrote this paradigm. I probably will not keep up as well with your speed/12 theory args as well as I used to be able to! Just something to be cognizant of.
