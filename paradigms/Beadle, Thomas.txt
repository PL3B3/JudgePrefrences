  Head Coach of Fargo North High School since August 2005.

I judge a lot of rounds in LD, PF and some Policy (Primarily at Novice Level) and consider myself a fairly balanced judge.

My LD philosophy is simple, win the round. I encourage kids to have a Value and Criterion and use them effectively. I will not discourage any specific style of debate as long as the arguments are presented in an effective and intelligent manor. Speed will not lose you the round as long as it is used effectively (to more fully analyze arguments) and not merely as a strategy to prevent your opponent from being able to cover your issues. With speed I would still emphasize the necessity for enunciation and clarity.

I am willing to vote for whatever argument is presented the best and upheld better comparable to the opponent in the round. The biggest thing that I need to know is why an issue matters. Tell me why and impact the importance of it, and you should be able to win the round. Leaving things unsaid and not fully analyzing an issue will often lose my ballot.

Rude and Unsportsmanlike behavior will not cost you a round, but can certainly impact how I perceive you and your arguments. At the very least it can serve to cost you a speaker point or two.

Win the round, don't let me fill the gaps in for you.
