SHOULD I STRIKE THIS GUY? – I'm from Georgia.

CX – My favorite part for sure, be aggressive, and even be snarky (there’s a fine line between being entertainingly haughty and uncomfortably rude). This is the earliest time to give me the impression you’re not an emotionless robot spitting out words with your eyes glued to a computer screen. I try to be impartial, but people vote for who they like; fairness isn’t real

Plan Texts – Better have a good reason to not read them. I don’t want any fucking garbage like “you’re silencing my education”. I didn’t give up my weekends to relearn poorly explained philosophy. On the flip side, there are a ton of very persuasive non-FW neg positions against these arguments. I will reward well thought out engaging strategies.

Ks – Only entertaining if there’s a good story. Don’t waste my time with copy pasted blocks. I expect a lot of good 2ac cx questions. If you explain your k poorly, your speaker points and probably your ballot will suffer.

Conditionality – Permutations/combinations of conditional planks are actually cancer.

T - I have not judged on the China topic. I don't even know what the resolution is actually.

Final Thoughts – I think it’s a shame how current policy debate rewards rhetorical skills and technicalities rather than in depth knowledge about actual policies. Mindlessly reading cards and the utility of generic criticisms and counterplans do not help counteract this. People also get way too salty over losses. It reminds me of Sachin K when he plays league of legends. You people need to enjoy yourselves.

Don't be boring.

Will give extra speaks if you prove to me you post full cites (underlining AND highlighting). Tell me after the 2AR.
