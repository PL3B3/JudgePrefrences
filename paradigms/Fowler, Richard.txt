   Hello my name is Richard Fowler and I have debated for 5 years (4 years in High School @ Fort Lauderdale High and 1 year in college at the George Washington University). I am a graduate of GWU and  have two bachelors degrees a B.S in Economics and a B.A in International Affairs. I really enjoy the debate community and take it really seriously. I am pretty much open to everything, I must add I have judged anything rounds on the 2008-2009 topic. I am ok with speed as long as you are clear and you slow down on the tags. With that said here are a few key thing to know: 

1) If you are going for T, please be sure to explain why not being topical is a bad this 
2) The K: If you are running a critique please be sure that you explain the firm work 
3) Theory: Please be sure to have a well developed Theory argument and explain why I should vote on it. 
4) Have fun and respect your opponent!
