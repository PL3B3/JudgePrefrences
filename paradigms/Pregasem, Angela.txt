  As of Harvard Invitational, 2012:

This is my first year judging LD. Thus, I prefer a conversational pace. I will say SLOWER if you are going too fast but don’t rely on it because it may affect your speaks. 

I will judge the round in how you explain to me your positions and how it interacts with the resolution. I prefer you use the normal value/VC structure because I am most familiar with that. This also means I prefer more topical positions. 

When it comes to kritikal arguments, please don’t run them. I do not have any experience in such philosophy and thus won’t understand it probably. Further, don’t run too complicated positions unless you can explain them with ease. 

Don’t run theory, however, if your opponent is being abusive, explain to me how we should evaluate the round instead, not how I should punish them. 

I average around 27/27.5 speaks and will reward you for a strong performance. 

Most Important: Give me voting issues. That’s the only I can make a clear decision. I don't want a muddled debate.

Further, I will dock speaks for any new arguments in the 2AR.
