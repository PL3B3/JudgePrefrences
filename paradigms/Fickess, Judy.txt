  *TO DEBATERS AT ASU* I AM NOT OPPOSED TO YOU BRINGING ME CHICK FIL A
I'm Judy and I participated in 4 years of LD debate for The Meadows School. I currently attend Wellesley College. 
Short Version: 
"If you have no h8rs, you are doing something wrong." Tim Alderete
K's and Policy style arguments in general are Kool
I have a higher threshold for bad theory "This probably means you think Iâ€™m 'Interventionist.'"
However I do not mind theory debates as long as they are good theory debates (i.e. pls don't run date theory in front of me)
"I can handle the speed"
Long version:
I like K's but if you don't understand it don't run it. If you can't explain it then there's no way your opponent or I will understand, thus I'm more likely to drop you. As the god himself Tim Alderete says, "Good K debates are some of the best debates I've ever judged. Bad K debates are some of the worst debates I've judged."
I won't extend arguments for you. When you extend your arguments you must explain the warrant or else I won't give you credence. For example, if you were to extend Lil B 2014 you would need to explain why he is in fact paris hilton. 
Also I accept bribes (not really but good 4 ethos okay)
