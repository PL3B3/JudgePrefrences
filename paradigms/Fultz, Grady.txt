TOP LEVEL:
*Email chains work best (if there's is wifi) and put me on it - fultzgrady071@gmail.com
*Speed - Go as fast as you are capable
*Don't steal prep
*Always time your own speeches, opponents' speeches, and prep. I will too but it is good habit.
*Prep stops when you send the email or when the speech is saved to the flash drive
*No place for pre-written blocks that are longer than a minute. Overviews are fine, but but don't waste time reading some block from a debate 6 tournaments ago. Tailor your arguments to this round.
*Impact calc must be comparative 

AFF:
Know your aff. Feel free to run any affirmative you like whether it be critical or policy. I ran mostly policy affirmatives but have heavy experience with both.
T - I am sympathetic to reasonability if you defend it well

NEG:
Run anything you wish. Know your offcase just as well as you know your oncase evidence and know them well.
T - If you have a good violation, internal link, and impact go for it
CP - Have a solvency advocate, defeat permutations, and have a strong net-benefit
K - Feel free to run what you wish. If you use a ton of buzzwords and don't communicate your arguments well, I will be sad and it will take me longer to make a decision. If you're going to be a debater who runs Ks, be a good one.
Disads - Turns case arguments are good to have and I enjoy them.

PET PEEVES:
Be a competitor. Harsh comments that have nothing to do with winning the debate WILL impact your speaker points.

CX:
It is meaningful, therefore I will pay close attention to it.
