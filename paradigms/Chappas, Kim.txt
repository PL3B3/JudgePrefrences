  Background: I debated Lincoln-Douglas at Spirit Lake High School (IA) from 1998-2002. I judged during college, from 2002-2005.
Currently: Coaching at Okoboji (IA)

I like a traditional LD round--no theory or K. If I wanted to judge policy, I would. I expect cases to have a proper value and criterion and to follow the standard LD format. Everything should be topical--do not go off on a tangent about minutiae that has nothing to do with the resolution, because you will not win. I love philosophy, as it seems to be a lost art among many debaters. Speed is not a quality I value in a round. I want to hear clear, well-articulated arguments, not speed reading and the accompanying gasps for air. I also expect both debaters to stand for all speeches and CX.

Other things to consider:
*I come from the era before computers, so I don't care if your computer is experiencing technical difficulties. I start your prep time when you sit down. Have paper copies of everything you need in case of a computer malfunction, because I will not reset the time for you. On the same token, I expect any sharing of files to be done either before the round or during your prep time. Do not waste my time asking to share files before you start your prep time, because the answer will be no.
*Preflowing should also be done before the round, hence the name. Do not ask for time to do this. I expect a round to start as soon as all parties are in the room and set up.
*Another note about time: When my timer goes off, finish your thought then stop speaking. If you continue your speech well after time I will note it on your ballot and will lower your speaker points. Also, when your prep time is up, it's up. Stand up and start your speech. If you abuse your prep time, the same consequence applies. I have no problem with you timing yourself during the round, but be advised that my timer is the only one that counts.
*I dislike rude and/or condescending debaters. Be assertive, especially in CX, but don't demean the other person.
