  Background: My name is Natasha Henley and I graduated from Thurgood Marshall High School in 2006. I did L.D. Debate, Stu. Co. as well as I.E.'s for two years with my team. My junior year I went to state in El Paso for Student Congress and during my senior year I made L.D. Captain of my team. I've attended Our Lady of The Lake University and I'm currently attending North Central Texas College. My goal is to finish with a B.A. in English and later want to attend Law School.
  
 This Year: I have judged 10 L.D. rounds and 1 Extemp. I look forward to judging more in the future. I try my hardest when I have time, it's just with work and school I have a busy schedule.
 Value/Value Criterion: I really enjoy when these two things have some kind of connection. To me, they're like two pieces of a puzzle that should connect together to be the foundation of your case. They set the case up for Contentions, Tag Lines, Evidence, and Definitions amongst everything else that follows.
 Paradigms: I don't judge C.X. rounds so in L.D. you don't have to speed like it is one. I like when people slow down, take their time and let me actually enjoy what they're saying. Road maps, definitions, as well as using prep time are a plus when it comes to me, it lets me know that you actually have a plan towards winning the round. I'm not too big on oral critiques, one will usually know what I thought when they receive their ballot back. Other then that, I love to hear cases and overall feel that I'm a very fair judge. If a case is too hard to decide the winner, then for me it usually comes down to the best evidince, and expression of definitions throughout ones case.
