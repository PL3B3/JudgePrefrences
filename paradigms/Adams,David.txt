  I debated at Deer Park High School in Houston, Texas and at the University of Texas at Dallas. I help the Deer Park debate team when I can. I won't put alot because all I need to say is that I vote for what I'm told. It is the debaters job to tell me how to evaluate a round and then prove to me that they have won in that context. I will literally vote for anything that is explained and impacted. When debaters fail to explain or impact then I am forced to intervene and inject some of my beliefs and views in my decision and I don't want to do that. I do have a high threshold for critique alternatives, even if an affirmative were to drop the alternative in the 2AC I still must have some explanation from the block exactly how the alternative solves the impact. Other than that I'm an open book.
