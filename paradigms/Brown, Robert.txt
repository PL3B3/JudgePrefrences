I am Adam Brown's (Episcopal AB) father. I will be judging VLD and JVLD at the Glenbrooks 2015 tournament for Episcopal High School. I want a meaningful and clean debate. I do not want excessive rudeness. Please do not use any debate jargon or speak quickly, as I will most likely not understand you. Do not assume that I know or understand the common arguments they make just because they are present in the debate meta. I understand that the framework debate is integral to my decision. I want you to make arguments that function under the winning framework in the round. I will inform both debaters of my decision after the round and will assign speaker points based on clarity and persuasiveness. Feel free to ask any questions! I'm looking forward to a fun weekend!
