  I am in my first year of judging Lincoln-Douglas debate. However, I have years of experience judging and evaluating students and adults in a variety of competitive settings.

 I do flow the debate, although my flow may not always say what you want it to say. I will do my best to follow you, but may not track speedy or overly complex debate. Best to keep to 200 words per minute since I may focus on individual words and not your flow beyond that pace. I have a relatively traditional paradigm and should not be expected to vote on theoretical argumentation explained with more than a minimum amount of jargon, pre-standards voting issues, or critiques.

When assigning speaker points, I look to respect, fluidity, tone, and courtesy. Interesting and clearly well-thought-out positions will be rewarded. Offensive arguments will be punished. My displeasure is simply expressed in the ballot in most rounds.

 Finally, I prefer to write comments on the ballot instead of orally disclosing.
