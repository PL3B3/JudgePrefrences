  I currently teach two courses in the Religious Studies Department: Ethic, Culture & Justice in El Salvador and Vocation & Discernment. I have a BS in Environmental Science, a BA in Religious Studies, and an MA in Pastoral Ministry all from Santa Clara University. 

Experience: This is my first year coaching debate and assisting specifically with the LD events.

Philosophy: I value clarity and depth in an argument. It is the debaters job to demonstrate to me that they have spent a great deal of time thinking and researching their topic and appropriately showcasing what they know. I would much prefer to hear fewer, yet stronger arguments than several quickly laid out and shallow points.
