  I am a freshman at Harvard College and have been involved in debate for five years. In Minnesota, I was involved in the Classic Debate style.

Frames and Impact
Saying evidence is not enough without emphasis on the impact or frame of the argument. The stronger the frame and impact, the better the arguments. Evidence is also necessary to support you ideas and logic but frames are important. Make sure to emphasis the so-what factor of evidence and logic? Weight the impact of your arguments versus that of your opponents.

Counterplans
I tend to be against counterplans, although alternatives that are viable can be brought up, I refrain from favoring counterplan heavy cases as it is nearly impossible for the aff to come up with every counterplan to defend.

Speaker Points
Make sure to maintain eye contact, posture, and present your arguments as eloquently as possible. Speaking skills, roadmaps, transitions, and sign pointing are just as important as the arguments.

Other Notes
Remember to both break down your opponents case while building up your case. Be sure to emphasis impact.
Be punctual with prep-time.
Mark your cards.
Balance speed and clarity.
Be sassy and classy. You can be aggressive but within reason and maintaining respect.
Explain any important acronyms.
