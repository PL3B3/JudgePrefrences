  I. Introduction
I have been judging policy debate for the last two years. I did not participate in debate during high school or college, translation- I am a lay judge. Now before you sneer me, please continue to read my philosophy.

I have a decent working knowledge of the 2010-11 policy topic.

II. Philosoph
Each round is a chance to win me over. I have no preconceived notions regarding the round.

III. Specific Issues

A. Topicality
Affirmatives should address the topic, while you may be able to convince me otherwise.

B. Counterplans
Solid CP's that outweigh the aff can absolutely win me over. Take the time for the line by line and tell the story. CP's done well bring about great rounds. 

C. Disadvantages
I am open here as well. 

D. Kritiks
Run the K any way that you see fit. If you can convince me your argument is better, you win.

III. Speaker Evaluations
Spreading is fine as long as you clearly sign post the points you are going to make before you make them. If your speaking is not clear and I can not understand you, I will call "clear". If you fail to communicate clearly to me as your judge, how can you possibly expect me to make any decision at all? The best round I have ever judged was the Harvard 2009 Varsity Semis. The reason this round sticks out is that the speaker spread the fastest I have ever heard in my 2 years, yet he also stopped, looked over to the judges panel and clearly explained what he was covering. I am a sucker for a clear and crisp speaker every time.
