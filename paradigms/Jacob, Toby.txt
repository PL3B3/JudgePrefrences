  Debated for: Littleton High School '06 - '10
Debate for: Georgetown University '10 -

This isn't going to be an extensive judge philosophy but here are a few things to note:

1. I worked at a camp this summer so I have some experience on this topic. That being said, I haven't kept up with the topic since camp so an extra layer of explanation for super awesome counter-plans or some spicy hot disad may be required.

2. I'm comfortable hearing most arguments in a debate. I feel like the main areas I wouldn't feel qualified to judge (as much as a first year out can be qualified), would be performative arguments and certain kritiks.
Note: I know a lot of K debaters hate hearing this but, I like it when Kritiks are run like disads. I mainly read generic kritiks in high school like biopower, cap, reps, etc. I'm probably not the best judge for anything beyond that.

3. Analytic arguments are great. Smart arguments and questions can destroy the risk of your opponent's ultra-hyper-uber-secret Thursday File DA

4. StarCraft jokes are good

5. StarCraft 2 jokes are better

6. Have fun, be smart, be clear.

P.S. Yes, I am the debate partner of the infamous Peter Vale. And yes, college tournaments now allow Peter Vale to give 10 minute 1ARs because he is so slow.
