Judging Description
I'm a parent judge with mainly experience in JV. That said, I can flow but not well enough to handle speed so SLOW DOWN if I am judging otherwise I will not understand you and you will probably lose. I'm okay with most arguments that I've heard so far, but you're probably better off running stock in front of me. Please weigh arguments and give me a very easy way to adjudicate the round. If you don't, I'll probably have to intervene and you probably won't be happy. In the end, debate is a game, so smile and have fun and we'll all be okay.
