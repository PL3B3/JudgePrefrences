  Experience: I debated all four years of high school in Public Forum and Lincoln-Douglas debate. I also competed in Congress, Original Oratory, Domestic Extemp, and Impromptu.

Judging Philosophy:
Speed – I do not take well to spreading because it takes away from the art of speaking in debate. This will tie directly to your speaker points.
Speaker Points – Speaker points rely on how clearly you speak, how confidently you present your case, and whether you’re respectful to your opponent(s).
Turns – I enjoy turns quite a bit and I think they give your arguments more weight.
Counterplans – I don’t mind counterplans too much, but make sure you debate the core of the resolution.
Framework – Personally, I like framework debates. What I don’t like is extensive focus on definition debates.
Signpost and Roadmapping – SIGNPOST. It will make sure I hear your taglines and can follow the train of thought of your arguments. Roadmapping will also help frame your speech.
Impacts – Impacts are the main thing I vote off of. If you don’t have impacts to your argument, I’ll have to decide how much your argument weighs in the round.
Topicality – I don’t mind topicality debates. I think it’s important to refer back to the resolution often.
Kritiks – Kritiks are ok, just make sure you explain them clearly.

Otherwise I come into the round with an open mind and I rely on you to convince me of your side. I don’t flow questions, but I’m listening. I flow everything else in the round.
