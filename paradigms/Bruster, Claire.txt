Hi! I am currently a parliamentary debater for Columbia Debate Society. I was a PF debater for Anderson High School (class of 2017).

This is my first time judging Lincoln Douglas. I will vote on any argument but because of my experience in PF, I am not comfortable with extremely fast spreading in LD rounds. Please give a clear road map, slow down, and give thorough overviews and crystallization. I will not vote on any argument I do not catch in its entirety in the first speech, so it’s to your advantage to err heavily toward clarity over speed.

Things to give you bonus speaks:
Being funny and interestingClear framing
If you make silly arguments, you’ll make me sad and will probably lose.

Please be nice to one another (and me) and have fun!
