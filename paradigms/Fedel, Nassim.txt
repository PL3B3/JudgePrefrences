  I did policy debate for four years at Palo Alto High School in Palo Alto, CA.


LD Judge Philosophy:

Speaking Style: Iâ€™m fine with speed. However, please make sure to be clear, especially on taglines and authors.

Framework: Whatever you want.

Theory/T: I default to competing interpretations, but would much rather prefer there to be a debate about competing interpretations versus reasonability. I do not default to theory being an RVI, but I am receptive to arguments to that end.

Kritiks: Whatever you want, as long as the argumentation is logical and substantiated.

Performances: Completely fine with me. Please make arguments about the role of the ballot. Good performance rounds can be some of my favorite.

A Prioris: Fine.

Policy Arguments: Plans, Counterplans, Disads, etc are fantastic.
