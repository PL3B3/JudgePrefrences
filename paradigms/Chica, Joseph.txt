  I was a four year L.D. debater for Christopher Columbus high school. I debated on the local and national circuit regularly, so you can do what ever. I was more of a traditional debater but I love K’s and CP’s. That being said, if it’s a dense philosophy I’m not familiar with you need to explain it to me (don’t cut corners assuming I know what you’re talking about) if you do, I won’t vote on it. Speeds alright but slow down for tags and on voters. Generally, I don’t want to see a round where one debater just out spreads another. I’m nice about speaks and if you can make me laugh I’m more inclined to round up. I’m not a huge theory guy so if your A strat is just reading a few shells then pref me a 3 or a 4. I love traditional debate so if you’re a traditional debater pref me. I love debate, it’s about having fun, so relax! You’ll debate better if you do.
