  Background:
I am a high school English (sophomores, juniors, seniors, AP English Language) and humanities/philosophy teacher in Los Alamos, NM. I am technically a lay judge, with no formal debate background, but I do have argumentation and analysis background. I may not know all of the vernacular, but I do know who has the more compelling case and who has carried the flow.

Yes:
Solid organization and clear cases to build your arguments. Rhetorical flourishes. Eye contact. Humility and practice. Adaptation.

No:
As a newer judge, spreading will not impress me so much as make it harder for all of your quality points to be heard and weighed. In other words, I am not ideologically opposed to spreading, but your main objective should be to clearly communicate your arguments; therefore, if you cease to be effective in your communication, you have defeated the objective.
