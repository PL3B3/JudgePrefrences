I debated for Monticello High School in New York for four years (2008-2012). I did Policy from '08-'09, and later competed in LD and PF on the national circuit. During High School and since graduating I have judged Policy, LD, and PF. Currently, I'm a Loyola University New Orleans student double majoring in Business Management and Sociology.

I'll keep this brief.

In any event, LD, PF, and even in the off chance I'm judging Policy:
Things that will help you include:
- Being on time
- Reading and speaking clearly. Speed is only an issue for me if you're unclear. Slow down for important points. Don't expect me to say "clear". Debaters should be attentive to their judge and if I'm not following you you can surely expect me to have a "bitchy resting face". Look it up.
- Having unique and well supported arguments
- Using cross examination in a useful, amusing way
- Making relevant jokes 
- Having a respectful, light-hearted demeanor 

Things that may hurt you (in terms of speaker points, not necessarily ballot count) include:
- Being late
- Speaking unclearly or unnecessarily fast. I loathe debaters who use speed just to one-up their opponent or prove an ability to speak fast. If you spread and have a significant portion of time remaining at the end of your speech I will likely deduct speaker points...or add time to the cross ex if I so choose.
- Reading the same argument your whole team is reading...or worse, the same argument/evidence everyone else is reading and presenting it in a non-nuanced way
- Making elitist, racist, sexist, (insert other marginalized group here -ist) jokes. Note my major in Sociology.
- Being disrespectful to myself, your opponents, or anyone else

Other than that, crystallization and specifically engaging your arguments with your opponent's will do both you and me a huge service in round. Exceptional weighing analysis will make my job a lot easier and your speaker points/ballot count higher. 

Good luck!
