High School: Barstow
College: Colgate University

I debated for Barstow for four years and qualified to the TOC, however I do not debate policy in college. I judged a few practice rounds this summer, but my topic knowledge is pretty limited.

Things to do -- 

1. Slow down/speak clearly. Fewer/better/longer cards, more explanation. Make a distinction between tag, text, and analytical arguments. 

2. Start the 2nr or 2ar with what the first 10-15 seconds of the decision would sound like. 

3. More case, it's clash-filled and engaging. No ev on the case? Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say; I love analytical arguments. 

4. Tell me what evidence to read and why. I value ev quality greatly but don't read much unless it's contested.

Other things:
I debated policy in high school but am open to other styles of debate. However, I think the topic should be used at least as a starting point for the round- what that looks like is up to you. Always love a DA and CP debate. 


Kritiks: I have a decent knowledge of the typical ones. If your strategy is going to be one-off or an obscure kritik be prepared to do some explaining. Regardless of the type, have an actual link. Links of omission are not links. I do find arguments like case OW compelling, but neg can win V2L claims if done with proper detail. 

Theory: Still have yet to hear a good reason that makes sense for conditionality, especially when used in conjunction with contradictory arguments. If you plan on going for condo, make it a real thing in the 2ac, not just 10 blippy sentences. 

Counterplans: 
I don't know much about any topic specific counter plans. There should be a solvency advocate for your CP. Literature checks most abuse in response to theory, teams should be rewarded if they are able to find a specific counter plan to your aff.
