I will be a fourth year undergraduate at UCLA, but have four years of experience in high school varsity debate. Although I am not participating in college debate, I try to stick around in the community. Also, because I have not done a lot of research on this topic, please explain new acronyms .

I ran both policy and critical arguments, therefore I do not have a preference. Nevertheless, I have never been fond of performance debates. Regardless, I will still vote for a performance team as long as there is a clear framework and an explanation of what an affirmative vote means.

By the end of the round, both the 2NR and 2AR should provide a global overview with comparative impact analysis by framing the round i.e. why you should win the round and what does it mean if I vote for your arguments. I will not vote for tagline extensions therefore both teams must have clash. I do not usually call for cards because it is the debaterâ€™s responsibility to explain their evidence and why their evidence is more qualified and better than the opponent's. 

I am fine with speed but if you are not clear, I will not flow your arguments. I would prefer debaters to slow down on tags and authors.

Speaker points will be awarded based on strategy and argumentation.
