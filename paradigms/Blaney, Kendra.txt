  I competed in LD and PF at McNeill High School in Austin, Tx. 

I am very progressive when it comes to speed and technical arguments. I always prefer a substance debate over a K or theory. But I love counter plans and plan affs. 

I will say clear but if I dont understand you after that I can't vote for something I didnt hear or couldnt understand.
