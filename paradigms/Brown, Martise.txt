  Introduction

First lets start off with my debate experience! I have debated for 5 years in high school and middle school! I currently debate on the college level at Towson University. I have also taught debate with in Baltimore City to three different schools and have led my teams to victory for over 2 years. So therefore, I would assume that I know the tricks of the trade. However, there are always new and/or improving arguments that evolve over the years. This is why Learning never ends!

Philosophy

I am a very liberal judge. I will listen to all arguments, so long as each argument is justified, and explained throughout the debate! Depending on the debate itself,I evaluate the round based on what the debater tells me to judge on, meaning framework is a plus! Arguments such as Kritik's, DA's, Counter Plans, and Topicality are all good arguments to run. But if there is no sufficient offense and/or defense on the flow, then I am more inclined not to vote on it!

As regards to speed! I am a good flow judge, however I am not a recorder...I will not catch every single word/argument you make if you are trying to talk at me at 90 miles an hour, so clarity is a must! So i suggest that you start off at a slower pace and pick up speed throughout your speech. I will say "clear" if i need you to slow down. Art (music, poetry, spoken word, and/or instruments) are welcome in debate rounds with me, so long as you explain their significance within the debate, the debate community, or your with in your argument! However, If your art or words that are used against the other team are blatantly disrespectful, I WILL NOT hesitate to severely take off of your speaker points.

Conclusion

 But with all this said, have a great debate round and if you have any questions, just ask! Most times my email address will be included on the ballot, if i remember to put it there!
