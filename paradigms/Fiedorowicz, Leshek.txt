  I am a parent judge setting this philosophy for the Cal Invitational. 

I will not comprehend spreading, but I am in my fourth year of judging. 

Keep arguments interesting and logical. Complex arguments are fine too, however be slow enough just that I can understand it. I am an engineer, so my knowledge of things such as philosophy is limited but I am open-minded.
