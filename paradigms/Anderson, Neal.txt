Be yourself: relaxed, prepared, focused.
I look for a few, well crafted arguments, with clear impact. What is so significant about the reasons you present?
Reasons, reasons, reasons: are the arguments you are making the most weighty, the most significant?
Showcase where you are headed (great off time road maps help me realize up front where you are headed).
Too many random, unrelated ramblings are not well received.
Tell me what you are going to tell me, then tell me, then tell me what you told me.
Key Preferences and Beliefs
Clarity is important.
Being well prepared is important.
Being kind and respectful to your opponent is important.
Judging Style
I flow using a template (which I will be happy to show you), making a few notes as you speak, circling significant impacts as you state them clearly. I do not disclose unless specifically asked to do so by the tournament directors. I feel that you will see who won soon enough and part of disclosing is offering constructive criticism (which is tough for me). I most always find something about your presentation that I liked and express that constructively. Do more of what you are good at, and less of what you are not good at is my philosophy. Most tournaments are on a tight schedule, but, if I see you in the hall, and have time, I will be happy to share some ideas with you.
I am very fortunate to be associated with you wonderful, positive, young people, desirous of making positive changes to your community.
