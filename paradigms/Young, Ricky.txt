  Hello.
I was a varsity debater for St. Vincent's high school during the '12-'13 season and the '13-'14 season. I qualified for the TOC twice and you shouldn't really care about anything else that happened during my high school career.
I am a freshman debating at UNLV

Don’t change your strategy because I’m judging. I will vote for who wins. Go with what your good at.

If you read a critical aff or a K make sure you tell me what my role is and what the role of the ballot is so I know how to evaluate the round.
If you are reading framework know that I am persuaded by topical version of the aff. I will vote on FW just as easily as I will vote on the K- just like ya know win.
