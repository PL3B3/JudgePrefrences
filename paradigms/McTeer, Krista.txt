  I have judged for approximately 3 years. I want to hear a clear resolutional analysis with contentions fully supporting your RA. Your contentions need to contain relevant empirical evidence. I like a strong cross, with questions that will provide excellent clash. Support your case and take down your opponent's case. Final speeches should contain specific voters. Tell me why you think you won. Stay true to your debate format. I don't want to hear policy critiques in Lincoln Douglas.
