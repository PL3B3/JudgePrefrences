  I have absolutely no background in formal debate, however I have watched The Great Debaters. I can't really handle speed, I much prefer a clear and colloquial pace. Because I am not very familiar with Lincoln Douglas debate, I am not familiar with debating jargon. I have taken several philosophy courses as an undergraduate at Harvard, so I can appreciate a well-reasoned and explained stances and rebuttals.
