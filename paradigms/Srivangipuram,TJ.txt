  I debated in high school for four years and have debated sporadically at Cal for the past 2.5. 
I am fine with most arguments (Ks, Theory, etc.) and will vote for whichever team impacts their arguments and explains why they win better. The link story is also crucial.
Important: It should be noted that as of 2/19/2011, I have not judged a debate on this year's high school topic, so be aware of that when you're dropping very topic-specific technical terms. 

Topicality: I generally default to competing interpretations, but the neg needs to impact their standards well for me to pull the trigger. 
Kritiks: I consider myself decently well versed in some of the greatest hits, but be sure to provide detailed, AFF-SPECIFIC link analysis and a concrete explanation of what the alt actually means. I generally default to allowing affs to weigh their impacts against Ks unless told otherwise, and expect a thorough "K turns case" or other impact analysis debate.
Disads: I love a good politics (or any good DA really) debate. Comparison of evidence (warrants/authors/etc.) will be appreciated. Affs probably need offense to beat the DA, but great defense will make a difference as well.
Counterplans: Are awesome. Texts and net benefits should be clear, as should permutations.
Theory: Is cool, but you've gotta impact it and explain why I should reject the team for me to vote on it. I'll usually just reject the argument unless clear, impacted analysis is provided for me to vote the other team down.
Case: Aff, you read a 1ac, be sure to use it. nifty applications of 1ac ev/args will be appreciated.

Evidence comparisons should be done in round, not as I'm making a decision. please impact dropped arguments. other than that, do what ya need to do.
