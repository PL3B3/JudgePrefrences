  I debated Ld and dabbled in Pf for 4 years at Cherry Creek High School and competed primarily locally but made it to a number of circuit tournaments. I'm a Sophomore in college and this is my second year judging. While I haven't judged this topic before I've done my research. As far as argumentation goes I really don't have many preferences as long as you're clear and IMPACT. I don't mind critical arguments or CPs at all as long as you know what you're talking about and they're not too much of a stretch.That being said, unless you're running a K I'll vote first off VALUES. What makes LD unique is value structure so I expect all arguments to link in to your value structure. If both sides have the same values then I'll look to standards and who links into the value best. I can handle some speed if you're using it to fit in more legitimate arguments but I won't go for any speed if you're using it just as a time sink or to fluster your opponent. There are great slow rounds and there are great quicker rounds. Overall, you can use pretty much any type or argumentation you want as long as it has substance; I'll vote on what is presented to me but I prefer to pick up debaters on quality arguments rather than minor details or technical arguments. Don't go new in the two.
