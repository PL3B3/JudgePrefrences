Judge Philosophy—First one of these, so bear with me, I’ll try and go point by point:

Arguments: Say what you want, if I believe you mean it that’s better. Feel free to do weird stuff as long as you seem to have a point or at least good ethos, and always try and understand your arguments and know what you’re talking about. Also, fair warning, I probably have a higher than average threshold for pulling the trigger on T or theory, if there’s in round abuse then go for it but if potential abuse is your only voter, it better be damn severe.

Delivery: Fast, slow, conversational, interpretive dance, whatever, as long as I can understand what you’re saying. I’m going to try and flow what you say, but if I can’t make out your words it won’t end up on the flow, which means it won’t be evaluated. If I can’t understand you I’ll probably say “clearer” once, max twice. Past that it’s on you. Other than that, good delivery and strong ethos will get you speaks, but is no substitute for actually winning the argument.

Other: Don’t be an asshole, time yourselves, try not to take too long flashing, have all your stuff on hand. I don’t take prep time for flashing speeches but if you abuse this privilege I will take it away. Obviously don’t cheat. Basically don’t do anything that makes me think you’re a bad person and we shall get along beautifully.
