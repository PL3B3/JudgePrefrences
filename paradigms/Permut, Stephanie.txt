  4 years of high school policy debate; 1 year local, 3 years national
I was a policy debater for four years in high school and qualified to the TOC three times. I chose not to debate in college but have remained engaged with both policy and LD since then. I am currently a part-time coach for Eastside Catholic.

I have not judged LD in more than a year, so I may not be aware of cutting-edge community trends or vocabulary. That said, I will try to evaluate debates in the frameworks offered by the competitors rather than intervening with my own views. The best debaters will give final speeches that explicitly articulate how I should write my ballot, not just whether you are right about your positions.
