  Background: I debated for four years at Robbinsdale Cooper High School, and am currently on my sixth year assistant-coaching at that same location. I was coached by DJ Brynteson and Amber Windschitl . i coach with emilia spalding and chy-chy thibodo. my thoughts are generally in line with those of these four. especially regarding backflips.

this got too wordy so here:

i want to hear an audible gap between the words streaming out of your mouth and if any one of them is 'theory' i'll probably just fill your losing ballot out early and leave.

also, i'm doing my personal best to combat speaker point inflation, so don't be offended when i give your perfectly average performance a 25.

if you are physically capable of standing you'd better do it. 
...or else.
