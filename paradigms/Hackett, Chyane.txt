Personal Preferences:
Speed is fine, but make sure to adjust your speaking if I say "clear"
Make sure there is clash and impact calculus during the round, even on flows other than a disad. 
I prefer a disad/cp/case debate, but kritiks are fine as long as they're well explained. 
Make sure you are professional when debating, and be nice to each other in the round. 

Topicality - I have a high threshold for topicality arguments, make sure the violation is clearly articulated. I favor reasonability over competing interpretations, but can be convinced otherwise with good arguments in the round.

Theory - Make sure a framework is clearly articulated. I think conditionality is a reason to reject the team, but default to "reject the argument" on other theoretical issues. Feel free to debate otherwise in the round. 

Any other questions? Ask before the round!
