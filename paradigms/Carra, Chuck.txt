  I am smart, engaged, and interested in making a good decision. Please go slow and explain things clearly, as I do not have much experience with spreading (or tolerance for unclear arguments). 

Also, another coach has this to say about me: Chuck is a revolutionary dude, and will stand up to/for anyone, and loves it when kids have fun and approach topics in unusual ways, and loves it more when kids understand that the world is a tough and sinister place. He has tattoos, so strike him if you can't handle the sight of ink. He has judged LD a lot now.
