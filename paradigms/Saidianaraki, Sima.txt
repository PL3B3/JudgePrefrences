  I have been judging policy for one year as a parent judge.
I like it when arguments are very clearly explained to me.
Explain to me why I should be voting for you.
I am not 100% familiar on the criteria that are debated upon, so explain them as you come upon them or I will not understand your argument.
SPEAK SLOWLY PLEASE, or I won't be able to flow and understand your arguments, forcing me to give you a loss.
