I debated and judged LD in high school and have done a some high school judging since in both LD and PFD. I will do a detailed flow and find for whoever convinces me that that they have won the round.

LD is values debate and I would prefer to judge it as such; citing evidence only helps when you provide analysis of how it supports your V/VC, and I would be perfectly happy finding for a debater who has provided no citations at all if their argumentation is convincing. Spreading detracts from values clash and makes for boring rounds. Good signposting on both sides allows the debate to come down to the arguments and will be much appreciated.
