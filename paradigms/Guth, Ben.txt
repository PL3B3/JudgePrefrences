  I am a Lexington High School alum who debated four years of policy.

I attempt to intervene as little as possible but often that requires the help of the debaters in the round meaning give me well-reasoned and argued rationale for my ballot, don't just throw arguments at the wall and see what sticks. That often happens with theory debates where I prefer fewer and better warranted arguments that tons of small blippy voting issues.

My judging philosophy is fairly neutral towards most arguments. Although I wasn't much a kritik debater in high school, I have voted for kritiks before so I am not generally prejudiced against them. I'm fairly neutral on all issues topicality; I don't necessarily favor one side over the other. For performance debaters; I have to be honest, its not really my cup of tea but if you justify your basis for debate, I'll listen though in my opinion, debate is meant to test the merits of the resolution and sidestepping that issue is not the way to go.

Lastly, speed is fine but clarity is important. Please maintain a clean line-by-line so that I can stay organized. You don't have to be too formal in front of me but please respect everyone in the room and don't act rudely.
