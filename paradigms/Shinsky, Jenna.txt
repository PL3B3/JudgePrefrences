  I debated policy in high school for four years at Massillon Perry High School with 99% of my tournaments being in the OHSSL district. 2015/16 will be my first year judging varsity debate. I've gone to one national circuit tournament and to the NDT twice.

-I'm tabula rasa, but prefer in-depth policy making debates. And since no one is truly "tab" i'll explain further-
Topicality : I prefer it not to be used as a time suck. Run it if you actually think they're untopical
Kritiques : I was never a K debater myself in HS, but my partner was so I'll still vote for it. We ran cap, bio-power, and life-affirming nihilism. I come from a school that also runs various different fem Ks which are my favorite debates to hear. I LOVE rhetoric/reps Ks.
CPs: : Obviously do a lot of work on CP solvency and NB. I really do not like PICs. It will take a lot of persuading to get me to vote up a PIC.
DAs: : Not a huge fan of generic DAs but I understand sometimes it's the only option. At least make your spending debate fun and interesting. Case outweighs are a must.
Theory : Not the biggest fan, but i'll still evaluate it if brought up in the round. Do not just read your block in the rebuttals- point for point clash is important.
-Speed is fine, but don't risk speed for clarity.
- I love a CLEAN flow. Numbering and organization make the life of a judge so much easier.
-Presentation is important to me. Being rude to your partner/opponents will result in speaker point deduction. I'm not asking for a serious and stiff round- humor at times is okay, but debaters sometimes forget this IS a professional activity and that we need to treat one another kindly and act somewhat professional. I get really upset if I find a team being rude to one another.
- I do not like tag-team cross-ex. I find it ONLY acceptable if you find your partner says something that may lose you the round.
- No prep-time for jumping.

- Avoid gendered language also. I won't vote you down but I also don't like whenever an entire room is referred to as "you guys", especially when there are people who identify as female in the room. Just a personal preference.

Side-note : If you can incorporate our energy grid into the debate while it still being germaine i'll be completely interested. I ran energy affs three out of the four years I debated and am pursuing an eventual job for the department of Energy.


Feel free to ask any specific questions before the round if this does not suffice/ the tournament paradigm is lacking.

Also feel free to email me  if you have any questions about RFDs.
