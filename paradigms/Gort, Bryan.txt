I debated for four years at Pace Academy and three years at Kentucky. I judged this year at the ohio valley tournament.

I like to let debaters make their arguments and try to stick to the flow. I usually resolve topicality in terms of competing interpretations but can be persuaded otherwise. Pretty much anything is up for debate.

Disads - Like to hear these debates, please make impact comparisons to make my job easier.

Counterplans - I tend to lean pretty negative on counterplan theory issues. If abuse is shown and you win your arguments i can be persuaded to vote against a team on conditionality but usually theory is rejection of the argument.

Kritiks - Probably not the best idea. But if that's your thing, you must win your framework arguments. Also clearly explain your arguments and how they relate with the affirmative case (Ie you need to have specific links and explain them)

Don't hesitate to ask me any questions and Good Luck!
