  I am a parent judge. I have been judging LD debate for four years.

Don't focus so much on framework that you neglect the contention-level debate, and don''t try to use framework arguments to get out of debating the actual resolution. Do a lot of weighing; help me understand why your arguments and impacts are more important than your opponent's.

Please do not spread or run kritiks, plans, disads, theory etc.
Speak clearly and confidently, and have fun debating!
