  I debated for four years on the Dallas circuit and debated 1 year of college at UNT. Although I am willing to listen to any argument I would prefer to hear policy arguments, I love a DA and CP debate. K's are fine but you may have to give me a bit more explanation because of my lack of background knowledge. Despite most of the communities loathing of this kind of debate I enjoy a good T or theory debate. Speed is fine as long as you are clear and loud enough for me to hear. I do not like to do a lot of works for teams so don't expect me to cross apply or extend your arguments that you make a 3 second blip about, if you want to win an argument make sure you give good WARRANTED analysis.
