  Affiliation: Damien High School I debated four years at Damien High School (2002-2006). I am currently a senior at Northwestern University. This will be the first time I will be judging on this years topic. I have judged periodically throughout the last four years.  Debate in whatever way is most comfortable for you. I wouldn't say that I have any strong preferences. I am open to most arguments. Speed is fine, but clarity is essential. I have no problem voting on T assuming there is a solid T debate. Theory is something that needs to be developed really well for me to vote on. Counter Plans and Disads are sweet. Impact calculus is a must. I definitely know more about policy arguments than kritiks. However, a K debate is fine with me, the more specific the kritik the better. 
If you have any questions, please just ask.
