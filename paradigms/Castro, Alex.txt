  I debated for Arthur L. Johnson (NJ) for 4 years qualifying to the TOC as a senior.

I currently coach Shawn Tuteja from The Altamont School.

I'll vote on any well warranted argument (I ran a position saying we should kill people) as long as it is clear. Therefore it is your job as a debater to be clear and explain yourself so I understand what is going on.

I'm fine with speed because chances are I can flow it, but slower rounds are always easier to judge.

In terms of theory I will only pull the trigger on it if I think there is legitimate abuse. In other words only run theory if the abuse is really clear in your mind. I do NOT vote on potential abuse.

Speaks- I'll probably range from 26-30
