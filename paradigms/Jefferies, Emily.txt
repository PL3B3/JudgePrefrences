I debated policy for four years at Tonganoxie High School in Kansas, but I don’t debate at the college level. I judge in the Baltimore area when I can fit it in. I vote mainly as a policymaker judge; make sure that by the end of the debate you have explained to me why I should vote on your arguments. And please don’t forget to weigh the round. I won’t vote on arguments that are underdeveloped and haven’t been weighed. 
 
Topicality: I’m not a huge fan of topicality arguments unless the violation is blatant. If you are going to run T, go for it. Don’t waste our time by running it as a time suck. Also, if you are going for it, make sure the standards are clear and logical. 
 
Disads: Make sure your uniqueness is current, your links are specific and your impacts are clear. I will definitely vote on a DA if it is run correctly and clearly outweighs the Aff case.  
 
Counter-plans: While I didn’t debate counter-plans during my debate career, I welcome them in rounds. I think they are super fun. However, since I never debated them I’m not used to seeing them or weighing them in rounds. I will still vote on them though. So again, make sure that you fully explain the argument and why it’s the best policy in the round. 
 
Kritiks: I also never debated Ks in high school. I don’t discourage you from running them, but don’t assume that I will understand the K, especially if you are speeding. Slow down and over simplify what the K is and why the K matters in the round.  
 
Speed: If you can speed while also enunciating your words so I can semi-understand you, that’s fine. I didn’t speed or debate people who sped in high school so I am not used to flowing it. So if you want to speed, slow down and give me a summary at the end of your speech. Or just slow down.  
 
Mainly, run what you want. Just don’t forget to make your arguments CLEAR and don’t neglect to weigh them.
