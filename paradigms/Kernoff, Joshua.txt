PHILOSOPHY
I debated four years in high school and four years in college at Dartmouth.

Debate whatever you want in front of me... Although I ran mostly policy arguments I'm open to anything... Certain arguments that I am less familiar with (eg more obscure K's) might require a bit more explanation for me.

Theory: I think most args are reasons to reject the arg, not the team... It'll probably be hard to get me to vote on PICS, conditionality, K's bad.... although I am more than willing to vote that some particular CPs are bad (consult, delay, multi actor I Fiat, etc).

Topicality: I'm probably more susceptible than most judges to privilege args like reasonability and aff predictability, but that doesnt mean I won't vote on T...

Be Nice, have fun.
