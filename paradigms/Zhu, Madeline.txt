  I debated for three years for Claremont High School, two of which were at circuit level. I'll vote off the flow exclusively; these are just my personal preferences:
-Speed--I was a fast debater; that being said, I think it's easier to be fast than to flow speed. Go as fast as you think is strategic and I'll clear you once or twice if necessary; it usually isn't that much of an issue. That being said, the faster you are the less clear you generally are, and I think a slightly slower round that is more comprehensible is a better one--if I'm clearing you because of enunciation, you will loose speaker points, and you need to clear up. 
-Theory--I don't vote off of potential abuse. I also have a high threshold for abuse and a very low threshold for throwaway theory that's just run as a strategy. If it's completely dropped, or you're very clearly winning it, I'll vote for it, but it will cost you speaker points and I'll probably hold you to a higher standard in other parts of the round to make up for it. Almost every debate can be resolved without theory if you are thinking about it, and cases should be written strategically. If stupid theory penalizes debaters for making smart choices or unique arguments, then it doesn't contribute to the activity. 
-Critical/unusual arguments--They're really interesting, but tend to have dubious link chains/impact scenarios. As long as your position is well crafted and explained, you're fine--but you should be very clear about the warrants and your advocacy. I haven't personally read a lot of the standard critical authors, so don't assume that simply saying 'this is biopolotical' will mean much. Make sure you understand your position!
-Signposting and internal structure is absolutely necessary. Not signposting or having a disorganized case that hinders the progress of the round will cost you speaker points. 
-Be polite, and have fun! Don't take debate too seriously--after all, it is only a game. Remember that you and your opponent are not deadly enemies after the round, and make it an enjoyable experience!
