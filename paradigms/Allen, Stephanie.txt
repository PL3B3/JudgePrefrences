I was a policy debater in high school and college and have been a debate coach of policy and LD off and since then.

I don't think a judge should come into the round with preconceived notions about what the debaters should or should not do. I am thus opposed to these judging philosophies that make a debater feel he or she must cow-tow to the judge. Debate is about debaters choosing and presenting persuasive arguments. I have no strong feelings for or against any types of arguments and will vote for the team that proves their points the best- by persuasion, by evidence, by any means they see fit.
