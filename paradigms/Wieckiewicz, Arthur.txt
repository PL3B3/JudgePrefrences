  I debated for 4 years in high school, I have been judging LD/PF for 7 years and been coaching LD/PF at Fenwick High School for 4 years. In general I am open to nearly every argument; with a few exceptions/variations.

1.Theory. I am fine with it. Actually, I find some theory debates to be quite interesting. In
some cases I will vote off of frivolous theory, however as theoretical
arguments get increasingly ridiculous, I will have an increasingly low
threshold for accepting refutations. Also; I default to theory as drop the arg
and no RVI. However I am open to having my mind changed in round. Also; I
will not vote on disclosure theory.

2. Kritiks. In general I think they are very educational arguments. However; I
am not a big fan of performance arguments. I just do not enjoy them. Plain and simple.

3. Plans/CPs/Disads: Despite the fact that I believe these often stunt an
otherwise incredibly intellectual atmosphere, there are exceptions to this
rule. If you are able to run a good plan, I can definitely see myself voting on it.
As for counterplans—no PICs. Please. I do not find that these make for a
decent debate round.

If it helps anyone I default to truth-testing on debate over the resolution. Speed
is okay but I will say “clear” if I cannot understand you or if you are speaking too
fast. Be very clear when listing authors and when/if you move to a new part in your speech. Be intelligible and make sure to signpost; because if I can’t hear it, I can’t flow it.

Misc:
I do not disclose or give oral critiques after a round unless I absolutely have to, even then I will just read what I wrote on the ballot without going into details.
