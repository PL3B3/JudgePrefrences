Please strike me if you spread. I will not be able to understand you. I am most familiar with the value/value criterion mode If you are going to do anything policy-ish, pref me low because I am not familiar with policy. DO NOT RUN THEORY. Also I see theory as a call for judge intervention, so if you run it, you probably won't be happy with the decision. I value politeness and professionalism in a round. I vote almost exclusively on persuasion and presentation.
