  I have been working as a debate judge for high school and college for the past three years. Initially, I started out as a lay judge, as my own schools never offered debate, but in the intervening seasons have worked many tournaments judging Lincoln-Douglas, Policy, Parliamentary, and Public Forum.

I believe that as debate is an educational competitive event, students should debate using whatever strategy they believe is their strongest. As such, I don't have strong preferences in terms of spreading, theory, or other factors. Instead, I want to see each side do the best job that they can, using whichever strategy the debaters feel is their best or strongest.

I judge primarily on the flow, and if one side drops a key argument, that will decide the round. If neither side drops an argument, or if both drops an argument, my secondary criteria is evaluating the arguments based on the framework set up by the debaters. Should this, as well, come out evenly, my final criteria is on who made the more compelling and convincing argument.
