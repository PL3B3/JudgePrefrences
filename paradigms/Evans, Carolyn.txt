General Philosophy: I'll try and let the debaters guide me, but if you make the round a mess and aren't really telling me where to vote, I will drop your speaker points and it will be difficult for me to figure out where I am going to vote. I believe debate is a safe space so I will not evaluate arguments like "racism good" or "suicide good". Don't make those in front of me.

Speed: I prefer you go a little slower (you can still speed and spread). I'm not at the speed of policy debate, but I can do a medium speed LD round no problem. I'll say "CLEAR" if I can't understand.

Theory: I prefer proven abuse to potential abuse, but if your opponent mishandles theory, I might still vote on it.

Kritiks: Make sure there's a strong link. Please understand your alt or demonstrate some alt solvency! 

Key Voting Issues/Overviews: You have to tell me where to vote. I really prefer to vote on the contentions, not just on framework alone. I'm always going to understand policy better so your best bet with me is to win more traditional positions. But other than that, tell me what to vote on. I won't vote on an argument you don't go for, so you have to go for it, and you have to tell me why you're winning it. But having said that, I also like to see you collapse to the issues you're winning so don't try and win everything.
