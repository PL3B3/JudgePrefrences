  Background
I've been judging debate for approximately 3 years.

Generic
1. Please be respectful.There is a difference between being assertive and being disrespectful. I love it when people are assertive and I encourage everyone to do so.
2. Please do not spread. 
3. Clarity is extremely important. I prefer persuasion over speed - slowing down on important points, making eye contact with me -- those are good ways to signify that an argument is important.
4. I keep a running clock: Speech ends, CX starts, CX ends, prep starts unless you indicate otherwise.
5. Please be to sure to weight your claims, and analyze your evidence (tell me what your evidence means in YOUR words).



Specifics

Kritik - If you read a kritik, you'll have to clearly explain each facet in deep detail (not a huge fan).
Topicality - I am absolutely fine with topicality debates, and enjoy them to a certain extent :D.
CP - Love to hear a quality, in-depth CP.
