  Gittens, DivaTopicality:I enjoy hearing creative T arguments and will definately vote on them if well supported. But this is not to say that I enjoy hearing definitions that the AFF could never meet. If such abuse occurs, I would be willing to listen to reverse voter.Speed:If I didn't hear it, it didn't happen. Plain, simple, expected. If you are gasping or slurring, you are going too fast. Eloquence is very important to me. New in 2NC:No.Theory:I don't like seeing rounds dominated by theory. A little bit is acceptable, but please don't ruin the debate by only running theory arguements.K:Must have an alternative. Also, must go beyond rejecting the AFF. Some sort of action should be taken. (What should "we" be taking instead)CP:Must be non-topical. I tend to think that 'pics' can get abusive quick.CX:I don't like open CX. The more you do it, the more your speaker points will suffer.Behavior:Be polite and keep a sense of humor. In other words, enjoy the seriousness of this fake situation.I think it is disrespectful to read over a speaker's shoulders. Please wait until the speaker is finished with the cards before you take them.
