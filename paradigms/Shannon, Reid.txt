I'm down for whatever. I will try to evaluate the debate based on what you tell me, and the team that controls this should win. 

Topicality: I understand the importance of making these debates about "competing interpretations," but leave some attention to why the specific aff is bad for debate. 

Kritiks: Recognize that I probably have not read literature you are drawing from, and take time to explain the jump from link to terminal impact. I generally believe the affirmative gets to weigh the plan against the kritik, but could be convinced that the advantages are not competitive. 

Counterplan Theory: I lean negative on most of these questions, and the affirmative has to win offense which supersedes simply rejecting the argument.
