  I am a parent judge. DO NOT SPREAD. This is my first year judging LD debate. I appreciate arguments on philosophical grounds that make logical sense. Explain each argument as though it is a new argument I have never heard before. Make sure to weigh arguments, and I will vote for the more convincing side.

Do not run kâ€™s, plans, disads, theory,etc.
