  Experience - 2 1/2 years Parli, 2 years policy

General - Anything goes, debate is a game.

Theory - I enjoy theory, but only if it's run well. Slow down on the interpretation. I only need articulated abuse on theory that is not a rules violations, so T doesn't need articulated abuse. I'll vote for an RVI if there are multiple procedurals and they seem ridiculous, but you need better reasons to prefer other than reciprocity.

Kritiks - I understand basic kritik literature, but if you want to run something that is completely unique make sure your thesis is clear, so that I have a general idea of how it functions. Give me an interpretation of how to weigh the kritik.

CP's - I'm cool with any counterplan strategy, but make sure that your competition sheet is clear and how exactly it solves for case adv's. Speed - I'm good with speed, but just make sure you are clear. Slow down or switch your tone if you want me to highlight an argument mentally. I will say clear if I can't follow you. 

Rebuttals - Weigh arguments against each other, compare and contrast the world of the neg vs the aff, and collapse. 

Speaks - I average 27 for speaks, 28 if you're good, 29 for people who make only smart arguments, and 30 for those who are so good that they blow my mind.
