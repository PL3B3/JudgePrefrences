  Debate history:
In high school, I was a member of Mountain View's speech and debate team. I mostly did LD but also took 5A State in PFD my Junior year.
In college I briefly debated on Harvard's parliamentary debate team. I graduated college in 2013.

Preferences:
I will find it hard to accept some negative kritiks unless the debater provides me with a clear route to victory for their side. Speed, etc, are all fine.
