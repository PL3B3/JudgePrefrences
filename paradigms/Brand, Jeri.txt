  I am currently a senior at Pace and have been debating for four years. I've been a 2N for the last two years.
I went to UMich 7wk this summer and I travel frequently so I know topic norms etc. I read a policy aff. My 2NRs during first semester were basically all politics/CPs, and my second semester 2NRs have all been a gender identity K. 

Short version:
Run what you are good at. I would rather listen to an argument I hate that is done well than listening to an argument I enjoy done poorly. I vote on who wins on my flows, and am unlikely to call for cards unless you tell me to.

Affs:
Read anything. I don't care. I'm equally likely to go aff or neg on framework.

Kritiks:
I love listening to K debates but asinine pomo buzzwords make me want to die. I can hack out either way for in-depth aff explanation or sweeping 2nr overviews.

Other things: There is such a thing as 0% risk of CP solvency or risk of a DA. In-depth DA debates (especially politics) are my favorite part of this activity. Theory is not an auto-win for the aff, even if they drop it - you have to be able to extend it competently. Bonus points if you make fun of Pace LS.
