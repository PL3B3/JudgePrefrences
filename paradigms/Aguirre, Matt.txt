Run your arguments, explain and warrant them well. K/Performance/etc is fine but these (like all) arguments are much more persuasive if you actually know what you're talking about. In the end it's your debate, not mine. I'd much rather watch a good debate than one that contains stuff I happen to like/agree with. Whatever it is, make it interesting, educational, and fun.
I read the K a lot in high school. However this does not mean that I'll automatically understand your jargon and do work for you. I highly value clarity and smart arguments. I feel that in many cases one well developed argument is more valuable than several blippy ones. Debate is a communicative activity; treat it as such. Analysis and in-depth explanations of your arguments and why they warrant my ballot are very important (especially in final rebuttals). Also, please slow down on your tags - I keep a good flow but if it's a royal pain for me to merely understand what you're saying, I won't be too happy about it.
The going standard on paperless debate seems to be that prep ends when you eject the jump drive so that's what I'll enforce. I'm sympathetic with tech issues (it happens) but that's not an excuse for you to be technologically incompetent.
Have fun, play nice.
If you have any questions please feel free to ask.
