  I coach debate at Randolph High School in New Jersey. 

If we're just talking about preferences, I enjoy judging rounds that stay on the resolution as opposed to those that go off. However, I'm willing to vote based on other off cases, and I won't hold it against you if you go there. I don't vote based on what I like or dislike; I look at how convincing your arguments are.

If you must run theory, make sure the abuse is obvious and well-explained.

Make sure you learn something and have fun!
