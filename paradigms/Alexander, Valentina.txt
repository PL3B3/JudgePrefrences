Theory Assumptions
Theory precedes substance
Default competing interpretations
Real abuse matters
Topicality precedes AC offense

Role of the Ballot
The role of the ballot is generally up to the debaters in the round. You tell me what matters and how it implicates the ballot.

Round Logistics
Flash time is not prep time and I expect debaters to keep track of their own time.
If there is a speech doc, please send to my email.
Evidence matters and should be cut ethically. Do NOT ever clip cards.
I evaluate un-underlined parts of evidence, but only in circumstances where a debate cuts a card unethically.

Non-traditional Arguments
Familiar with practically anything you throw at me.
Don't assume you can be lazy, just because you think I know.
Include a role of the ballot and/or judge.
Ask before round, if unsure.

Speaker Points
Based on both articulation and strategic execution.
I normally don't yell clear, but you will see it in my face.
Speed is not an issue, just be clear.

30: Perfect.29: Impressive.28: Meh.27: Practice.
