LD Philosophy: I am open to all styles of argumentation, and have very few specific preferences. However, I will touch on a few of the things I prefer to see in a debate.

Value/Criterion: Although emphasis on Value conflicts have been dwindling, at least in my experience, I enjoy good value argumentation if the conflict is there, if not, make sure the value isn’t abandoned and focus more energy on the criterion clashes. More than anything as a judge, I want you to solidly establish how I am to weigh the round.

Evidence: Good evidence can go a long way, but very few things can overshadow solid analytic interpretation and analysis. I believe an effective LD debate has more or less equal parts of both. Evidence should impact, and that impact should be carried through any extensions. I have also never been a fan of the use of evidence in the 2AR, and in all my experience have never heard a reasonable justification for doing so.

Speed: On a 1-10 scale, I prefer a 5, but I can work up to a 7 or 8. Usually if things get moving a little fast I end up with a sparse flow, and at a certain point have been know to stop flowing in the interest of simply being able to catch what you are saying. If I do this it’s a good idea to slow down. I believe LD rounds should move at a comfortable pace so as to convey the larger ideas rather than hammer out 12 minutes of small stuff in 6 or 7. 

If you do your job, there should be very little question in my mind who gets the W, but if you have any questions, always feel free to ask.
