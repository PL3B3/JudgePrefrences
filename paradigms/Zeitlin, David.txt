School Strikes: University School of Nashville
Rounds judged on the topic: 0

Background:
I debated for four years at the University School of Nashville. Most of my background is in the Michigan State style of debate, so take that for what you will.

Topic Familiarity:
I’m somewhat familiar with the topic because I did some coaching earlier in the year, but don’t assume I know what you’re talking about when you’re making an argument (don’t introduce concepts the first time as acronyms, etc).

Speed:
Speed is fine just be clear

Argument Preferences:
Anything is fair game, but I am less familiar/comfortable with Ks than I am with DA/Case/CP/T/Theory.
Ideal 2NRs:
Politics Case
Politics CP
Topic specific T
PIC w/ internal net benefit
Impact Turns
Topic K generic (must be made germane to the plan)
*Consult/Condition/Threaten CP
*Very generic K
*Probably should avoid even reading

The team that almost always wins my ballot is whoever is controlling the big picture framing issues.

Theory cliff notes:
-cheap shots are only voters if never answered
-framework usually can’t change the decision from a yes/no policy question
-You usually have to prove that theory damages competitive equity to win a violation, I am more sympathetic to setting a precedent on topicality than theory.

DA cliff notes:
-Link controls the direction of uniqueness
-Dropped turns case is devastating
-Controlling impact comparison coming out of the block is crucial

Paperless rules:
-I stop time when the flash drive comes out unless there is a serious computer malfunction
-If total flashing time takes over 10 minutes per team I will start running time while flashing

Speaker points:
Ways to get high points:
-Be nice to me, your partner, and your opponents (that does not mean avoiding being competitive or being a kiss ass)
-Be funny
-Make good arguments

Ways to get lower points
-trying to be funny and not
-being a dick
-stealing prep time
-making shallow framing arguments
-tagline extensions of important arguments
-reading complete shit in the 1NC
-RVIs

Have fun, remember debate is a game, do what you do well and you will be in good shape.
