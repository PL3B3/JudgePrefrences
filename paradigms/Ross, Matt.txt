  Background: I debated for Bronx Science on the national circuit for four years, graduating in 2011, and attending the TOC my Junior and Senior Years. I rarely judge, however I have taught at summer debate institutes during the past two summers.

Speed: I don't mind speed as long as you are clear (I'll let you know if you aren't). If you ignore me and continue to be unclear I will stop flowing.
Theory: Theory is fine, so long as it has some sort of internal structure. I am receptive to RVIs but will be less so if they are a result of theory baiting.
Kritiks: I am not that familiar with critical literature, so just make sure to explain critical arguments thoroughly. I will not assume that what you are saying makes sense just because I don't understand it.
Speaker points: I start from a 27 (average) and go up or down from there.
Framework: I expect framework arguments to have the same level of development as contention-level arguments, meaning that basic argumentative standards such as well-articulated and logical warrants apply. If your go-to strategy is a case loaded down with one or two sentence spikes and tricks, rather than arguments, your speaks will suffer. Other than that, the only framework I have a strong preference against is skepticism. If you are going to debate about norms, advocate one.

If you have any other questions about how I judge, don't hesitate to ask before the round.
