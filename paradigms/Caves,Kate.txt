  I'm pretty much “game” for all arguments. Successful debaters resolve competing arguments in their favor. My role is to decide if you did that more successfully than your opponent did. I can only do that if I can understand your argument. To be successful at this, you MUST warrant your arguments and extend your warrants.(“Extend Khalizad moving on” is not sufficient.) 

A few notes:

1.When it comes to T- If you’re neg, tell me why the aff’s interpretation prevents you from having a fair shot at winning . It's not enough to tell me that the world for the neg would be slightly better if every aff team adopted your interpretation.
2.When it comes to the K- If there’s an alt, aff needs to answer it, or aff will lose because utopia is always better than the plan.
3.I flow as much as I can, thus I do my best not to read cards at the end of a round.
4. Cross-X is a very valuable tool. Use it in a valuable manner and I'll give you more speaker points. 
5. Theory is not my strong suite so if your going to go for it, do a good job. 


I know most of you work extremely hard at this sport. I respect that. Try to have fun!
