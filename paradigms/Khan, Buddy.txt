I debated for 4 years on the national circuit in high school and another 4 in college, qualifying to 4 NDTs.
I don't have a whole lot to say about how I want you to debate except to say that you should do what you are most comfortable with, I've been in most types of debates and feel confident navigating them as a judge. Other than that, be respectful of your opponents and I'm sure we'll get along fine.
