  I was a very active Parli debater throughout college and have judged a fair number of LD rounds. The breakdown of how I value arguments versus presentation is 100% / 0% for deciding who wins, and somewhere around 67% / 33% for determining speaks. I am open to any type of argument but I prefer speeches that flow logically rather than those that rely on appeals to authority or the expertise of a source.

I flow pretty quickly, so as long as you are speaking clearly and aren't going absurdly fast speed shouldn't be a problem.

Happy to answer any other questions you might have before the round.
