  Milton Academy '16, Wellesley College '20


Conflicts: Milton Academy 


I debated policy for Milton Academy (MA) for three years, and currently debate American Parliamentary for Wellesley College. 


PLEASE DON’T: 
-Give up clarity for speed: Essentially, if I can’t understand what you are saying, you will not be convincing. 


-Say the same point multiple times in different (or the same) words: I find that this is only a problem when nerves become overpowering. However, when this happens, I would much rather you pause and take a moment to reorder your thoughts; please don’t speak just for the sake of speaking. 


-Be excessively aggressive towards your opponents. There’s a difference between being firm and being rude. You are there to criticize opponents’ points; I will penalize you if you criticize anything else.


-Say your opponent dropped your points when your opponent didn’t: If I find a discrepancy between my flow and your claim, I will penalize you. 


-Bring up new points in rebuttals: A new point is not an example, no matter how hard you try and frame it to be. Please--just don’t :) 


PLEASE DO: 
-Claim, Warrant, Impact: In other words, what are you arguing? Why does your argument make sense? Why should I care? 

-Signpost: If possible, please signpost as explicitly as possible (ex. My first argument is, My second argument is, In conclusion, etc)
