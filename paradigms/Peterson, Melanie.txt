  I would say that I fall somewhere between stock issues and tabula rasa; I am fairly open to any arguments you make convincingly. I am fine with counterplans, kritiks, and theory. Although I help out with debate as the assistant coach where I teach, my experience with debate was limited in high school, so I will probably struggle to flow breakneck speeds. I appreciate signposting and polite civility, especially during CX.
