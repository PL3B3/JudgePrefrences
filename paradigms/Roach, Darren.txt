   I am a parent judge who enjoys judging. I consider it a privilege to judge the future leaders of our country. My paradigm is very simple I enjoy a good debate with a lot of clash,while staying polite and being courteous to your opponents. I also enjoy clear and logical arguments that are easy to follow at all time. I do not like spreading at all, you should speak at a steady pace. I do not take any personal bias into account when judging and am looking forward to an exciting round.
