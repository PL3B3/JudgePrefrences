  I am a parent and attorney with a student who does LD for Walt Whitman High School. I have judged for two years, mainly at the Virginia and Maryland tournaments. When judging, I listen carefully to the arguments and flow cases. I am most familiar with a value-criterion structure, with students debating the merits of each othersâ€™ standards. I look for crystallization of the most important issues in the round. Flagging voting issues in the 2NR and 2AR is recommended as it will help me decide who wins.
