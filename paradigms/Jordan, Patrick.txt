  Background: I have debated in high school for four years. I have debated both varsity Public Forum and varsity Lincoln Douglas. I have been a NYC champion in team Lincoln Douglas Debate. I have competed at state competition and nationals. I am currently a college debater and have debated both Policy and Parliament. I have judged many circuit and local competitions from Columbia to nationals.

Quick Points (For those who are lazy)
LD: theory good, speed good, kritiks good, off cases good, no flex prep
PF: no theory, no speed, no kritiks, no off cases, no flex prep

LD:
Round: If you are speaking you must be standing. Do not be rude during the round, this will cost you speaker points. 

Speed: Clarity over speed. I prefer more thought out arguments. 

Kritiks/ off cases/ theory: I prefer theory debate to be done correctly. If your opponent is debating improperly (defined rules of LD) then theory is warranted. If you believe that the way LD is debated is improper then do not use theory. DEBATE THE TOPIC!

Judging the round: I will judge the round based on the most rational argument put forth. If you can prove to me you have the most rational argument you win the round. I will call your card if you or your opponent brings it up as a questionable piece of evidence in a round or if I question the validity of your card. In my experience a card that is too good to be true often is. Good philosophical arguments are stronger than evidence. 

Scale: 20-30
20-22: You are rude and did not properly debate
23-25: Followed rules of debate, but did not perform well
26-27: Debated adequately
28-29: Debated well
30: Perfect debate, did not drop points and defended all of your points. Clear, thorough, debated subject well
