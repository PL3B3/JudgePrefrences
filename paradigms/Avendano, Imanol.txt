My Bio: I was predominately a K-debater in high school. Lots of Psychoanalysis and Bataille. Little bit of performance debate too. Mike Baxter-Kauf coached me, take that for what you will.

Specifics:
K - This is my bread and butter. When going for the K, try to make use of analogies and historical examples. It makes it easier for me to grasp the complexity of your argument. It'll also boost your speaker points.

T - If you plan on going for or answering this argument effectively, give me a clear vision of what your topic would look like. I generally lean towards competing interpretations.

CP - The more specific, the better. International and other shady CPs are vulnerable to theory.

DA - Make sure to tell me the story of your disad. I want to know what I'm voting for at the end of the round.

Theory - Please speak slower. Chances are I'm flowing on paper and won't be able to get everything down if you are going too fast.

Non-traditional arguments -
Aff: Perfectly fine with me. I enjoy judging these debates. Don't forget about the arguments made in your music, poetry, ect...
Neg: Make sure that you deal with the specificity of the aff if you plan on reading FW.
Other things: If you have a Role of the Ballot claim and the other team has a ROB claim, please give me a reason to prefer your ROB. I've judged too many debates where there are two ROB at the end of the round and not a reason to prefer one over the other.

Tips:
- Don't be afraid to make jokes, even if they're terrible.
- I prefer slower debating. If you are a fast debater, try to slow down for those especially key points of your speech. I find these sorts of moments to be very persuasive. 
- I like to see compartmentalization in the later speeches (i.e. link debate, impact debate, uniqueness, ect...). It makes it easier for me to resolve debates.
