  I am a parent judge associated with Evergreen Valley High School.

I have been judging LD for 2 years. I will buy arguments that seem logical to me. Please speak clearly around conversational speed (no spreading)
During the debate I closely watch for rebuttals and cross examinations. 

Time yourself and be respectful of the opponent's requests.
