  well, i am a tab judge.
i don't necessarily value one type of argument over another.
unless it's well justified, please don't waste my time with topicality.
if you don't give me a framework, i default to policymaker.
explain your arguments. impact calculus is good.
all that said . . . bring the crazy.
i absolutely love it when you debate outside the box. by this i mean unconventional.
K's, CP's, Theory . . . i can handle just about anything you can throw at me.
BUT don't use these arguments to try and win my favor.
like i said, i don't value one TYPE of argument over another.
So if you just toss some lame K at a well structured argument, the latter will always win.
if you aren't polite, i will destroy your speaks. remember that this is a game.
open CX gives me the impression that you are inept. please don't do it.
evidence is not always needed to make a good argument.
be clear rather than fast. style and presentation are very important, but less so than actual argumentation.
if you have any questions before the round starts, feel free to ask.
be interesting. have fun.
