  I debated for Bronx Science for three years in LD. Since graduating in June 2012, I have had very little experience judging debate tournaments. Therefore, treat me as someone who’s just a few tiers above a parent judge.

As for specifics: don’t spread as fast as you can. Speed and clarity are two different things, and I highly value the latter. I was never a big debater of kritiks, theory, and all that other fun stuff, so try not to use them. But if you do, make sure to explain them well, and I’ll do my best to accommodate.

Framework is important. So is weighing.

These are pretty standard; if you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask me before the round.
