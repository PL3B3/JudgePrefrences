-Do not run a K unless you know it inside and out. I will drop you on poorly run off-case arguments combined with a lack of on-case coverage.
-I like stock issues, particularly solvency and harms.
-No stock DAs with a barely-there link. If an Aff team can prove the link is faulty I probably won't vote for the Neg.

-I expect the debaters to shape and weight the round. Tell me what is important and what to vote on.
-Be civil to each other.
