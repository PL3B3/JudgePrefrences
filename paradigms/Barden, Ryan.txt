  I have been out of debate for a long time. I debated for four years in high school and one in college, all in Kansas. UT will be my first tournament since the mid '90s, so I won't know the shorthand for this topic. 

I am aware of how debate has evolved since my time, but I admit that I am not smart on it. I never ran the Kritik, but I am open to it as long as you are able to articulate its structure and how it relates to my ballot. I loved debate on actual policies, but I will vote on any theory argument if you can convince me that I should. 

My ideal round will involve direct clash on as many points as possible. I believe that good debaters can pick up nonverbal cues from their judges, so that should help you determine if your speed is working and if I'm buying your arguments. If I stop writing, you should probably move on. Also, please make sure to tell me where you're going.
