  I graduate from Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York, and am currently a student at Harvard University. My high school debate career was spent in Lincoln-Douglas, Public Forum, Congress, and Extemp. Currently, I do parliamentary debate in college.

Please, please just justify your arguments, extend properly, and weigh properly. Write my ballot for me; I want you to spell out how you won the round over your opponent. Ensure that real clash exists. I judge based on what’s on my flow.

As for speed, I did LD, so I can handle it if need be, but make sure you are clear. If I can’t understand it, it doesn’t count. Also, don’t just rattle off your cards; actually read them. I won’t call for cards, so if I can’t understand you as out loud, it won’t be on my flow. I guess I’ll listen to theory, but make sure you don’t use it as a crutch and only use it to take down something truly abusive. If you run theory that is unnecessary or absolutely ridiculous and your opponent at least briefly attacks it, it will fall.

I’m not all that well-versed in the use of K’s, Disads, Counterplans, etc, and I would prefer that such tactics stay in policy debate, but if you feel it could enhance the debate, by all means, go for it. Just make sure you make it clear as to what you’re saying.

And this goes without saying, but there’s no need to be overtly rude to your opponents. Be funny if you want, but don’t be offensive. Additionally, I disclose and give oral critiques.

Any other questions, please feel free to ask; most likely, I’ll repeat the key parts of this prior to the round. Thanks, and I look forward to judging your round!
