  I assign wins based on which team has more compelling offense still standing by the end of the round. Weighing arguments against each other to give me a way to prefer one team's offense over the other's will make a win much easier to adjudicate for me. If no weighing is done, I will be forced to just pick whichever argument I find more compelling.

All offense from case and turns must be extended through both the summary and the final focus in order for me to evaluate it. I don't need the first speaking team to address defense on their opponents' case in summary, and I don't need for the second speaking team to frontline their case in rebuttal in order for me to evaluate it. 

I prefer for debaters to stand during all speeches and crossfires except for GCX. I can handle speed, but I won't flow spreading. I don't believe the timer on prep time should be running when a debater is pulling up a contested card. The caveat is that no one should be prepping during this time.

Speaker Point Breakdown:
30 - Phenomenal 
>= 29 - Good; doing everything you should be doing
>= 28 - Solid; some improvements need to be made
< 27 - I don't give below a 27 unless debaters are rude or offensive. 

Experience: I competed in PF all four years of high school. I have experience on both the national and local Dallas circuits. Now I coach PF.

If you have any more questions feel free to ask me before round.
