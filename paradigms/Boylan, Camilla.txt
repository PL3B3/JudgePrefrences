I have been the coach at Mountain View HS in Idaho for eight years. Idaho is a very traditional state when it comes to debate, so that is what I am an expert on, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to new ideas. I really try to judge only on what is presented in the round and do a pretty good job of keeping my biases out of the conversation. This can be a challenge when misinformation is presented but if the other side doesn’t point it out, I won’t judge on it. I will, however, correct you on the ballot.

Framework: I work best with the more traditional arguments and I love V/C clash and like it when you explain to me why yours is the best and can back it up with your contentions. I really like it when you can not only destroy your opponents VC, but can also meet it better than them, if it is warranted. 

Plan text: if the resolution seems to call for a plan text, I'm ok if you have one or a counter advocacy, but I don't prefer them.

Theory and Kritiks: Again, as I said, I’m from a traditional state but this doesn’t mean I am opposed to these types of arguments. What is does mean is that I might be hearing it for the first time from you, so explain it well for me. If I stop flowing or look at you with a puzzled expression, take a moment to spell it out for me in simple terms. If I don’t understand what you are discussing, I can’t judge on it.

Speed can be OK, as long as I understand the argument. But if you are bringing up a K or odd theory, talk slower so I can process the info.
