  Debate philosophy:
Enjoy the experience! There is no downside to what you’re doing. It’s brave and inspiring.No spreading. Speak at a rate and volume that you might use if presenting in a normal classroom setting (i.e., not particularly a LD debate). If I cannot understand your arguments, then I certainly cannot be convinced by them.Use your speaking time and structure well, e.g., to allow for strong closing statements which stress your most salient points.Be professional at all times (especially while in the room)! You should be able to engage assertively without being rude or condescending to your opponent.Integrity is paramount. This applies to use of resources and citing of references. Although you may not be called out for infractions in every case, YOU will know if you were using legitimate references. It’s not worth compromising one’s character. Nothing is.While you are not required to cite (factual) evidence for every argument, it tends to lend more credibility to your argument, especially where evidence should exist in support of your contention.Don’t ask your opponent ANY questions in my presence (e.g., before or after the debate itself) that would tend to let me know (even indirectly) that the other debater is less experienced, has previously lost on this resolution, etc.
