POLICY
I'm a policy-maker that believes that my ballot should go to the team with the best policy option, including the status quo. I'm not afraid to vote on presumption if you haven't done your job. 

Speed: Stick to a 60-70% of your max and you'll be fine. I'm not a flow-bot and I don't want to have to wait for CX to find out what your advocacy is. 

I like case debate. D/As are great. See specifics below. 

Topicality: I like nearly all forms of T. If you're going to go for it in the 2NR, that's all that should be there. There should be a clear violation and extended standards. "It's a stock issue," is not a standard. 

CPs: One at max. Two worlds at max, including the Status Quo. Must be competitive. Theory is prime for the Aff. 

Theory: I like a good theory debate, but it should go beyond the pre-written blocks that you have and try to re-read in the rebuttal.

Ks: Try if you must. I don't like to vote on them, because I view the round and ballot through the lens of a policy-maker. I dislike generic Alts that are just to reject the plan. That does nothing for me. I've voted on them before, but it doesn't mean I'm going to vote for it this time. Also, if your tags are multiple sentences of academic jargon, don't expect much ink on the flow.
