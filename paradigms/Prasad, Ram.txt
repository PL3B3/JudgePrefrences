  I debated for two and half years for La Jolla High School, in CA. I cleared twice at TOC, was top seed, top speaker, and got to quarters as a senior. I now attend Yale. I no longer hold strong views on debate, so read what you like, be it the utils, morals, theory, or the project. As long as you execute the strat well, I'm happy to listen to it. My knowledge of dense phil and K lit is weak, so it'd behoove you to slow down and over explain. Plus speaker points for sass, tech, good evidence, an entertaining CX, and tasteful references to classic cars.

TOC Update: I haven't judged any debates on this topic so build up to your top speed and over explain on T. I will evaluate positions that indict a debater's out of round conduct or highlight an out of round incident, but I'd advise against running them in front of me because I'm not up to date with debate gossip. Good luck, and have fun!
