  I have four years of high school policy and four years of college parli experience. I have also coached high school policy for two years.

I generally vote on theory first, although I can be persuaded to do otherwise. I view theory like I view a disad - win an unique impact that links and outweighs, and I'll vote for it.

As for critiques (aff or neg), disads, and counterplans, I vote on the flow.

I also prefer theory, topicality, and plan/cp/alt text to be clear, so that might mean slower.
