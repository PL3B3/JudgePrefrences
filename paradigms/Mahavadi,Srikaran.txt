  I have a very simple judging mentality for PF. I debated PF for 3 years in high school and have judged 10-12 tournaments in PF in the past few years so please take the following advice to heart and I will almost always vote for you.

Evidence is what matters. I expect for you to have blocks/arguments prepared on either side of the issue backed up with reliable sources. Without any evidence, an analytical argument is very weak and will have to be laid out for me to vote in your favor.

Tell me how I should vote. Your last speech should focus on me and providing a concise yet clear summary of the round to me and specific reasons as to why I should vote for you. Do not keep arguing in your last speech for any arguments created in prior speeches. That is a waste of your time.

Do not create blank extensions that have no clear warrants/impacts. They prove nothing and are a waste of time. If your opponent drops an argument, explain why that argument is important for your side of the case and reiterate the warrants/impacts with evidence.

Speed is fine with me...to an extent. Do not mix your words together to where I cannot understand your argument or the point you are trying to make.I would much prefer a slower speaker that hits home with two points than a fast speaker who briefly argues 4-5 points.

Professionalism/speaker skills are also half of the reason in my ballot. Show up well-dressed, act respectful to the other team, and maintain a professional atmosphere throughout the round. Have fun with it. The skills developed through speech/debate will be carried with you throughout your life and can be applied in any field so take it seriously.

Please ask questions, before the round starts, about my paradigms as well. I am here to help you and improve the judging experience as best I can.
