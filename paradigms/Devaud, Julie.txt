  I am a policy minded judge, excited to hear the flow of whatever argument is presented to me. I especially enjoy an engaging narrative to lead me into the substance of the debate topic. Your presentation style and level of self-confidence is important to me. I don't want to be dazzled, but I do want to be persuaded with panache and solid evidence.
