  I am a first time parent judge. Please go slowly and be very clear. Do not spread. The faster you go, the more likely I am to miss something.

I expect LD rounds to be as if two lawyers were arguing their cases to the judge to convince me their arguments are the better of my two choices.

Do no run or use any Ks, CPs, DAs, and no LARPing. I know enough to know the names but not how to apply or judge them.

Make my job easy. Voters should be clear and easy to follow. Provide clear weighing mechanism.

If I do not understand your points and positions then you run the risk of confusing me more than your opponent has. Stay topical and link your arguments back to topic.

Please be courteous throughout the round including cross-ex. I will give low speaker points to those who are abrasive, dominating, rude, yelling, etc.
