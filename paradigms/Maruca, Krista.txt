  Background
Krista competed nationally in LD debate from 2003-2007 for Hopkins High in Minnesota. Competitions in which she placed at the varsity level include competitions at Berkeley, Omaha, the Iowa Caucus, Blake, and others. Her style included traditional case structures and kritiks, and cutting cards from books by philosophers such as Locke, Rawls, Kant, Nozick, Arendt and Chompsky have continued to influence her outlook on life and work. Krista also debated parliamentary in college for American University for one year, and took home first place at the Columbia tournament.

L-D Judge Paradigm
The Harvard tournament in 2017 will be the first tournament that Krista has judged for since 2009. In general, she is looking for:
1. Clarity and fully developed, well-articulated arguments. Don't assume that because I know Locke, you can mention the idea and move on. Be clear about the reason you bring in an argument and what exactly the point is you're trying to make (ie. give clear warrants and impacts)
2. Crystalize! While a long list of individual arguments is fine, do your best to tie them together to make a cohesive structure and remind me of why they all matter. Weighing is important.
3. Be polite. This is supposed to be fun, so don't antagonize your opponent or do something to make me not like you.
4. Feel free to get creative. While you can do a lot with a traditional case structure, I'll listen to kritiks, plan/counterplans and other progressive case structure. I have no preference. Speed is fine.
