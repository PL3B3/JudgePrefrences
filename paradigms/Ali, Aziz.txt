  I debated at Clear Lake/Brook for four years and currently debate at New York University.

Debate what you are best at debating. I don't have a personal disposition to any argument. Though I prefer a policy debate over a critical debate, if the K is debate intelligently I have absolutely no problems.

T - I do listen to topicality as long as the violation is legit. What I mean by that is that it should be an argument that you aren't just running as a time suck and it actually makes sense as to why it's being run.

Theory - I love the theory debate. As long as you can prove why there is in round abuse or what not, I will listen.

K - If you can articulate it well, then I will listen.

All in all, I will listen to any intelligible argument. And I have no problem with speed. Make sure you go line by line and compare evidence. I want a discussion of you vs them, not you OR them.
