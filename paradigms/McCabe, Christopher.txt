  I tend to vote on strong links. If there it is a generic link and the AFF can prove that it is a stretch then I tend to side with AFF. I also will vote on T and Framework as long as it is well developed and well impacted. If it is run as a time suck and the 1AR virtually drops it, but it was not well developed in the block then it becomes moot. I am not a big fan of running AFF K's or K's that have little defense other than FWK. It is hard for teams to argue against a K that allows them to simply grab a ballot, because they are making a statement that the other team just can't argue against. In the end, I need a nice package of what to vote on. Don't make me do the work off my flow. Do the work off yours.
