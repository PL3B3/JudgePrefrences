You can make whatever arguments you want, and I will try to judge the debate as fairly as I can.

I judge based on my flow, which is not always the same thing as what you said. I flow on paper, and I only use capital letters, so I can't write very quickly. Please slow down

I will vote for T/FW against K affs. I will also vote for K affs against T.

If you are going for T, I am usually more persuaded by fairness impacts than skills impacts.
If you are aff against T, think about whether your offense is an impact turn to debating about this topic or just a critique of common affs. Make clear what assumptions about the US, China, etc. being topical would force you to defend, then impact turn that. The link is the most important part.

I have a shallow understanding of many K concepts. I am interesting in hearing new concepts, but you have to start at the introductory level with me.

I will vote on an argument only if I can explain it to the other team.

Debate arguments are usually neither sufficient nor necessary, just contributing. I am most compelled by debaters who read fewer cards and find the logical holes in their opponentsâ€™ arguments.

I am not a great judge for "conditionality bad". You can try it, though. I am more sympathetic to this argument in LD.
