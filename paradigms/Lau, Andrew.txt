I debated for 3 years at Lakeville South High School and currently judge on a regular basis.

Speed-I can flow moderate speed but nothing too brisk. The biggest indicator of if you are going to fast is to look up at me and see if I am flowing or not.

Theory-I never ran theory and am only learning through judging how it operates in the round. I would prefer not to hear it because I’m not comfortable judging it yet.

General- I look to the standards and evaluate the round based on who has the clearer link. It doesn’t matter if you are “winning” a lot of arguments if you don’t link them. I will ultimately vote for who had a clearer link to the standards and weighed their arguments well. I prefer well developed arguments over many short arguments.
