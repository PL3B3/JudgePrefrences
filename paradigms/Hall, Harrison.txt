Stolen from Sam Franz's philosophy:
"-I like specific, nuanced, and technical debates. I'll try to leave my argumentative predispositions and preferences out of judging.
-I am unfamiliar with the high school topic. Please be slow with acronyms, don't make any assumptions about 'community consensus,' etc.
-After judging a few debates I found that I am extremely unlikely to read evidence unless its meaning is contested.
-Truths are settled by the arguments made in a debate. I'll probably vote on anything, provided that it is substantiated.
-Strong, definitive, and specific contextualization of link arguments (for a disadvantage, critique, or whatever) will both boost speaker points and increase the persuasiveness of your argument.
-I don't think that I have a very strong slant in framework debates. I generally prefer judges who don't have strong ideological presumptions, so I'll try to keep mine out of the debate...I like framework debates when both sides pick a narrow set of offense that is explained well in relation to the other team's arguments. Often, framework debates lack good impact calculus which makes it hard to decide without considerable intervention."

Things I'd enjoy seeing in a debate (not saying these are necessarily round winners, but they're fun):
- Post-round me: arguing with the judge can teach both parties a lot, and it's exciting
- Dedev
- Space colonization bad
- Word pics
- Condo bad 2ARs
- Recutting opponents cards
- Logical CPs with small net benefits: they're usually super strategic, if the CP actually solves the case
- Neg abusing theory

Things I would not enjoy seeing in a debate:
- Complex theoretical kritiks (Baudrillard-esque, Psychoanalysis, etc.)
- Being mean to partners or opponents
- Intentionally not responding to questions in cross-ex/wasting time
- Bad jokes

Things people care about that I'm ambivalent on:
- Afropess/Race Ks
- Queerness Ks
- Whether or not the 1AC has a plan
