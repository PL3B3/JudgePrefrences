  Background: I debated for 4 years at Robbinsdale Cooper High School, and graduated in 2013. I’m currently an assistant coach at Robbinsdale Armstrong High School.

When I render a decision in a round, I look for the following things:
Be clear, you don’t need to talk super slow, but I want to be able to understand what you’re saying.EXTEND. You should be clearly extending and linking this back to a criterion. If you are not doing all the parts of an extension, then that makes it difficult to use when evaluating a round.Voters. They should be clearly present at the end of your 2NR and 2AR, TELL ME WHY I should be voting for you.Don’t run theory. Just don’t. If there is clear abuse, you can just BREIFLY mention it as an overview, and it has to be ACTUAL, CLEAR abuse.If you do a backflip in round, I will give you a 30. If you make a good reference to Greys Anatomy you will get a 29 or 30, depending on how good the reference is.
