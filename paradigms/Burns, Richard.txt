Lincoln-Douglas judge paradigm:

I prefer straight-forward values clash within a framework of clear value criteria.  I seldom respond well to critique cases.  I like a good mix of real-world evidence and strong philosophical underpinnings.  

I do NOT like speed.  Debate is a communicative event and anything much faster than a normal talking pace reduces the effectiveness of the communication.  I also do not like spread cases, as I feel they generally substitute quantity for quality, and invite one-way hash arguments.  Hitting the broad side of a barn with a shotgun does not make one a marksman.  Give me a case focused on a handful of solid, well-reasoned, evidence-supported arguments and you will do well.
