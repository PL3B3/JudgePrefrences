  Welcome, 

First some background on me, and then I'll digress into what I look for as a judge. I debated SC for two years in high school while dabbling in PF, LD, and policy based debates. I am now a junior at the University of Central Florida, and actively use my debate experience to form logical argumentative discussions for nearly all my courses. 

As a judge, I prefer to put myself in an objective and uniformed situation, where I can accurately get a sense of the grater argument styles being incorporated. Talking fast and jam packing the floor with information just to get your argument out there is ineffective in real life situations and so I treat it as such. I expect a clear and precise recollection of facts and figures, but will only reward good speakers based on the merits of the argument style, confidence, and overall ability. Cross Ex is a big indicator for this, so I expect debaters to think on their feet and actively navigate, and avoid dodging any information thrown towards them.
