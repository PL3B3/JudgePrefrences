  Ayyyyyyy

So I'm Iksha. I've thought about what I would write for my paradigm as a judge since I first started debating, but now I don't really how to even put this all together so I'll just say stuff.

Here's a little background first:
I'm a junior at Cypress Bay High School. I've always done LD; I love the event and I love debate just as a whole. Debate has been a huge part of my life since 8th grade, I started competing as a freshman and have broken at several bid tournaments since.

The real shit:
FRAMEWORK IS IMPORTANT. Give me SOME way to evaluate the round, I don't care what it is, I just need something. You can concede to your opponents framework, you can provide your own, whatever.
That being said, unless it is functioning as offense in the round, I will not vote on framework. It just gives me the lens to evaluating the arguments in the round.
