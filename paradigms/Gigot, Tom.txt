  I practice law for a living, and have done so for thirty years. I judge LD debates in much the way that a court-room judge decides disputed legal arguments. That means I want a clear, concise and well-reasoned explanation of your case. Speaking quickly does not score points with me. To the contrary, if you speak too quickly, I will likely miss important content of your presentation. This will cost you points.

Have a great tournament.
