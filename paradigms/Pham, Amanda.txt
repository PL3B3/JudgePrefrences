I have only judged on this topic at the Wake Early Bird tournament. That said I do not have much experience or knowledge of the topic. What’s most important to me is not drawing conclusions for either team. Doors should be closed in the rebuttals. I don’t enjoy having to question whether the team I potentially vote for will have intended for me to vote that way on a particular argument-I should be voting for your strategy. Additionally, clean flows are very important to my ability to evaluate the round. Extending a tagline without an author or warrant is very frustrating for my flowing and teams that completely disregard having a clean flow bring much sorrow to my life. 

As a debater I have been more prone to running topicality or critical arguments but that does not mean I would like you to do the same. I would like debaters to do what they are best at rather than attempting to accommodate me. 

Framework and Theory arguments should be read at a slower pace than cards.

There is a difference between being assertive and being rude, just because you say something over your opponents response to your cross ex question doesn't mean they don't have a response. It simply means you can speak louder than they can. Feel free to ask any further questions prior to the round. I would love to answer them.



 Sincerely,

 Amanda Pham
