  I coach at the Archer School for Girls in Los Angeles. I've judged at circuit tournaments for the past three years.

In general, I'm open-minded walking into a debate, and I'm up for whatever case you choose to run, so long as it is well defended and you are able to engage with all of the material you present in your constructive. If it's clear that you're running something that you either didn't write or don't understand, odds are not in your favor, no matter how good it sounds on paper.

Please engage with your opponent's case. Avoid purely definition-based debates. I prefer clash on framework and evidence (and lots of it).

I'm fine with spreading as long as I can understand you. If you're going so fast that your opponent can't understand you, odds are I am also struggling. Be sure to signpost, especially tag lines and sources.

I don't love theory arguments unless there is clear abuse on your opponent's side. I'd much prefer you engage with the argument to the best of your ability. If your opponent's case is truly abusive, I'm probably already leaning your way.

Be polite to your opponent and to me. No need to shake my hand, no need to formally thank anyone before the round a la an acceptance speech. Rude behavior, condescension, shouting, etc. will impact your speaker points.

I love philosophical debates. Be sure your impacts clearly link to your framework and that your choices are fully justified.

Good luck!
