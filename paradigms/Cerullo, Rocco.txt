  I accept theory debate and occasionally welcome it. I don't prefer spreading, but can follow it. Just interested in a good round that doesn't become too complicated. Have fun!
Higher Speaks for:
Interesting/Quality framework debate
As much weighing as possible
Laid-back manner. Please just have fun!
Make me think, show me something I haven't seen or thought of before
Lower Speaks for:
Rude treatment of opponent, especially in-round. Please be courteous, this is a debate, not a mudslinging
No consideration of novices. If your case clearly can't be understood by someone considered "new", try to be more simple when pitted against opponents that are such a way.
Personal views:
Affirm/Negate the topic
K's/Critiques need frameworks
I'm impartial to almost every view, I love being proven there are other ways to look at something
I'm not sympathetic
Civility is important
I LOVE confident speaking
I mainly default to Util
Random comments:
I'm better at following fast util debates rather than Kantian ones. I think and speak very quickly, but I will not follow you nearly as quickly. Speak clearly, and I will say "SLOW" or "CLEAR" if I feel I'm missing something or can't keep up.
Clarify impacts, please.
I'm not the best debater, in fact, I'm nearly horrid compared to most advanced LD debaters, so go easy on me. I'll do my best to evaluate the round correctly and truthfully, but please forgive me if I miss or cannot follow your arguments and you lose the round based on a mistake I make. I understand that pain, so please understand as well. I'm freshly out of high school as well, so, I haven't been judging too much.
DO NOT LET THE DEBATE BECOME HOSTILE.
If you have any other questions, please email me at "rcerullomuse@gmail.com", and I will get back to you as soon as I have time. Please enjoy yourselves, and don't be too nervous. Confidence is key.
