  I am a parent judge from Claremont High School. I have been judging now for 3 years. I am a lay judge. However, I am not so much about the presentation as the argument itself. Don’t spread, that is if you want me to flow your arguments (meaning if I don’t write something down due to issues with clarity or speed I am less likely to consider it). Please read your authors names clearly (qualifications are also very nice), it makes signposting easier throughout the round. I make my decisions after careful deliberation after the round, and for that reason I don’t disclose. I also don’t like giving feedback before the ballot is written (as to prevent a debater’s intervention after the round.) I am open to diverse case positions and will be able to handle complicated ideas if they are well explained. Be very clear in your constructive. Please avoid theory unless you can make a clear case for a REAL abuse within the round, paragraph theory is preferable in those circumstances. I do keep a flow of arguments but I recommend you signpost VERY clearly. The bottom line: lay out whatever argument you are making very clearly, if I cannot understand your argument I am less likely to vote on it.

Good Luck! Debate is fun, keep it that way J

P.S. if you bring spectators into the round, they must have good manners and embody respect for both debaters/teams… (bad experience at state quals last year)
