In an LD round, whoever achieves the accepted value and value criterion better will win the round. I’m traditional in that I do like you to debate the framework. Don’t ignore it and flow it through the round.
I value clash. Make sure you’re attacking your opponent’s case equally to defending yours. Give me line-by-line analysis and impact analysis. It’s nice if you tell me your voters, but if you don’t, I’ll fall back to the framework debate and who achieves it better.
I don’t prefer speed. I can handle it to an extent but be clear and enunciate. If you’re going too fast I’ll tell you.
I prefer you don’t do flex prep. Cross-ex is for questions, not prep time.
Counterplans are okay, I’m less familiar with Kritiks. If you’re going to run it, make sure you explain it well.
I won't disclose, the ballot has the information you need.
