  Qualifications: debated 4 years in high school, LD state champ 2005, 3rd in state 2004, numerous invitational wins, TOC quals, coached after high school, current lawyer.

Philosophy: It's the debaters job to tell me how to judge the round by establishing the most appropriate v and vc for the round or topic and showing how their arguments matter within that framework. I don't mind speed but I prefer logic and persuasion.
