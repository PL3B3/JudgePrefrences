I try to be as tab as possible but I'll default policymaker if no framework and role of the ballot are presented and extended. Some general points:

- T is fine as long as it's not an obvious time suck (please don't run time suck arguments)
- K's are totally cool, I'm a philosophy major, but you need to assume I haven't read your author and explain every facet of your argument to me as if I'm five. Also, if you want to run a K you need to give me a framework and distinct role of the ballot and probably win both to win the round (there are a couple of really specific exceptions to that last part but don't gamble your W on them).
- I'll listen to any performance argument, just win framework and role of the ballot
- Tech is important for both speaks and the W, don't get lazy with your extensions/cross applications
- Speed's cool, I'll tell you to clear and go easy on me early in the season
- Sarcasm is cool, being straight up rude is not. Don't make the room uncomfortable by being a jerk or your speaks will suffer and I'll look for reasons to down you.
- Racism, sexism, and vulgarity are grounds for zero speaks and an immediate loss. You can curse within reason, just don't make it uncomfortable
- If you actually debate warrants instead of throwing tags at me and saying "and that's why that argument falls" I might just cry tears of joy
- I'll give detailed critiques after the round and disclose unless the people paying me say otherwise

Specific questions just ask in the room
