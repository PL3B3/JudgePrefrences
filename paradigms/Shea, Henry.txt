  In general, I prefer a more traditional style of LD debate. I enjoy compelling philosophical argumentation, value/criterion clash, creative rebuttal responses, and the use of clear, persuasive communication. Also, be sure to crystallize at the end of the round, weigh the issues, and offer at least a few voters.

I place a high value upon clarity and am not keen on speed. If I am not able to effectively take notes on a given argument, it won't be factored into my decision. In like measure, though I am not categorically averse to alternative ways of approaching a resolution, e.g. theory, kritiks, etc., they had better be well-reasoned and effectively argued if I am to consider them as a major factor in the round. Also, professionalism, kindness and mutual respect are always appreciated.
