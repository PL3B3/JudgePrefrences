  I am a parent judge, not a philosopher/debate genius. I have judged many rounds on the JV national circuit, so I am comfortable with moderate speed but not spreading. If you are gasping, that's too fast for me. Remember, I have limited experience judging so please try to stick to debating about the topic. I understand common frameworks and ones that are well explained.That being said, I evaluate rounds based on the winning framework. The winning debater will link his case into the winning framework better than his opponent.
