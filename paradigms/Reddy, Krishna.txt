  This paradigm is written by Samir Reddy (my son). I’ll be judging at the Alta tournament on the November December topic.
Quick version while for while you’re filling out prefs
I’m a parent judge
No spreading
No theory
Not very knowledgeable about philosophy
Before the round
1. No spreading-The big picture matters more anyways so you shouldn’t need to spread to cover every argument on the line by line.
2. My knowledge of theory is literally zero. You should frame your theory arguments in terms of what the burdens of the aff and neg are and they shouldn’t be a shell. Avoiding theory is probably best.
3. I don’t know a lot if anything about philosophy. 
4. I’m a pediatrician, so I know a decent amount about insurance and healthcare, but I won’t insert my personal views into what happens in the round. This also means focusing the debate on the topic will go a long way with me as opposed to spending all your time on the value and value criterion.
5. At the end of the day, perceptual dominance is what will get you the win in front of me.
