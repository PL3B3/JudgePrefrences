  Hi,

I judge policy. I debated policy for a couple of years in high school. I do not have great topic knowledge for this year (Cal invitational is my first tournament for this topic.) I am a little rusty but should be able to follow along if you make it easy for me. Please only spread if you are extremely clear. Above all, try to be courteous and respectful of all the other debaters and myself. Keep in mind how privileged and fortunate everyone here is for the opportunity to participate in this activity. Don't stress, be nice, do your best, and have fun!!! :)

Please do not bring up new evidence in rebuttals; I'd much more greatly prefer analytics/comparison of evidence in the second half of the debate. 

You can ask me any specific questions you have, but I'm pretty much OK with anything but keep in mind I'm rusty so try to be very clear, sign-post, and explain what you're doing each step of the way.
