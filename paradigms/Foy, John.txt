  I am the assistant coach at Saint Francis High School and I deal largely with the Lincoln Douglas team.

I debated policy in college but did LD in high school in a place where it was largely an oratorical event.

Preference:

I have lots, so ask me, but I usually try to keep them away from the debate.

The single most important preference I have is that I can understand you. LD debaters often read answers that are too short, too quickly, with too little analysis. I often cannot flow these ridiculous "arguments" and when I can they seem to have little or no real warrants.In short, I am old, slow down.

I like, I mean really like, philosophy, but kind of hate analytic philosophy. Continental philosophy is welcome. The best case I've seen in two years was a Deleuze aff on the Juvenile crime topic.

I REALLY REALLY REALLY like theology. If you have a theological argument, especially one based in Catholicism, to make then I think I will understand what you have to say.

Please don't say stupid things. Barring that, don't say stupid things exclusively.

Please let your opponent see your evidence. If you are reading from a computer please have an electronic copy ready before you begin so your opponent can look at it during your speech. Please provide it in a format that is readable on all computers (ie word)

Jump-time/Prep time- I don't make any special allowance for electronic debate. All jumping/moving things around/format problems come out of someone's prep time.

My points are not very high. They will become lower if you ask me what points you got.


I mostly just judge rounds as they happen and am not too concerned with a round being exactly what I want (caveat emptor on speed above).


Any other questions? Ask.
