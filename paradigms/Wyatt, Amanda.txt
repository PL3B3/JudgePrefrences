  LD is value debate; meaning it's based in present time as a tool to weigh our values in current society and decide our ethical actions. This means that the debate ought to be weighed more heavily by framework and normative arguments than empirical statistics. Each contention must be addressed, but individual cards under the contention can be dropped without penalty.
Connect all of your arguments with your framework, and weigh your value against your opponent's. 
Follow the flow, and make it as easy as possible on me to follow in my own notes.
Don't spread - LD is just as much about being a persuasive speaker as it is about clean logic.
Philosophy: We're here to learn. The resolutions are written in such a way that there is no ultimate "right" answer, so simply stick to your case, and argue through as best you can.
My judging is based upon technical aspects first, then speaking skills.
