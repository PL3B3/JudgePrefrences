  My name is Dan Johnson and I was a circuit debater for four years. I am also only one year out, so I don't claim to be the expert on debate. I understand most positions, but ALWAYS want a clear presentation of case. I am fine with speed, but I cannot handle a lack of clarity. If I can't understand you, I can't flow you. If I can't flow, your arguments don't matter. As for kritiks and such, they are fine. The only thing I want is a clear framework to evaluate the round (whether it be V/CR or some other framework) and a story of how you meet it. Topicality is also fine as long as you run it correctly. If you run a T and don't have a violation, I will be mad.

Things to do to win: Have a strong framework with clear extensions of OFFENSE.

Things to do to lose: Slur your words, don't have warrants, or incorrectly run your own position.
