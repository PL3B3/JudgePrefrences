Background: I have judged Lincoln Douglas Debate for 2 1/2 years and Public Forum when needed. I am a Traditional Judge.
 
Jargon/Theory: I suggest you stay away from debate slang and theory. I strongly urge you to explain everything you say as well as you can.
 
Speed: Please do not spread/speed read; try to speak clearly as possible. Also, try to change your intonations as you flow from one contention to the next or as you switch between a card and your own text.
 
Judging the round: Whoever defends his/her own case better and attacks his/her opponent's case better will win the round. Its not the number of arguments you make, but rather the quality of of the arguments that you make that will matter the most. I'm looking for well-argued, (civil), rational arguments. I recommend that you employ philosophical and logical arguments while not losing focus on values.
 I flow throughout the round and list out the arguments for and against the topic. Do the arguments for outweigh the arguments against? I also consider the value and criteria presented in deciding which side's arguments are more important.
