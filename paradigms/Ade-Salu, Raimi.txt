  Debate Experience: 6 months

I am fairly new to debate, actually very new. I currently attend Binghamton University and have joined their debate program since August of 2010. 

As far as arguments go, I will vote on anything (cp, kritik, procedurals, etc.) provided you win your arguments on the flow. I will not do the "work" for you on the flows, but instead I want you to provide me with a case of why your team should when over the other. 

I enjoy cross-ex's, and to me it is binding as long as it is brought back up into the speeches. 


Thanks,

Raimi Ade-Salu


p.s.- Go slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww on the TAGS!!!
