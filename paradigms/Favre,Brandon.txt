General: Run whatever you want. If you run something sketch like Solar Anus or Time Cube, you'd better know what you're doing. Speed is fine as long as you're clear. In LD, I prefer traditional argumentation, but I'll weigh anything that you read. Education is a dumb voter, but I'll entertain it if you run it.
