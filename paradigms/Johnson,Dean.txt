  I am a former high school and collegiate policy debater (NDT Qualifier) and debate coach. I believe debate is a contest of argumentation. I am open to any form of argumentation and appreciate well-reasoned, well-presented arguments. I believe everything is debateable. I count on the debaters, not my philosophy or prejudices, to determine the outcome of the debates I judge.
