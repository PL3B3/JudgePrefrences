Go slow and don't spread in front of me. I prefer a policy debates not k. Be sure to explain your argument very well. Tell me why I should vote for you on an argument. Pretend policy is public forum and you should be fine. 
I will default to T UsFg if you are reading a k aff
I usually default to reasonability for every other T shell
