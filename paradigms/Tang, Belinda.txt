  I debated LD for four years in high school both locally and nationally, and I'm currently a student at Stanford. 

In general, I'll vote off of any argument as long as its well-explained and well-impacted throughout the course of the round. I evaluate rounds based on an offense defense model. I don't mind speed but I probably can't handle you going at your top speed either....I will yell "clear" during a round if this becomes a problem. I will vote off theory if there's actual abuse during the round but I'm very annoyed with theory that is used just as a timesuck. 


Don't be rude and I probably won't give you anything lower than 27.5.
