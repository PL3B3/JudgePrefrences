   Graduated from Baltimore Talent Development in 2008
I debated for three years locally and nationally.  I debated in both the NFL and BCFL.  I debated at Big Bronx, Villager, Harvard Invitational etc...
I am an open slate, I love to see great rounds with lots of clash.  I take points for profanity and any arguments that are racially insensitive 

I am open to any and all arguments and do not bring my personal beliefs into the round.  I am a fan of both Kritical and Traditional debate.  I hardly ever vote on topicality or ground unless the other team absolutely loses on this.  I value passionate advocacy and am open to performance debate.  I just love to see a great round!!!!

As far as kritics are concerned, I value the basis of your alternative and need for you to explain to me how your criticisms function in the real world and how you getting my ballot inside of the round affects the real world.  

For more traditional teams, please explain how your framework is better than your opponent and should be evaluated ahead of theirs and how it best benefits debate and or the real world.

Cheers
