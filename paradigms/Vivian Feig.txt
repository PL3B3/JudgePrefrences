  Paradigm:

I did LD for 4 years for Torrey Pines High School, and traveled quite a bit on the national circuit, including the TOC. I'm a sophomore at Columbia now and I've judged at Yale, Princeton, Bronx Science, VBT, and the Archer Round Robin, so I've had a good amount of judging experience for a first year out, I think.

I'm fine with speed and all that, and I'm fine with any "alternative" forms of argumentation, theory, etc. It is very important that you give me some clear standard or other form of evaluative mechanism that I can look to at the end of the round, and if there are multiple of these, that you prioritize them for me. It is also very important that you extend warrants and explicitly impact to said standard/evaluative mechanism.

My speaker points are based more on your strategic choices than anything, but obviously things like how clear you are or how loud you speak factor into how easily I can comprehend what arguments you're trying to make. I won't yell "clear" but my body language is usually really really obvious, so look at me from time to time.

Other than that, have fun and be courteous to one another!
