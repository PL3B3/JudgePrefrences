  Background: I debated LD for four years at Arroyo Grande High School.

Spreading: I’m generally okay with spreading—just slow down for author names and tag lines. If you speed through a list of tags I may miss some and they won’t get on the flow. If you’re just blazing through and I don’t understand, I’ll just stop flowing. This is your cue to slow it down. I will only yell clear once.

Theory, Kritik, CPs, etc.: I’m fine with any of these alternative techniques, as long as you explain yourself clearly. However, keep in mind that I don’t judge on the creativity of an argument—I vote on the logic of it. It’s a debate first and foremost—keep it logical and clean.

At the end of the day, I’m a relatively traditional judge in that the flow means everything to me. I expect you to go through it with me before the end of the round, and your performance in explaining the impact and weighing of your arguments is crucial.

Also, here’s the obligatory “Don’t be too intense—have fun” advice. Seriously, have fun!
