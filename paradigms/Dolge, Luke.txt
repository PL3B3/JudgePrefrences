Policy Maker.

Kritiks: I have an extremely high kritik threshold. If the kritik can
uniquely link to the affirmative, and show a measurable growth of
harms in the SQ as a result of the plan, I might be inclined to listen
to the kritik if you can explain how the alternative works.

Topicality: I lean towards reasonability, negs should be able to prove
abuse for a ballot.

Good rounds in my view would include:

Strong impact calculus on both sides.
A clear negative strategy.
A 1AC that is present after the 1AC.
Both sides analyzing the warrants of important cards in the round.
Consistent structure and clash.
