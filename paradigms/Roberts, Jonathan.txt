  I am an undergraduate student and former LD debater.

I come into every round without any foundational biases. If you want to run a traditional case, do it. If you want to run a K, do it. If you want to run a counter plan, do it. All I need from you is a method through which to evaluate the round. If you do not provide that crucial lens, then I have to be prejudicial in the way that I judge (which may be to your benefit or detriment). Unless you give me a reason, I generally will not vote exclusively off of theory. 

I can handle spreading, but that does not mean you should sacrifice clarity when needed. I can only judge the arguments that I flow, so if I miss information, it is most likely due to your delivery.

Signposting is absolutely necessary. Don't force me to do more work than I need to - tell me exactly where and what you are arguing. Again, I can only judge the arguments that I flow.

I will try to do as little work as possible, in so far as I am merely copying down the arguments that you are making onto my own flow pad. It is ultimately up to you to win the round. If I have to do more work than necessary, that not only detracts from the debate, but also from the educational process.
