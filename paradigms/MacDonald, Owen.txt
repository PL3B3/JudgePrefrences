General: I think the aff should defend an instrumental implementation of the resolution. It allows for a fair, in depth debate to occur. Everything is debatable though. I view most debates through an offense/defense lens.

-Topicality is a voting issue, never a reverse voting issue. I default to competing interpretations. 
-More people should read/go for the politics disad
-neg gets Ks
-stealing prep hurts your speaks, know how laptops work and don't take forever to save speech docs.
-Conditionality is good
