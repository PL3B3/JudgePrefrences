  I'm tab as a judge so I'll listen to anything, especially different and new kinds of theory. If you can justify your argument and impact it out then run it. I do not like conditional arguments and really don't understand why the negative destroys debate this way.  Pick a strategy and stick with it, just read a mountain of cards and have multiple impact scenarios. Do not ever run a Politics DA unless you wrote it yourself and can extend on your impacts.  I will listen to T, but don't waste my time trying to convince me that the word "of" means "commercial."
