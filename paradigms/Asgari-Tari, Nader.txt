I default to a policy making paradigm. 

Affirmatives: T is important, you do not NEED to have a plan, but at least an advocacy statement and be tangentially related to the topic.

CP: PICs are cool - just justify your competition early on, definitely needs a net benefit. 

K: Do what you please, just contextualize your links and alternative to the affirmative. Do not assume I know what literature you draw from.

T: Default to resonability on T. If you're going for T in the 2NR, please take time to impact each standard and do adequate comparisons.

Have fun, be nice to each other! :)
