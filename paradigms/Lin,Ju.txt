  This is my first year judging, so not much experience.
I think speakers should be organized and provide a road map. Tags should be clearly stated and concise. If you speak so fast that I don't catch your arguments, then it's your bad, not mine. I believe that this activity should teach speaking skills and improve an individual's ability to persuade. I'm open to any argument as long as it is explained clearly. Speakers should be polite.
