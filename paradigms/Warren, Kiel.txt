  Hi, my name is Kiel Warren.

I am an English teacher at Corona del Sol High School, and I know the basics of argumentation.

I'm fairly new, so go slow and make sure to speak clearly. Enunciation is important for me.

At the end of the round, I'll vote for the person who better articulates their argument, not the person who I like better. I'll vote for the position better articulated, not the position that I may agree with.

I know how to evaluate speaker points, but morally questionable comments will result in low speaker points. Ad hom's and other rude comments will also lower points.

I've been briefed on the topic, but make sure to not assume anything about my level of familiarity.

All in all, I'll come in with a clean slate - just argue well, be nice, and we'll all be happy.
