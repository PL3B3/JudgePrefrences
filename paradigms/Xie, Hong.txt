  Hi,
I'm a parent judge with some but not much experience in LD

I try to be tabula rasa, and will vote off of any argument as long as it is clearly warranted (as long as it is not blatantly offensive, otherwise I will drop you with low speaks). I would not call myself traditional, but even though I will try my best I may not understand some of the more nuanced arguments, so please make sure to warrant your arguments as strongly and clearly as possible.

Please give me clear voters at the end of each speech! I am much more likely to vote for the debater who gives me clear places to vote.

I will NOT appreciate speed, as it will be difficult to follow and flow your arguments.

Good luck and I look forward to good rounds!
