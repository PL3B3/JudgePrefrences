  I am open to hearing all types of arguments, but in the world of debate, the empirical will trump even the most logical analytics. Ideally you will use evidence to back up your analytics.
I don't care much about your speed so long as you remain coherent and your opponent and I understand your arguments. I would also recommend that you slow down (so as to make it coherent), if you are a fast reader, when you are reading your taglines.

Let me know why. Why you win, why I should prefer your reasoning, why I should prefer your literature. Don't leave me hanging and make me connect all the dots. Do the impact calculus (probability, magnitude, timeline, etc). Debate is an intellectual exercise, so treat it like one.
