I did Lincoln Douglas style debate on the Wisconsin State Circuit and National Circuit for two years. Prior to that I did policy debate. My experience is mostly traditional, but policy helped me to get better at that aspect of "modern" LD on the national circuit. I like to think I generally adapt to most styles well.

I don't really have any severe argument restraints, just be clear and concise in your final rebuttals. 

I would be happy to answer any other questions before the round.
