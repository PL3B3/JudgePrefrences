About me:

I've only done critical debate and do not often read plans or advocacy texts very often but that does not mean I'm against them while judging a debate. 


Overview:
I'm very openminded in the back of a room I will hear any and all arguments with no bias. I expect an full explanation of these arguments just saying the AFF is violent does nothing is not enough for me. I will not connect the dots I will let yall do that for me I may know what you mean but if you don't explain it to me therefore I cant vote on it. I'm open to all types of debate I have no strict definition of what debate should look like if you want to rap, dance, sing, read a poem by all means go ahead just make sure you are able to connect them to your arguments please. In round please do more then just read a bunch of cards very fast please stop and explain some of these cards and relate them back to your argument. During CX I do flow and I do pay close attention to everything said in CX. 
Lastly your ethos wins you debates more than you would think.
