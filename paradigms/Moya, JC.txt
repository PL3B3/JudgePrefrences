  I believe LD to be the highest form of debate available to the high school student, who wishes to combine rhetorical and oratorical excellence and philosophical acuity. I am adaptable to the needs of the round. Regarding speed, the debater who attempts to spread NEEDS to be clear, and should save me the worry of having to call for an emergency oxygen supply. In other words, know what you are doing if you attempt to spread. I will frown heavily upon the use of "dirty tricks" by any debater which attempts to gain an unfair advantage, (such as speeches printed on miniscule font, etc). I don't mind the use of kritiks, if they are used tastefully constructed and within reason. Don't walk into a round which I am judging and attempt to argue that genocide is ok, for example. Ultimately, I let the debaters do their thing without getting in the way, as long as the students are being courteous and ethical with one another.
