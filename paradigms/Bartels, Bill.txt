  Expectations/Philosophy

Simple Rules: Breathe, Posture, Articulation, Collaboration

Breathe: Never Over Rated!
Posture: Civility is an expectation.
Articulation: Speak clearly if spreading, make it clear.
Collaboration: This is a debate between two affirmative arguments. The affirmative and the negative. Expect crystallization to the resolution, clash, engagement between the arguments.

Fine with Theory, and alternatives. They must link and impacts must link to the case and resolution. Attempting to spread an opponent out of the debate is abuse and will be judged as such.

Use words, not, LD or Policy form speak. If what you are saying can be stated in words. Use words not shorthand. Filler words such as um, ah, basically, are distracting and will result in lower scores. If Spreading (Smearing) remember that volume (both in sound level and amount of data) directly applied and at a higher level neither make a point nor are an argument. If you are using this technique use it with clarity. Also, if the idea is to throw so much against the wall so that your opponent can’t possibly win for dropping things, you are not making an affirmative case, you are making a mud case. Won’t win. Running Armageddon generally doesn’t win. Philosophical or theory arguments are fine as long as they are tied to the topic and the argument. If they are just arguments they may experience armageddon. If you are going to talk about “Voters” talk in terms of your arguments and your crystallization. Be specific. If debating back to a point in the flow, us words to remind to the specific argument. Sub-point B or the “Fred Card” will not do it. Respect for opponents and the forms leads to higher scores. I want to hear and see your best! Personal Experience: Started playing in Mock UN in 1974, work in public policy, public agency coaching, organizational development and farming systems so have an expectation that things are connected to well thought through systems.
