Experience
2 Years debating at Sachse Highschool (Local )
2 Years debating Jenks ( National circuit ) -
Qualified to the TOC my senior year
Freshman debating at OU


General
- Don't tell me to call for like 30 cards after the round , pick and choose which one you think will win you the round
- Don't be hostile
- Don't say racist , sexist , ableist , homophobic and other bad things
- Impact framing is important 

T - Great , Went for it alot of my 2nr's during my senior year.
-Tell me what you mean by reasonability because it could mean a ton of things
-Impact out things beyond just assertions

FW - Contrary to my argument choices , i'm probably more neutral on this argument than one would expect.
neg side
- Don't just assert a T-version of the aff without A) Explaining how it solves the aff B) Making sure it meets your own definition of the resolution
- Read a definition of the Verb of the topic please.
- I'm way more persuaded on the Limits/Predictability side of FW compared to the state good/civic engagement debate. If you do choose to read the latter , make sure to explain why its a competitive argument to vote neg for and not just a non competitive cp.
-Less cards and more explanation is usually good
Aff side
-Make actual arguments... Antonio 95 and Fernando does not make a sufficient 2ac block to FW (I know this from experience)
- Use your 1ac as offense against FW and the way they view the world
- 2ac should be answering particular impact modules on FW instead of just reading your same 2ac block
- If you're going for just a few args , make sure to explain how those particular args mean i don't evaluate the other teams args
- Impact things out
- Push on Thresholds/UQ of their impacts
- don't be afraid to call T-version of Affs on not meeting their own interpretation





K - The Other thing most of my 2nr's in highschool were on.
Neg Side
- Actually impact out your links to answer things like the permutation
- Contextualize link arguments to the aff
- I have experience with most high theory K's (Esp Baudrillard, Heidegger ,Derrida , Deleuze and Nietzsche) and a good amount of experience going for colonialism based arguments , but that does not mean i will translate your jargon into arguments.
- Having a case debate usually makes these alot easier to win in the 2nr



Aff side
- Question alt solvency
- Make a smarter arg than no K's allowed
- Do more than just impact turn the K. Tho don't be afraid to go for 6 minutes of that impact turn

K affs
- Always have Da's to the alt , go for more than just link turns and the perm

DA's - I've gone for them , explain impact framing and turns case arguments.


CP - They're fine
I'm generally neutral on most theory arguments
i will vote on condo bad if the aff wins it
