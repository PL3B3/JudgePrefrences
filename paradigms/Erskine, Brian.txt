  General: I especially love PF and Congress, and I hold pretty strictly to the rules because they're in place for a reason. Being a judge, for me, is a lot of fun, and that is why I still do it.

Paradigm: I'm a pretty by-the-book and traditional judge in terms of expectations, but I am open and listening for content from anywhere on the spectrum. 

Speed: Please do not speed read. Debating is about actually exchanging ideas and not reciting a performance. If you cannot be misunderstood then you cannot possibly win. 

Style: Please use appropriate decorum. Teleologies, linguistic banter, and bombardment are tactics I won't consider as winning material.

Arguments: Tell me what you're going to tell me. Then tell me. Then tell me what you told me. 

Technology/Paperless: Please bring several copies of your case instead of playing the computer juggle and wasting time.

LD: LD is a value debate. You must show me how your contentions uphold your V and VC

PF: Not to be confused with Policy, there are no "cards," and unlike LD there are no V or VC. Your job is not to present a pre-canned speech. It is to exchange in debate between two sides. I will flow everything I hear, and I especially notice when teams drop each other's contentions. Most of all, if you're rude or speed read then please understand you will likely not win the round.
