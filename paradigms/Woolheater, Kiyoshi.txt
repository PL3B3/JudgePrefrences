  I debated at Alpharetta High School so I'm fine with most arguments

T: I'm not the biggest fan of the T debate however I will try and make the best decision possible however if the debate gets very technical my ability to make a good decision decreases. unless its T on a nontopical K aff, then I'm all for it 
K: I can judge this debate but that doesn't mean I like it.
CP: Not the biggest fan of agent counterplans, otherwise I'm fine
DA: love 'em.

Theory: Don't like these debates but I will vote on them

Performance affs: never read these and never really understood them. I'm probably not the best judge to read these affs in front of however I will vote on anything that is explained to me properly.
