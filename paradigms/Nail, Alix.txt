  I am currently a sophomore 2A at Westminster and this is my second year of debate. I usually prefer more policy debates but that doesn’t mean you cant read what you want, just be sure to explain it well and, as always, I’ll vote for the better arguments. Read what you’re comfortable with, but try to make it logical/intelligent, otherwise it can be hard to understand and vote on.

General Notes-
 ~Be respectful to the other team, your partner, and me – this doesn’t mean you cant be aggressive and by all means be assertive in the round, but don’t be yelling at other people
~I wont take prep for flashing unless it becomes a problem – we all know how to work flash drives and emails so I don’t expect there to be much delay on this but there are always instances where it happens, I get that
~Don’t steal prep, I will be watching you and even if I don’t say anything, I’ve noticed and it will be reflected in your speaker points
~Have fun and be yourself – debate is ultimately a game that we all partake in so enjoy the experience
~Flowing is very important to do
~Use Cross-ex to your advantage and I will listen to it – reference it in your speeches otherwise it is useless
~Clarity is important – I will say clear but after a while I might give up and stop flowing – sign posting is important
~Impact calc plz :) – more than just “the DA outweighs and turns the case” – you need to explain why – weigh your impacts against theirs – why are yours more important?

Topicality-
 ~T is a good argument if its explained well
~Make sure the impacts are explained well and not just shouting “limits!”
~Please answer the right T violation and please read the right T violation otherwise everyone looks incompetent and the round gets very messy

Disads-
 ~Yup

Counterplans-
 ~Not many CPs are actually “cheating” so if you are going to make that argument you need to give good, legitimate reasons why it is – Consult CPs probably more towards the cheating though
~These are good to read

Kritiks-
 ~I don’t read many Ks but don’t let that affect if you read one in front of me
~Be sure to explain them and make them coherent
~The link is important!! If you can not point out a tangible link to the aff then its hard to persuade me to vote neg – this is the same if you change your link several times
~You should read a framing argument with the shell of the K, otherwise it can be hard to come back from if the aff does a good job at making their framing arguments after your speech – this also goes for the aff who needs to answer the framing arguments otherwise I will err neg on this one

Case-
 ~I like a good case debate
~Use 1AC CX to point out the flaws in the aff
~You should probably have impact defense too and not just attacks on the links/internal links
~Impact turns are great but if you’re going to make an argument that is like “nuclear war good” then you should be prepared to thoroughly explain why/how it is

Theory-
 ~If you want to read theory then do it
~Make smart arguments and don’t just say “fairness” because that gets old very quickly and the theory debate is the same every time – make it interesting and unique and you will have a better chance of winning
~I will default to rejecting the one argument that is said to be bad unless the team tells me otherwise
~Don’t be afraid to be strong on condo and go for it
~Impacts are important here – you have to do impact calc here just like anything else

Jokes-
 ~I like a good laugh so feel free to make jokes as long as it doesn’t take away from your speech or feel forced
~Jokes about Stephanie Zhang, Ribhu Deb, Rush Patel, or my fav Westy peeps will get you some extra speaker points
