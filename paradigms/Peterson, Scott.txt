  My judging paradigm is very basic and strait-forward:
I am not a strict flow judge. I am listening for solid, well-reasoned,
logical arguments. A few really good arguments are probably
better than a lot of minor, irrelevant arguments. Emphasize your
major points and be sure to attack the weaknesses of your opponents
case. If you say something foolish or obviously absurd you will probably
loose the round. LD is not policy, so speed reading cards is not going
to help your case. Left-leaning political arguments are generally not convincing.
Emotional appeals are also not convincing.
