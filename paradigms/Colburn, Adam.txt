  There are 3 things you need to know about my paradigm:

1) I believe that high school policy debate is a communication activity; therefore, I expect a clear explanation of the arguments in the round as well as a clear delivery.
a. I rely heavily on my flows when evaluating the round, so make sure that your most crucial arguments are delivered in an especially clear fashion.
b. If I do not understand your argument (or your delivery)--it is your fault, not mine.

2) I believe that high school policy debate is about policy.
a. If you want to talk about something else, please make sure you can connect it to policy in a meaningful way.
b. The less your arguments have to do with policy, the harder it will be for me to evaluate them.

3) I believe that high school policy debaters should conduct themselves both professionally and amicably
a. Tag-teaming and prompting are neither professional nor amicable.
b. If you do either of these in the round, you will lose speaker points.
