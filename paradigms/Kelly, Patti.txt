  I’ve been a teacher for 25 years and I’m now a parent volunteer who is new to judging LD. As such, I prefer a slower round. If you are spreading, I will place my pen on the desk as a signal for you to slow down.

I expect you to be respectful and civil throughout the debate.

Values are very important so be sure to explain how your Value and Value Criterion support your position on the Resolution and link to one another, and continue to refer to your Value and Value Criterion throughout the round.

Card citation is necessary to prove your argument. Do not simply throw out cards but rather explain and connect them back to your framework/contentions.

All jargon and acronyms should be clearly defined.

Since I will vote based on the voters you provide in your rebuttals, it is your responsibility to convince me that you have won the round.
