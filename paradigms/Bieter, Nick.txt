  Background: Policy debater for STA from 2007 - 2009, UDL policy coach in Chicago from 2009 - 2013
Current conflicts: judge for Roseville since Sept 2014

Paradigm: I'm fairly new to judging LD so slow down for dense philosophy stuff and be emphatic about the impact of framework args. Clearly enunciate author names. I am neutral in regards to truth-testing vs desirability, so if this factors into your case heavily make sure to spend time telling which to prefer. Ditto for competing interps vs reasonability. I've been out of the nat circuit for a while so adjust speed accordingly (however run whatever type of case you want, I have no traditional leanings). All types of policy args are ok; Ks must have a well-defined RoB.
