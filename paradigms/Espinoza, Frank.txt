   I am a parent judge and have judged multiple times. When judging a round I look heavily upon the argumentation of the competitors. Was I able to clearly understand the idea? Where the arguments unique? Where the arguments logical? I like arguments that have both solid statistical backing as well as impacts that are realistic and not a big exaggeration. Style wise I do not like spreading at all and your tone,inflection, and pace play a critical role. I am a fair judge and look forward to a great round.
