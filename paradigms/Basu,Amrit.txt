I think that I do not have any strong predispositions for the most part. Feel free to run whatever arguments you feel comfortable with.

Disads: Running these in front of me is a good idea. I especially like politics disads. Make sure you do warranted impact calculus.

Topicality: I default to competing interpretations unless told otherwise. Both sides must impact their arguments on T. I do not think that topicality is genocide.

Kritiks: I prefer conventional policy debate to kritikal debates but am fine with kritiks if you choose to run them. Make sure you explain your alternative well. Don't expect me to know what you mean when you use specific buzzwords.

Theory: I generally think CP theory is a reason to reject the argument not the team. Conditionality is an exception although I think you could convince me that other CP theory arguments should be voting issues. I think that plan inclusive CP's are probably bad for debate.

Case: I enjoy watching a good case debate. I think that affirmative teams tend to under utilize their case and negative teams don't do enough on the case debate.
