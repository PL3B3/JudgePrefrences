  I am a true traditional judge. I vote strictly on the standard debate and arguments In the round. I will not vote on theory, kritiks or other off case positions. 

I usually judge Public Forum Debate therefore I do not flow speed well. 

I prefer conversational speeds. 

I think the VC is very important and should be the calculus in weighing the arguments on the flow. Debaters should have a strategic and well planned out crystallization. 

I will not read evidence after the round nor will I disclose or critique.

I will write all my comments on the ballot.
