  This is my first year of judging debate. I've judged mostly public forum (both novice and varsity) and a few LD rounds. I was not on the debate team in high school so the exposure I've gotten this year is the sum of my debate experience. 

In general:
I'm ok with some speed, if you enunciate. If I can't understand you, I'll put my pen down and stop flowing.I like a logical flow of evidence with clear ties to impacts. Don't just tell me facts, tell me why they are important to your argument.I'm impressed with debaters that can calmly and respectfully counter the other team and conquer with logic over emotional slander.High speaker points go to those that can talk to me, not at me. Be authentic, relaxed, and have empathy toward me rather than just reciting facts.I appreciate good summary speeches that hit the highlights of why I should vote for you and why your arguments and impacts outweigh your opponents.
