  This is going to say what you need to know about my preferences, which is all i feel you need to know. You wont see me delve too much into why because I don't think that's particularly relevant (and i'd look like i'm talking out of my ass)

Background
Debated 4 years for Southern Lehigh High School (PA) with general experience on the national circuit. Attended VBI.

Evidence
Warrants need to be articulated. Analytical evidence is fine where logic would dictate it fits. Elsewhere, carded evidence is preferential. As a general rule, i tend to prefer credible external analysis to analytics. 

Standard
I need a standard, but other than that I don't care what it is. If it's warranted, i'll evaluate it. That being said, I need clear impacts to said standard. I will not do any work for you on the flow. All extensions need to be made and impacted to that standard, or I won't evaluate it as credible offense.

Theory
I'm fine with theory so long as it's not being used abused. In regards to responding to theory, i tend to prefer counter-interps. Because of my disinclination to evaluate bad or abusive theory, if i see it i'll be fine with just an RVI. You'll earn major brownie points if you stay topical, but I understand that's really not that common anymore among high level circuit competition.

Critical Arguments
I am not the right person to run a lot of critical positions in front of. Kritiks were always my achilles heel, mainly because I fail to understand a large portion of the critical literature used. I find it really rhetorical and hard to decipher ESPECIALLY at 350 wpm. If the argument doesn't rely on a lot of heavily rhetorical evidence, the position is fairly intuitive, and you take the time to explain it properly, i'll probably follow. Otherwise, it's probably a bad idea. I just don't understand them.

Miscellaneous
-I'm fine with a good amount of speed. What I will stress is clarity around crucial warrants, taglines and author names.
-Short of being rude, I don't really care about in-round dress or decorum. Do what you want and most important, have fun.
-I'm really generous with speaks. Lowest i'll give is around a 26 if you're really bad, but most debaters will pull a 28.
-I really hate intervening. I won't do it, so do the work on the flow for me.
-I reserve the right to call evidence after the round.
-If you don't allow your opponent access to the text of your arguments that you've read, it will severely affect your speaks.
