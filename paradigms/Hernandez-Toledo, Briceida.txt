Debate Experience: 2 years

Overview: My basic approach to policy judging is that the aff must convince me that their plan answers the resolution and improves the status quo. At the end of the debate I will ask three ask questions: 1) is the aff topical 2) do the disads that still stand on the neg outweigh ads that still stand for the aff, and 3) is there a unique and superior neg counter-plan or kritik. I vote on the worth of the plan, counter-plan, kritik regardless of my opinion of who were the better debaters; however, I assign speaking points on debating performance.
