  I graduated high school in 2009 and debated LD for 4 years, 3 years on the national circuit. I don't discount any types of arguments as long as the debater justifies it with clear warrants and explains to me how the argument should function in the round. By the end of the round, the debater should outline a decision calculus for me and show how the arguments on the flow come together to compel a ballot for his/her side.
