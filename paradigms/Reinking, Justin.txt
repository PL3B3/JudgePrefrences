I have a pretty open view of debate, whoever does the better debating wins the debate. I am open to any type or style of argumentation. I have read topical affs and I have read non-topical affs. I have read agent PICs and politics and I have read Kritiks. Sarcasm, jokes, and one-liners are funny, but they should never be rude or demeaning. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask me before the round.
