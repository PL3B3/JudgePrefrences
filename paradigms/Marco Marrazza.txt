  I debated for four years at Walt Whitman High School on both the local and national circuit. I now attend Tufts University.
 
I like smart debate. I vote based on who best meets the established standard. I will listen to all types of arguments but I prefer well-warranted arguments that are weighed against the opponents arguments and linked to the standard. In the end, I will choose a standard or burden or whatever is presented, then vote based on who best meets it.

In terms of speed, I will try to flow as much as possible, but I can't keep up if it's too fast. Also, it's not to your advantage to go too quickly or not speak clearly because that means I can't understand it and can't vote on it. In general, I am not a fan of blip extensions and probably won't vote on them. The same goes for theory, I'd rather see debate about the topic than debate itself.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me at the beginning of the round and I'll let you know.
