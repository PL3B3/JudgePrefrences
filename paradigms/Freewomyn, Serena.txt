  I have a chronic brain injury. Speak at a normal conversational rate, and we’ll be fine.

I’m open to most styles of argumentation, including: traditional stock issues; counterplans; kritiks; and performance debate. Not a fan of Zizek. Roll with feminism/queer theory and you’ll get high speaker points.

Cross-ex is a huge component of how I determine speaker points.

I have zero-tolerance for sexist/racist/homophobic/ableist language. If you use derogatory language, your speaker points will be impacted, regardless of whether or not this becomes an issue in the debate itself.
