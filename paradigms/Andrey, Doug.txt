  Overview: 
I have been involved in forensics in both in Individual Events and Policy Debate since I was a sophomore in High School. I remember winning one tournament in both my senior year. Ten years ago when a friend of mine needed a judge and asked if I would do it I got back in. In addition, I have been involved in Toastmasters where I’ve won a couple of district contest for table topics, and have worked as an a tutor for ESL PHD engineers. 

Speed: 
 Speaking fast is okay but no spreading. I will tell you to slow down if I can’t understand. 

Speaks: 
I rarely give 30’s and it is usually in the range of 27 to 29. I have been to go into the low 20’s if I hear any rudeness or off color language.

 Prep time: 
 Okay with flex prep time. And keep me informed on how much is used. 

Intervention: 
I generally will not intervene. It is your responsibility to tell me if someone has broken a rule. 

RFD:

Tell me why you should win. I base my decisions on argument not on amounts of data 

Other: 

I try to be as objective as possible.
