  Hi, im Altamish. I debated for Hebron in Texas in on the local and national circuit in both Policy and LD. 

K's: I use to run K's a lot so I'm familiar with them, just make sure you actually know what you're doing.

T/Theory: Don't run friv theory just because you can and will be more inclined to vote on RVIS. I will vote on actual abuse in the round but be warned heavy theory rounds are tough for me.

Counterplans: I ran 6 counterplans in a round once. You should know my position on them. 

Disadvantages: The better the link the better the disad.

Framework: Framework is all fine and dandy but make sure you boil it down to why your framework in a better than your opponents. I.e Education, Fairness, etc. 

Speaks: I start at a 27 and work my way up. The less boring you make the round the better speaks will be. On that note don't be rude. Any arguments like "Racism is good" will result in a 0.
